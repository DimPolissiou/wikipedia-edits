It consists of the [[Chief Justice of Singapore]] and the [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#List of judges of the Supreme Court|Judges of the High Court]]. [[Judicial Commissioner]]s are often appointed to assist with the Court's caseload. There are two specialist commercial courts, the Admiralty Court and the Intellectual Property Court, and a number of judges are designated to hear [[arbitration]]-related matters. The seat of the High Court is the [[Supreme Court of Singapore#Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]].\n\nThe High Court exercises both [[original jurisdiction]] and [[appellate jurisdiction]] in civil and criminal matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance \u2013 it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. A special aspect of the Court's original jurisdiction is its [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|judicial review jurisdiction]], under which it determines the [[Constitution of Singapore|constitutionality]] of legislation and actions taken by the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]. The Court exercises its appellate jurisdiction when it hears appeals from trials originating in the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|Subordinate Courts]] such as District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. The Court also exercises supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over subordinate courts. The exercise of [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative acts]] carried out by public authorities to ensure that they comply with principles of [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]] is an aspect of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the principles of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In turn, decisions of the High Court must be followed by District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. On the other hand, a Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges. As a matter of [[comity]], though, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision unless there is a good reason to do so. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, it is up to the Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.\n\n==History==\nIn 1826, [[Singapore]] was united with [[Malacca]] and Prince of Wales' Island (present-day [[Penang]]) to form the [[Straits Settlements]], which were granted a Court of Judicature by the Second Charter of Justice dated 27 November 1826.<ref>{{citation|title=[[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] Establishing the Court of Judicature at Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore, and Malacca dated 27 November 1826|location=London|publisher=Printed by J L Cox|year=1827}}.</ref> The Charter conferred on the Court the jurisdiction of the Courts of [[Court of King's Bench|King's Bench]], [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]] and [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]] in civil, criminal and revenue matters, among other things. The judges of the Court were the [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor]], the Resident Counsellor, and the [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca. The Governor's power to overrule decisions of the Recorder led to dissatisfaction as the Recorder was the only member of the Court who was a professional judge, and there were calls for the executive and judicial branches to be separated. This issue was not resolved by the Third Charter of Justice<ref>{{citation|title=Letters Patent for Reconstituting the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore, and Malacca: 10th August \u2014 19th Vict 1855|location=London|publisher=Printed by Cox (Bros) & Wyman|year=1855}}.</ref> granted to the Straits Settlements on 12 August 1855, though there were now to be two Recorders, one for Penang and the other for Singapore and Malacca.

By this time Singapore had become the centre of government and trade in the Straits Settlements, so the Chief Justice and Senior Puisne Judge resided in Singapore, while the Judge of Penang and the Junior Puisne Judge were stationed in Penang. The Supreme Court was also given jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal. As a result of legislation passed in 1885,<ref>Ordinance No. XV of 1885 (Straits Settlements).</ref> the Supreme Court consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. The Court was significantly altered in 1907.<ref>By the Courts Ordinance 1907 (No. XXX of 1907, Straits Settlements).</ref> It now had two divisions, one exercising [[original jurisdiction|original civil and criminal jurisdiction]] and the other [[appellate jurisdiction|appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction]].<ref>Chionh, \"Development of the Court System\", pp. 104\u2013106.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] (1942\u20131945), all the courts that had operated under the British were replaced by new courts established by the Japanese Military Administration. The Syonan Koto-Hoin (Supreme Court) was formed on 29 May 1942; there was also a Court of Appeal, but it was never convened. Following the end of [[World War II]], the courts that had existed before the war were restored and remained largely unchanged until Singapore's independence from the United Kingdom through merger with [[Malaysia]] in 1963. The judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], a [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court in Malaya]], a High Court in [[Borneo]] (now the High Court in [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]), and a High Court in Singapore.<ref>By the Malaysia Act 1963 (No. 26 of 1963, Malaysia).</ref> In 1965 Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became an independent republic. However, the High Court remained part of the Federal Court structure until 1969, when Singapore enacted the Supreme Court of Judicature Act<ref>Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (No. 24 of 1969), now the {{Singapore legislation|title=Supreme Court of Judicature Act|cap=322|ed=2007}}.</ref> to regularise the judicial system. Coming into force on 9 January 1970, the Act declared that the [[Supreme Court of Singapore]] now consisted of the Court of Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remained Singapore's highest appellate court<ref>Constitution (Amendment) Act 1969 (No. 19 of 1969).</ref> until a permanent [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] for both civil and criminal appeals was established.

In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction \u2013 it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may be penalised by having to pay higher [[costs (English law)|costs]] (legal fees) if they choose to bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60,000.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Subordinate Courts Act|cap=321|ed=2007}} (\"SCA\"), s. 52(1) read with s. 2 (definition of ''Magistrate's Court limit'').</ref> If a [[plaintiff]] commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on [[contract]], [[tort]] or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more [[costs (English law)|costs]] \u2013 legal expenses payable to her by the [[defendant]] \u2013 than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered.<ref>SCA, s. 39(1)(b). The same rule applies to matters that could have been commenced in a District Court: s. 39(1)(a).</ref> Generally, except in [[probate]] matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds [[Singapore dollar|S$]]250,000.<ref>A district court is generally entitled to hear and try actions where the amount in dispute does not exceed the district court limit, which is S$250,000: SCA, ss. 20, 21, 25, 26(b)\u2013(f), 28 and 29, read with s. 2(b) (definition of ''District Court limit'').

Unless the judge expressly directs otherwise, such a discharge does not amount to an acquittal.<ref>CPC, s. 232(2).</ref> This means that if the prosecution is able to obtain additional evidence to bolster its case, it may bring criminal proceedings against the accused again at a later stage.\n\n====Judicial review jurisdiction====\nA special aspect of the High Court's original jurisdiction is its judicial review jurisdiction.<ref>See, for example, the former s. 56A(4) of the SCA which stated that when a subordinate court referred to the High Court a question as to the interpretation or effect of a provision of the Constitution, \"the High Court shall hear and determine the constitutional question arising out of the case in the exercise of its original jurisdiction\". This provision was repealed by the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.</ref> This jurisdiction is implied rather than expressly stated in any statute. The Court exercises two types of judicial review: [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|judicial review under the Constitution of Singapore]], and [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative acts]]. However, only the first type is an exercise of the Court's judicial review jurisdiction, as judicial review of administrative acts is regarded as falling within the Court's supervisory jurisdiction ([[#Supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction|see below]]).\n\n[[File:SingaporeConstitution-1999Rep-contents-20091226-02.jpg|thumb|The 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]]]]\n\nThe [[Constitution of Singapore]] is the supreme law of Singapore.<ref name=\"Const 4\">{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}, Article 4.</ref> Ordinary laws that were in force prior to the Constitution coming into force on 9 August 1965 continue to apply after the Constitution's commencement but must be construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with the Constitution.<ref>Constitution, Arts. 2(1) (definition of ''existing law'') and 162.</ref> Any law enacted by the [[Parliament of Singapore|Legislature]] after the commencement of the Constitution which is inconsistent with the Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.<ref name=\"Const 4\"/> Thus, the Constitution reflects the principle established in the landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ''[[Marbury v.

Alternatively, during a criminal trial in a subordinate court, it is possible to apply directly to the Court of Appeal to state a case to that Court, bypassing the High Court: CPC, s. 396.</ref> The Public Prosecutor has a right to be heard at the hearing of the case stated.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(12) and 396(4).</ref> As there are no corresponding statutory provisions for civil proceedings, when constitutional issues arise in the course of such matters in a subordinate court, they will be dealt with by that court and may then be appealed to the High Court and possibly to the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party to the civil proceedings can start a separate action in the High Court for the constitutional issue to be determined.\n\n====Powers====\nThe High Court exercises powers that are vested in it by written law.<ref>SCJA, s. 18(1).</ref> For example, it has the power to:\n*order that [[evidence]] be preserved by [[search and seizure|seizure]], detention, inspection, photographing, the taking of samples, the conduct of experiments or in any manner, both before and after proceedings are commenced;<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 5.</ref>\n*transfer any proceedings to any other court, or to or from any subordinate court; and<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 10.</ref>\n*order the medical examination of a person who is a party to any proceedings where his or her physical or mental condition is relevant to any matter in question in the proceedings.<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 19.</ref>\n\nThe High Court may order that any criminal case be transferred from a subordinate criminal court to any other criminal court of equal or superior jurisdiction, or to the Court itself, whenever it appears to the Court that:<ref>CPC, s. 239.</ref>\n*a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be had in any subordinate criminal court;\n*some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise; or\n*an order is expedient for the ends of justice or is required by any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code<ref>{{Singapore legislation|no=15|year=2010}}.</ref> or other written law.\n\n===Appellate jurisdiction===\n\n====Appellate civil jurisdiction====\nWhen exercising appellate jurisdiction in civil cases, the High Court hears appeals from District Courts, Magistrates' Courts and other tribunals.<ref>SCJA, s. 20.</ref> The permission of the High Court, a District Court or Magistrate's Court is needed for an appeal from a District Court or Magistrate's Court case where the amount in dispute or the value of the subject-matter does not exceed $50,000.<ref>SCJA, s. 21(1).</ref> Such appeals are usually heard by a single judge, although if he or she thinks fit the appeal may be fixed before a court of three judges. In such cases, the appeal is decided according to the opinion of the majority of the judges.<ref>SCJA, s. 21(2).</ref> If the Court is of the view that the trial judge's decision was correct, it will dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision below. Otherwise, the appeal is allowed and the trial judge's decision is overturned.\n\nAppeals are by way of rehearing; in other words, the High Court is entitled to consider the case afresh and is not bound in any way by the decision made by the court below. However, during an appeal, [[witness]]es do not appear before the Court again to repeat their [[testimony#Legal testimony|testimony]]. Instead, the Court refers to the notes taken by the judge who presided at the trial at first instance, or the full [[transcript (law)|transcript]] of the proceedings if this is available. It also listens to legal arguments advanced by the parties' lawyers. During an appeal, the Court has the same powers as the Court of Appeal has when it hears appeals from the High Court.<ref>SCJA, s. 22.</ref>\n\n====Appellate criminal jurisdiction====\nThe High Court hears appeals from criminal cases originating in the District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. These inferior courts can also reserve points of law arising in criminal cases to be decided by the High Court.<ref>SCJA, s. 19.</ref>\n\nIn general, a person convicted by a District Court or Magistrate's Court may appeal against his or her conviction, sentence or both. However, if he or she has pleaded guilty, the appeal may only be as to the extent or legality of the sentence.<ref>CPC, s. 375.</ref> The Public Prosecutor is entitled to appeal against a person's acquittal.<ref>CPC, s. 374(3).</ref>\n\nThe High Court will not reverse or set aside a judgement, sentence or order of a subordinate court unless it is shown to its satisfaction that the judgement, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.<ref>CPC, s. 394.</ref> If there is no sufficient ground for interfering, the Court will dismiss the appeal. Otherwise, the Court may make the following orders:<ref>CPC, s. 390.</ref>\n\n*in an appeal from an acquittal, it may reverse the order and direct that further inquiry be made or that the accused should be retried or committed for trial, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him or her according to law;\n*in an appeal from a conviction, it may:\n**reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him or her to be retried or committed for trial;\n**alter the finding, maintaining the sentence; or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or\n**with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence;\n*in an appeal as to sentence, reduce or enhance the sentence, or alter the nature of the sentence; or\n*in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse the order.\n\nA District Court or Magistrate's Court may, within ten days from the time of any judgement, sentence or order passed or made, state a case on any question of law arising in the proceedings for the High Court's consideration any [[question of law]] arising in the proceedings either with or without a written application from a party to the proceedings.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(1) and (2)(b).</ref> A subordinate court may refuse to state a case for the High Court if it is of the opinion that the application for it is frivolous, except if the application is made by the Public Prosecutor. If a subordinate court refuses to state a case, an applicant may apply to the High Court for an order to compel the subordinate court to do so.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(4) and (5).</ref> The High Court hears and determines the questions of law arising on cases stated, then either affirms, amends or reverses the subordinate court's decision on the matter, or makes any other order that it sees fit.<ref>CPC, s. 398.</ref>\n\n===Supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction===\n\n====Supervisory jurisdiction====\nThe High Court has general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts.<ref>SCJA, s. 27(1).</ref> If the interests of justice appear to require it, the Court may, either of its own motion or if requested by any interested person, call for the records of any matter or proceeding in a subordinate court, whether civil or criminal, at any stage. It may then order that the matter be transferred to the High Court or give the subordinate court directions regarding how the matter should be conducted, as justice may require.<ref>SCJA, s. 27(2).</ref> When exercising supervisory or revisionary jurisdiction, it is for the Court to decide whether or not to hear submissions from any party to the proceedings; no party has a right to be heard before the Court. However, if the Court intends to make a final order that is to the prejudice of any person, that person must first be given an opportunity of being heard.<ref>SCJA, s. 28.</ref>\n\nOne important aspect of the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction is its ability to judicially review the decisions of inferior [[tribunal]]s (including subordinate courts) and other decision-making bodies and persons such as government agencies and officials.<ref>In ''Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor'' [2007] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 106, the Court of Appeal held that the High Court's power of judicial review of administrative action was based on its inherent supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals. It had existed \"historically at common law\", and remains \"very much a part of our judicial system\": p. 134, paras. 49 and 53.</ref> The jurisdiction originates from the ancient \"jurisdiction in error\" exercised by the [[Queen's Bench|King's Bench]] which is now a division of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]]. Although the exercise of this jurisdiction by the Singapore High Court is not mentioned in any statute, the Court is specifically empowered to issue to any person or authority any direction, order or [[writ]] for the enforcement of any right conferred by written law or for any other purpose, including the following [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]]:<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Schedule, para. 1.</ref>\n\n*a mandatory order (formerly known as ''[[mandamus]]'');\n*a prohibiting order (formerly known as a ''[[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]]'');\n*a quashing order (formerly known as ''[[certiorari]]''); and\n*an order for review of detention (formerly known as a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'').\n\nSuch orders were issued by the King's Bench in the exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction.\n\nIn theory, when exercising judicial review of administrative action, the Court's task is only to ensure that the decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it may disagree with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker.<ref>''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council'' [1991] 1 A.C. 521 at 561, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK); ''Pang Chen Suan v. Commissioner for Labour'' [2007] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 557, H.C. (Singapore).</ref> In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the Court is applying that principle.

In April 2010, the High Court exercised its power of criminal revision by reducing a fine payable by a man who had been prematurely released from prison more than ten years earlier due to a mistake by a clerk of the Subordinate Courts, so that the man would not have to serve additional jail time for not having paid the balance of the fine: see ''Tan Lai Kiat v.

This means if there is a decision of the Court of Appeal that is relevant to a case being heard in the High Court, the High Court must apply it even if\nit feels that the decision was wrongly decided or may cause injustice. In turn, decisions of the High Court are binding on District Courts and Magistrates' Courts.<ref>{{citation|author=Walter Woon|authorlink=Walter Woon|chapter=The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent|editor=Kevin Y L Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=Singapore University Press|year=1999|pages=297\u2013324 at 298, 301 and 306|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1 <!--(hbk.)-->}}.</ref>\n\nA Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges.

[[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]]. It consists of the [[Chief Justice of Singapore]] and the [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#List of judges of the Supreme Court|Judges of the High Court]]. [[Judicial Commissioner]]s are often appointed to assist with the Court's caseload. There are two specialist commercial courts, the Admiralty Court and the Intellectual Property Court, and a number of judges are designated to hear [[arbitration]]-related matters. The seat of the High Court is the [[Supreme Court of Singapore#Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]].\n\nThe High Court exercises both [[original jurisdiction]] and [[appellate jurisdiction]] in civil and criminal matters. By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance \u2013 it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. A special aspect of the Court's original jurisdiction is its [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|judicial review jurisdiction]], under which it determines the [[Constitution of Singapore|constitutionality]] of legislation and actions taken by the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]. The Court exercises its appellate jurisdiction when it hears appeals from trials originating in the [[Subordinate Courts of Singapore|Subordinate Courts]] such as District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. The Court also exercises supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over subordinate courts. The exercise of [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative acts]] carried out by public authorities to ensure that they comply with principles of [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law]] is an aspect of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the principles of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In turn, decisions of the High Court must be followed by District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. On the other hand, a Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges. As a matter of [[comity]], though, a Court will generally not depart from a previous decision unless there is a good reason to do so. If there are conflicting High Court decisions, it is up to the Court of Appeal to decide which decision is correct.\n\n==History==\nIn 1826, [[Singapore]] was united with [[Malacca]] and Prince of Wales' Island (present-day [[Penang]]) to form the [[Straits Settlements]], which were granted a Court of Judicature by the Second Charter of Justice dated 27 November 1826.<ref>{{citation|title=[[Letters patent|Letters Patent]] Establishing the Court of Judicature at Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore, and Malacca dated 27 November 1826|location=London|publisher=Printed by J L Cox|year=1827}}.</ref> The Charter conferred on the Court the jurisdiction of the Courts of [[Court of King's Bench|King's Bench]], [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]], [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]] and [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]] in civil, criminal and revenue matters, among other things. The judges of the Court were the [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor]], the Resident Counsellor, and the [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca. The Governor's power to overrule decisions of the Recorder led to dissatisfaction as the Recorder was the only member of the Court who was a professional judge, and there were calls for the executive and judicial branches to be separated. This issue was not resolved by the Third Charter of Justice<ref>{{citation|title=Letters Patent for Reconstituting the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore, and Malacca: 10th August \u2014 19th Vict 1855|location=London|publisher=Printed by Cox (Bros) & Wyman|year=1855}}.</ref> granted to the Straits Settlements on 12 August 1855, though there were now to be two Recorders, one for Penang and the other for Singapore and Malacca.

The Supreme Court was also given jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal. As a result of legislation passed in 1885,<ref>Ordinance No. XV of 1885 (Straits Settlements).</ref> the Supreme Court consisted of the Chief Justice and three puisne judges. The Court was significantly altered in 1907.<ref>By the Courts Ordinance 1907 (No. XXX of 1907, Straits Settlements).</ref> It now had two divisions, one exercising [[original jurisdiction|original civil and criminal jurisdiction]] and the other [[appellate jurisdiction|appellate civil and criminal jurisdiction]].<ref>Chionh, \"Development of the Court System\", pp. 104\u2013106.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] (1942\u20131945), all the courts that had operated under the British were replaced by new courts established by the Japanese Military Administration. The Syonan Koto-Hoin (Supreme Court) was formed on 29 May 1942; there was also a Court of Appeal, but it was never convened. Following the end of [[World War II]], the courts that had existed before the war were restored and remained largely unchanged until Singapore's independence from the United Kingdom through merger with [[Malaysia]] in 1963. The judicial power of Malaysia was vested in a [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], a [[High Courts of Malaysia|High Court in Malaya]], a High Court in [[Borneo]] (now the High Court in [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]), and a High Court in Singapore.<ref>By the Malaysia Act 1963 (No. 26 of 1963, Malaysia).</ref> In 1965 Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became an independent republic.

Ed.).</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe High Court exercises both [[original jurisdiction]] and [[appellate jurisdiction]] in civil and criminal matters.<ref>SCJA, s. 3(a).</ref> By possessing original jurisdiction, the Court is able to hear cases at first instance; in other words, it can deal with trials of matters coming before the courts for the first time. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction \u2013 it can hear any type of civil or criminal case, no matter how trivial or serious. However, in practice, parties may be penalised by having to pay higher [[costs (English law)|costs]] (legal fees) if they choose to bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. For example, a Magistrate's Court may hear civil cases where the amount claimed does not exceed [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60,000.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Subordinate Courts Act|cap=321|ed=2007}} (\"SCA\"), s. 52(1) read with s. 2 (definition of ''Magistrate's Court limit'').</ref> If a [[plaintiff]] commences an action in the High Court to recover a sum of money based on [[contract]], [[tort]] or any written law, and the suit could have been filed in a Magistrate's Court, if the plaintiff eventually succeeds in recovering a sum that does not exceed $60,000, she is not entitled to receive any more [[costs (English law)|costs]] \u2013 legal expenses payable to her by the [[defendant]] \u2013 than a Magistrate's Court would have ordered.<ref>SCA, s. 39(1)(b). The same rule applies to matters that could have been commenced in a District Court: s. 39(1)(a).</ref> Generally, except in [[probate]] matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds [[Singapore dollar|S$]]250,000.<ref>A district court is generally entitled to hear and try actions where the amount in dispute does not exceed the district court limit, which is S$250,000: SCA, ss. 20, 21, 25, 26(b)\u2013(f), 28 and 29, read with s. 2(b) (definition of ''District Court limit''). Thus, where the amount exceeds the limit, the case must be brought in the High Court.</ref> Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million,<ref>SCA, ss. 26(a) and 27, read with s. 2(a) (definition of ''District Court limit'').</ref> or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.<ref>{{Singapore legislation|title=Probate and Administration Act|cap=251|ed=2000}}, s. 47.</ref>\n\nWritten laws also specify that some criminal matters should be tried in the Subordinate Courts rather than in the High Court. A District Court, for instance, has jurisdiction to try all offences with a maximum term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years or punishable with a fine only,<ref>SCA, s. 50, read with the {{Singapore legislation|title=Criminal Procedure Code|cap=new|no=15|year=2010}} (\"CPC\"), s. 8(1).</ref> so trials of such offences are generally not held in before the High Court.

Unless the judge expressly directs otherwise, such a discharge does not amount to an acquittal.<ref>CPC, s. 232(2).</ref> This means that if the prosecution is able to obtain additional evidence to bolster its case, it may bring criminal proceedings against the accused again at a later stage.\n\n====Judicial review jurisdiction====\nA special aspect of the High Court's original jurisdiction is its judicial review jurisdiction.<ref>See, for example, the former s. 56A(4) of the SCA which stated that when a subordinate court referred to the High Court a question as to the interpretation or effect of a provision of the Constitution, \"the High Court shall hear and determine the constitutional question arising out of the case in the exercise of its original jurisdiction\". This provision was repealed by the Criminal Procedure Code 2010.</ref> This jurisdiction is implied rather than expressly stated in any statute. The Court exercises two types of judicial review: [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|judicial review under the Constitution of Singapore]], and [[judicial review#Judicial review of administrative acts|judicial review of administrative acts]]. However, only the first type is an exercise of the Court's judicial review jurisdiction, as judicial review of administrative acts is regarded as falling within the Court's supervisory jurisdiction ([[#Supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction|see below]]).\n\n[[File:SingaporeConstitution-1999Rep-contents-20091226-02.jpg|thumb|The 1999 Reprint of the [[Constitution of Singapore]]]]\n\nThe [[Constitution of Singapore]] is the supreme law of Singapore.<ref name=\"Const 4\">{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}, Article 4.</ref> Ordinary laws that were in force prior to the Constitution coming into force on 9 August 1965 continue to apply after the Constitution's commencement but must be construed with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity with the Constitution.<ref>Constitution, Arts. 2(1) (definition of ''existing law'') and 162.</ref> Any law enacted by the [[Parliament of Singapore|Legislature]] after the commencement of the Constitution which is inconsistent with the Constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency.<ref name=\"Const 4\"/> Thus, the Constitution reflects the principle established in the landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ''[[Marbury v.

This passage was also mentioned in ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong#Holding of the High Court|Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 78 at 88\u201389, para. 14, H.C. (Singapore).</ref>}}\n\nIn criminal proceedings, if a question of law arises as to the interpretation or effect of any provision of the Constitution, a party may apply to the trial court for a [[Case Stated|case to be stated]] on the legal question to a \"relevant court\" for its decision. Where the trial court is a subordinate court the relevant court is the High Court; and where the trial court is the High Court the relevant court is the Court of Appeal.<ref>CPC, s. 395. Alternatively, during a criminal trial in a subordinate court, it is possible to apply directly to the Court of Appeal to state a case to that Court, bypassing the High Court: CPC, s. 396.</ref> The Public Prosecutor has a right to be heard at the hearing of the case stated.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(12) and 396(4).</ref> As there are no corresponding statutory provisions for civil proceedings, when constitutional issues arise in the course of such matters in a subordinate court, they will be dealt with by that court and may then be appealed to the High Court and possibly to the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party to the civil proceedings can start a separate action in the High Court for the constitutional issue to be determined.\n\n====Powers====\nThe High Court exercises powers that are vested in it by written law.<ref>SCJA, s. 18(1).</ref> For example, it has the power to:\n*order that [[evidence]] be preserved by [[search and seizure|seizure]], detention, inspection, photographing, the taking of samples, the conduct of experiments or in any manner, both before and after proceedings are commenced;<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 5.</ref>\n*transfer any proceedings to any other court, or to or from any subordinate court; and<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 10.</ref>\n*order the medical examination of a person who is a party to any proceedings where his or her physical or mental condition is relevant to any matter in question in the proceedings.<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Sch., para. 19.</ref>\n\nThe High Court may order that any criminal case be transferred from a subordinate criminal court to any other criminal court of equal or superior jurisdiction, or to the Court itself, whenever it appears to the Court that:<ref>CPC, s. 239.</ref>\n*a fair and impartial inquiry or trial cannot be had in any subordinate criminal court;\n*some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise; or\n*an order is expedient for the ends of justice or is required by any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code<ref>{{Singapore legislation|no=15|year=2010}}.</ref> or other written law.\n\n===Appellate jurisdiction===\n\n====Appellate civil jurisdiction====\nWhen exercising appellate jurisdiction in civil cases, the High Court hears appeals from District Courts, Magistrates' Courts and other tribunals.<ref>SCJA, s. 20.</ref> The permission of the High Court, a District Court or Magistrate's Court is needed for an appeal from a District Court or Magistrate's Court case where the amount in dispute or the value of the subject-matter does not exceed $50,000.<ref>SCJA, s. 21(1).</ref> Such appeals are usually heard by a single judge, although if he or she thinks fit the appeal may be fixed before a court of three judges. In such cases, the appeal is decided according to the opinion of the majority of the judges.<ref>SCJA, s. 21(2).</ref> If the Court is of the view that the trial judge's decision was correct, it will dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision below. Otherwise, the appeal is allowed and the trial judge's decision is overturned.\n\nAppeals are by way of rehearing; in other words, the High Court is entitled to consider the case afresh and is not bound in any way by the decision made by the court below. However, during an appeal, [[witness]]es do not appear before the Court again to repeat their [[testimony#Legal testimony|testimony]]. Instead, the Court refers to the notes taken by the judge who presided at the trial at first instance, or the full [[transcript (law)|transcript]] of the proceedings if this is available. It also listens to legal arguments advanced by the parties' lawyers. During an appeal, the Court has the same powers as the Court of Appeal has when it hears appeals from the High Court.<ref>SCJA, s. 22.</ref>\n\n====Appellate criminal jurisdiction====\nThe High Court hears appeals from criminal cases originating in the District Courts and Magistrates' Courts. These inferior courts can also reserve points of law arising in criminal cases to be decided by the High Court.<ref>SCJA, s. 19.</ref>\n\nIn general, a person convicted by a District Court or Magistrate's Court may appeal against his or her conviction, sentence or both. However, if he or she has pleaded guilty, the appeal may only be as to the extent or legality of the sentence.<ref>CPC, s. 375.</ref> The Public Prosecutor is entitled to appeal against a person's acquittal.<ref>CPC, s. 374(3).</ref>\n\nThe High Court will not reverse or set aside a judgement, sentence or order of a subordinate court unless it is shown to its satisfaction that the judgement, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.<ref>CPC, s. 394.</ref> If there is no sufficient ground for interfering, the Court will dismiss the appeal. Otherwise, the Court may make the following orders:<ref>CPC, s. 390.</ref>\n\n*in an appeal from an acquittal, it may reverse the order and direct that further inquiry be made or that the accused should be retried or committed for trial, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him or her according to law;\n*in an appeal from a conviction, it may:\n**reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him or her to be retried or committed for trial;\n**alter the finding, maintaining the sentence; or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or\n**with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence;\n*in an appeal as to sentence, reduce or enhance the sentence, or alter the nature of the sentence; or\n*in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse the order.\n\nA District Court or Magistrate's Court may, within ten days from the time of any judgement, sentence or order passed or made, state a case on any question of law arising in the proceedings for the High Court's consideration any [[question of law]] arising in the proceedings either with or without a written application from a party to the proceedings.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(1) and (2)(b).</ref> A subordinate court may refuse to state a case for the High Court if it is of the opinion that the application for it is frivolous, except if the application is made by the Public Prosecutor. If a subordinate court refuses to state a case, an applicant may apply to the High Court for an order to compel the subordinate court to do so.<ref>CPC, ss. 395(4) and (5).</ref> The High Court hears and determines the questions of law arising on cases stated, then either affirms, amends or reverses the subordinate court's decision on the matter, or makes any other order that it sees fit.<ref>CPC, s. 398.</ref>\n\n===Supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction===\n\n====Supervisory jurisdiction====\nThe High Court has general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts.<ref>SCJA, s. 27(1).</ref> If the interests of justice appear to require it, the Court may, either of its own motion or if requested by any interested person, call for the records of any matter or proceeding in a subordinate court, whether civil or criminal, at any stage. It may then order that the matter be transferred to the High Court or give the subordinate court directions regarding how the matter should be conducted, as justice may require.<ref>SCJA, s. 27(2).</ref> When exercising supervisory or revisionary jurisdiction, it is for the Court to decide whether or not to hear submissions from any party to the proceedings; no party has a right to be heard before the Court. However, if the Court intends to make a final order that is to the prejudice of any person, that person must first be given an opportunity of being heard.<ref>SCJA, s. 28.</ref>\n\nOne important aspect of the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction is its ability to judicially review the decisions of inferior [[tribunal]]s (including subordinate courts) and other decision-making bodies and persons such as government agencies and officials.<ref>In ''Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor'' [2007] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 106, the Court of Appeal held that the High Court's power of judicial review of administrative action was based on its inherent supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals. It had existed \"historically at common law\", and remains \"very much a part of our judicial system\": p. 134, paras. 49 and 53.</ref> The jurisdiction originates from the ancient \"jurisdiction in error\" exercised by the [[Queen's Bench|King's Bench]] which is now a division of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]]. Although the exercise of this jurisdiction by the Singapore High Court is not mentioned in any statute, the Court is specifically empowered to issue to any person or authority any direction, order or [[writ]] for the enforcement of any right conferred by written law or for any other purpose, including the following [[prerogative writ|prerogative orders]]:<ref>SCJA, s. 18(2) read with the 1st Schedule, para. 1.</ref>\n\n*a mandatory order (formerly known as ''[[mandamus]]'');\n*a prohibiting order (formerly known as a ''[[prohibition (writ)|prohibition]]'');\n*a quashing order (formerly known as ''[[certiorari]]''); and\n*an order for review of detention (formerly known as a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'').\n\nSuch orders were issued by the King's Bench in the exercise of its judicial review jurisdiction.\n\nIn theory, when exercising judicial review of administrative action, the Court's task is only to ensure that the decision in question was made according to the law. Even though it may disagree with the decision, it will not substitute its own decision for that of the decision-maker.<ref>''R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council'' [1991] 1 A.C. 521 at 561, [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] (UK); ''Pang Chen Suan v. Commissioner for Labour'' [2007] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 557, H.C. (Singapore).</ref> In practice, however, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the Court is applying that principle.

In April 2010, the High Court exercised its power of criminal revision by reducing a fine payable by a man who had been prematurely released from prison more than ten years earlier due to a mistake by a clerk of the Subordinate Courts, so that the man would not have to serve additional jail time for not having paid the balance of the fine: see ''Tan Lai Kiat v.

This means if there is a decision of the Court of Appeal that is relevant to a case being heard in the High Court, the High Court must apply it even if\nit feels that the decision was wrongly decided or may cause injustice. In turn, decisions of the High Court are binding on District Courts and Magistrates' Courts.<ref>{{citation|author=Walter Woon|authorlink=Walter Woon|chapter=The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent|editor=Kevin Y L Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=Singapore University Press|year=1999|pages=297\u2013324 at 298, 301 and 306|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1 <!--(hbk.)-->}}.</ref>\n\nA Judge of the High Court is not bound by previous decisions by other High Court Judges.

In the fourth century CE small settlements of monks set up places of worship around Jebel Musa.

The Jebel al-Madhbah was evidently considered particularly sacred, as the well known ritual building known as ''[[Al Khazneh|The Treasury]]'' is carved into its base, the mountain top is covered with a number of different altars, and over 8 metres of the original peak were carved away to leave a flat surface with two 8 metre tall [[obelisk]]s sticking out of it; these obelisks, which frame the end of the path leading up to them, and are now only 6 metres tall, have led to the mountain being [[colloquial]]ly known as ''Zibb 'Atuf'', meaning ''penis of love'' in [[Arabic]]. Archaeological artifacts discovered at the top of the mountain indicate that it was once covered by polished shiny blue [[slate]], fitting with the biblical description of ''paved work of sapphire stone'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|}}</ref> biblical references to ''sapphire'' are considered by scholars to be unlikely to refer to the stone called ''[[sapphire]]'' in modern times, as ''sapphire'' had a different meaning, and wasn't even mined, before the Roman era.<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]'', ''Hoshen''</ref> Unfortunately, the removal of the original peak has destroyed most other archaeological remains from the late Bronze Age (the standard dating of the Exodus) that might previously have been present.\n\n===Arabian Peninsula===\n{{See also|Hijaz Mountains|Midian Mountains}}\n[[File:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|Map of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[File:Midian.png|thumb|Midian]]\nA suggested possible naturalistic explanation of the biblical ''devouring fire'' is that Sinai could have been an erupting [[volcano]]; this has been suggested by [[Charles Beke]],<ref name=autogenerated5>Charles Beke, ''Mount Sinai, a Volcano'' (1873)</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' (1939)</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} and [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western [[Saudi Arabia]] reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed [[Jebel Baggir]] which he called the ''Jabal al-Nour'' (meaning ''mountain of light''), a volcanic mountain at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba, with Horeb being argued to be a different mountain - the nearby Jebel Ertowa.<ref>Charles Beke, ''Sinai in Arabia and of Median'' (1878)</ref> Beke's suggestion has not found as much scholarly support as the candidature of [[Hala-'l Badr]]; the equation of Sinai with Hala-'l Badr has been advocated by [[Alois Musil]] in the early 20th century, Jean Koenig in 1971,<ref>Jean Koenig, ''Le site de Al-Jaw dans l'ancien pays de Madian''</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} and [[Colin Humphreys]] in 2003,<ref>Colin Humphreys, ''The Miracles of Exodus: A Scientist's Discovery of the Extraordinary Natural Causes of the Biblical Stories''</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} among others.\n\nThe possibility of an alternate site located in Saudi Arabia has also drawn attention due to the Apostle Paul's assertion in the first century that Mount Sinai was located in Arabia, although in Paul's time, the region of Arabia Petraea would have included both the modern Sinai peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia.

Halfway between Kadesh Barnea and Petra, in the southwest [[Negev]] desert in Israel, is ''[[Har Karkom]]'', which [[Emmanuel Anati]] excavated, and discovered to have been a major [[Paleolithic]] cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings; although the peak of religious activity at the site dates to 2350\u20132000 BCE, the exodus is dated 15 Nisan 2448 ([[Hebrew calendar]]; 1313 BCE),<ref>Ex. 16:1, 7, 13; Tal.

Edward Hull stated that, \"this traditional Sinai in every way meets the requirements of the narrative of the Exodus.\" Hull agreed with Robinson and stated he had no further doubts after studying the great amphitheater leading to the base of the granite cliff of Ras Sufsafeh, that here indeed was the location of the camp and the mount from which the laws of God was delivered to the encampment of Israelites below.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nF. W. Holland stated (Recovery of Jerusalem, 524): \"With regard to water-supply there is no other spot in the whole Peninsula which is nearly so well supplied as the neighborhood of Jebel Musa. ... There is also no other district in the Peninsula which affords such excellent pasturage.\"\n<ref name=\"bibleatlas.org\"/>\n\nCalculating the travels of the Israelites, the Bible Atlas states, \"These distances will not, however, allow of our placing Sinai farther East than Jebel Musa.\"<ref name=\"bibleatlas.org\"/>\n\nSome point to the absence of material evidence left behind in the journey of the Israelites but Dr. Beit-Arieh wrote, \"Perhaps it will be argued, by those who subscribe to the traditional account in the Bible, that the Israelite material culture was only of the flimsiest kind and left no trace. Presumably the Israelite dwellings and artifacts consisted only of perishable materials.\" <ref>Beit-Arieh 1988: 37</ref> Hoffmeier wrote, \"None of the encampments of the wilderness wanderings can be meaningful if the Israelites went directly to either Kadesh or Midian ... a journey of eleven days from Kadesh to Horeb can be properly understood only in relationship to the southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLocal Bedouins who have long inhabited the area have identified Jebel Musa as Mount Sinai. In the fourth century CE small settlements of monks set up places of worship around Jebel Musa. An Egyptian pilgrim named [[Ammonius the Hermit|Ammonius]], who had in past times made various visits to the area, identified Jebel Musa as the Holy Mount in the 4th century. [[Helena (empress)|Empress Helena]], ca. 330 CE, built a church to protect monks against raids from nomads. She chose the site for the church from the identification which had been handed down through generations through the Bedouins. She also reported the site was confirmed to her in a dream.<ref>Lina Eckenstein, A History of Sinai (London & New York, 1921 [AMS Press, New York, 1980 reprint]) pp. 99 fn. 1, 178\u201379; James Bentley, Secrets of Mount Sinai (Doubleday, New York, 1986 [Orbis, London, 1985]) p. 58; [[Edith Deen]], Great Women of the Christian Faith (Harper & Row, New York, 1959 [Barbour & Co., Westwood, N.J., reprint]) pp. 7\u201310</ref>\n\nThe [[Sinai peninsula]] has traditionally been considered Sinai's location by Christians, although the peninsula gained its name from this tradition, and was not called that in [[Josephus]]' time or earlier.<ref name=autogenerated7 /> (The Sinai was earlier inhabited by the Monitu and was called ''Mafkat'' or ''Country of Turquoise''.) \n\n[[Bedouin]] tradition considered [[Jabal Musa]], which lies adjacent to Mount Catherine, to be the biblical mountain,<ref name=autogenerated7 /> and it is this mountain that local tour groups and religious groups presently advertise as ''the'' biblical Mount Sinai. Evidently this view was eventually taken up by Christian groups as well, as in the 16th century a church was constructed at the peak of this mountain, which was replaced by a Greek Orthodox chapel in 1954.\n\n===Other Southern Sinai Peninsula===\nIn early Christian times, a number of [[Anchorites]] settled on [[Mount Serbal]], considering it to be the biblical mountain, and in the 4th century a monastery was constructed at its base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14011a.htm|publisher=New Advent, The Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Sinai}}</ref> Nevertheless, Josephus had stated that Mount Sinai was \"the highest of all the mountains thereabout\",<ref>[[Flavius Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', 2:12</ref> which would imply that [[Mount Catherine]] was actually the mountain in question, if Sinai was to be sited on the Sinai peninsula at all.<ref name=autogenerated7 />\n\n===Northern Sinai Peninsula===\nAccording to textual scholars, in the [[JE]] version of the Exodus narrative, the Israelites travel in a roughly straight line to [[Kadesh Barnea]] from the ''[[Yam Suph]]'' (literally meaning \"the [[Reed Sea]]\", but considered traditionally to refer to the [[Red Sea]]), and the detour via the south of the Sinai peninsula is only present in the [[Priestly Source]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''</ref> A number of scholars and commentators have therefore looked towards the more central and northern parts of the Sinai peninsula for the mountain. [[Mount Sin Bishar]], in the west-central part of the peninsula, was proposed to be the biblical Mount Sinai by Menashe Har-El, a biblical [[geographer]] at [[Tel Aviv University]].<ref>Menashe Har-El, ''The Sinai Journeys: The Route of the Exodus''</ref> [[Mount Helal]], in the north of the peninsula has also been proposed.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jarvis |first=C.S. |title=The forty years' wandering of the Israelites |journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly |year=1938 |pages=25\u201340}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |chapter=Kadesh Barnea: Some geographical and historical remarks |last=de Geus |first=C.H.J. |year=1977 |editor-last=Brongers |editor-first=Hendrik Antonie |title=Instruction and Interpretation: Studies in Hebrew Language, Palestinian archaeology and biblical exegesis |place=Leiden |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=90-04-05433-2}}</ref> Another northern Sinai suggestion is [[Hashem el-Tarif]], some 30&nbsp;km west of [[Eilat]], [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite web|author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=26792 |title=Gebel Khashm el Tarif [Jebel Hashem al Taref, Hashem el-Tarif, Mount Sinai (?)&#93; Ancient Temple : The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |access-date=2014-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|author=Simcha Jacobovici |url=http://www.simchajtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jacobovici-The-Real-Mount-Sinaiwith-pictures.doc |title=The Real Mount Sinai }}</ref>\n\n===Edom/Nabatea===\n[[File:Petra First Glimpse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Siq, facing the ''Treasury'', at the foot of [[Jebel al-Madhbah]] ]]\nSince Moses is described by the Bible as encountering [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Kenite who was a Midianite priest, shortly before encountering Sinai, this suggests that Sinai would be somewhere near their territory in Saudi Arabia;<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name=autogenerated6 /> the Kenites and Midianites appear to have resided east of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name=autogenerated6 /> Additionally, the [[Song of Deborah]], which some textual scholars consider one of the oldest parts of the Bible,<ref name=autogenerated4 /> portrays God as having dwelt at [[Mount Seir]], and seems to suggest that this equates with Mount Sinai;<ref name=autogenerated7 /><ref name=autogenerated8 /> Mount Seir designates the mountain range in the centre of [[Edom]].\n\nBased on a number of local names and features, in 1927 Ditlef Nielsen identified the ''[[Jebel al-Madhbah]]'' (meaning ''mountain of the Altar'') at [[Petra]] as being identical to the biblical Mount Sinai;<ref>Ditlef Nielsen, ''The Site of the Biblical Mount Sinai \u2013 A Claim for Petra'' (1927)</ref> since then other scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} have also made the identification.\n\nThe valley in which Petra resides is known as the ''[[Wadi Musa]]'', meaning ''valley of Moses'', and at the entrance to the [[Siq]] is the Ain Musa, meaning ''spring of Moses''; the 13th century Arab [[chronicle]]r [[Numari]] stated that Ain Musa was [[Meribah|the location where Moses had brought water from the ground, by striking it with his rod]]. The Jebel al-Madhbah was evidently considered particularly sacred, as the well known ritual building known as ''[[Al Khazneh|The Treasury]]'' is carved into its base, the mountain top is covered with a number of different altars, and over 8 metres of the original peak were carved away to leave a flat surface with two 8 metre tall [[obelisk]]s sticking out of it; these obelisks, which frame the end of the path leading up to them, and are now only 6 metres tall, have led to the mountain being [[colloquial]]ly known as ''Zibb 'Atuf'', meaning ''penis of love'' in [[Arabic]]. Archaeological artifacts discovered at the top of the mountain indicate that it was once covered by polished shiny blue [[slate]], fitting with the biblical description of ''paved work of sapphire stone'';<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|24:10|}}</ref> biblical references to ''sapphire'' are considered by scholars to be unlikely to refer to the stone called ''[[sapphire]]'' in modern times, as ''sapphire'' had a different meaning, and wasn't even mined, before the Roman era.<ref>Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]'', ''Hoshen''</ref> Unfortunately, the removal of the original peak has destroyed most other archaeological remains from the late Bronze Age (the standard dating of the Exodus) that might previously have been present.\n\n===Arabian Peninsula===\n{{See also|Hijaz Mountains|Midian Mountains}}\n[[File:Saudi Arabia map.png|thumb|Map of Saudi Arabia]]\n[[File:Midian.png|thumb|Midian]]\nA suggested possible naturalistic explanation of the biblical ''devouring fire'' is that Sinai could have been an erupting [[volcano]]; this has been suggested by [[Charles Beke]],<ref name=autogenerated5>Charles Beke, ''Mount Sinai, a Volcano'' (1873)</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'' (1939)</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} and [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western [[Saudi Arabia]] reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed [[Jebel Baggir]] which he called the ''Jabal al-Nour'' (meaning ''mountain of light''), a volcanic mountain at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba, with Horeb being argued to be a different mountain - the nearby Jebel Ertowa.<ref>Charles Beke, ''Sinai in Arabia and of Median'' (1878)</ref> Beke's suggestion has not found as much scholarly support as the candidature of [[Hala-'l Badr]]; the equation of Sinai with Hala-'l Badr has been advocated by [[Alois Musil]] in the early 20th century, Jean Koenig in 1971,<ref>Jean Koenig, ''Le site de Al-Jaw dans l'ancien pays de Madian''</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} and [[Colin Humphreys]] in 2003,<ref>Colin Humphreys, ''The Miracles of Exodus: A Scientist's Discovery of the Extraordinary Natural Causes of the Biblical Stories''</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} among others.\n\nThe possibility of an alternate site located in Saudi Arabia has also drawn attention due to the Apostle Paul's assertion in the first century that Mount Sinai was located in Arabia, although in Paul's time, the region of Arabia Petraea would have included both the modern Sinai peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia. A possible candidate within the Arabia theory has been that of ''[[Jabal al-Lawz]]'' (meaning 'mountain of almonds').\n\nAdvocates for Jabal al-Lawz include [[Lennart Moller]]<ref>Lennart M\u00f6ller, ''The Exodus Case: New Discoveries of the Historical Exodus''</ref>{{complete citation needed|date=March 2019}} (a Swedish professor in environmental medicine) and also [[Ron Wyatt]], [[Bob Cornuke]] and Larry Williams.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Mark|title=In Search of Noah's Ark: Wyatt's quest: Part 8 |url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=21016|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=Baptist Press|date=June 17, 2005}}</ref><ref>The Mountain of Moses: The Discovery of Mount Sinai, by Larry Williams, (Wynwood Press, New York, 1990; reprinted as The Discovery of Mount Sinai, 1997) p. 182.</ref><ref>Wilson, Jennifer.

Halfway between Kadesh Barnea and Petra, in the southwest [[Negev]] desert in Israel, is ''[[Har Karkom]]'', which [[Emmanuel Anati]] excavated, and discovered to have been a major [[Paleolithic]] cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings; although the peak of religious activity at the site dates to 2350\u20132000 BCE, the exodus is dated 15 Nisan 2448 ([[Hebrew calendar]]; 1313 BCE),<ref>Ex. 16:1, 7, 13; Tal.

He later earned a doctorate for his thesis titled:  'Aesthetic Indian Music as a bridge between Christian and Indian Religious Music'.\n\n==Career==\nBack in Goa, he taught music at the Seminary of Saligao-Pilerne and at the [[Rachol Seminary]] of the [[Archdiocese of Goa and Daman]], where he trained future priests in the divine chants. He conducted the [[Santa Cecilia Choir]] of [[Rachol Seminary]], and raised the level of music in the Seminary to a high standard.\n\nHe authored more than 100 compositions, some based on Indian '[[Raga]]s', which were performed by various orchestras and musical ensembles in major capitals of the world.  In addition to some of his performances which were beamed worldwide via satellite, he gave live piano, violin and [[organ recital]]s in Italy, Switzerland, Austria, England, and the United States of America.\n\nIn February 1977, Maestro [[Ant\u00f3nio Fortunato de Figueiredo]] handed over the directorship of Western Music wing of [[Goa Kala Academy]] and the conductorship of [[Goa Symphony Orchestra]] to Lourdino Barreto.  During his tenure as Director of Western Music for [[Goa Kala Academy]], Barreto formed the Goa Philharmonic Choir.  His choir interpreted western, Indian and Goan choral music, as well as staged a few operettas, Broadway musicals and a full-length opera, Verdi's Il Trovatore.  At his urging, music was for the very first time introduced as a subject at the Higher Secondary Education in Goa.\n\nHe died on 24 January 1997, a few months before he would have represented India at the Franz Schubert International Festival organized by Austria to commemorate [[Franz Schubert|Schubert\u2019s]] second birth centenary.\n\n==Major musical compositions==\n*Sam Fransisku Xaviera<ref>[http://www.goa-world.com/goa/konkani/hyms-sfx.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111001858/http://www.goa-world.com/goa/konkani/hyms-sfx.htm |date=11 January 2006 }}</ref>\n*Dogi Tegi Beatini\n*[[Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram]]\n\n==Major stage performances==\n*Fiddler on the Roof\n*Mikado\n*My Fair Lady\n*Oliver Twist\n*Orpheus in the Underworld\n*Wizard of Oz \n*Sound of Music\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.kalaacademy.org/Schedule1.htm Fr.

It stars [[Ryan Gosling]] as a [[jazz pianist]] and [[Emma Stone]] as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in [[Los Angeles]]. [[John Legend]], [[Rosemarie DeWitt]], [[Finn Wittrock]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] also star.\n\nHaving been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongside [[Justin Hurwitz]] while attending [[Harvard University]] together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film ''[[Whiplash (2014 film)|Whiplash]],'' the project was picked up by [[Summit Entertainment]]. Filming took place in Los Angeles from August to September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by [[Mandy Moore (choreographer)|Mandy Moore]]. ''La La Land'' premiered at the [[73rd Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\n\n''La La Land'' was praised for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, the musical score, musical numbers, cinematography, and production design. Both the [[American Film Institute]] and [[National Board of Review]] selected ''La La Land'' as one of the top ten films of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |title=AFI Awards: Best Of 2016 List Includes 'Silence', 'Hacksaw Ridge' & More |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=December 8, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016| archivedate=December 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222192150/http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2016/ |title=National Board of Review Announces 2016 Award Winners |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |date=November 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> It won a record-breaking seven awards from its seven nominations at the [[74th Golden Globe Awards|74th Golden Globes]] and received eleven nominations at the [[70th British Academy Film Awards]], winning five awards, including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]].

After a bad day at work, Mia's subsequent [[audition]] goes poorly when the casting director takes a call during an emotional scene. That night, Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career; after her car is towed, she is forced to walk home in disappointment.\n\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play traditional [[Christmas]] pieces. Mia overhears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant to witness Sebastian being fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off. Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop [[cover band]]. After the gig, the two walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite the clear chemistry between them.\n\nSebastian arrives at Mia's work, and she shows him around the [[Warner Bros.]] [[backlot]], where she works as a [[barista]], while explaining her passion for acting. Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Sebastian invites Mia to a screening of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''; Mia accepts, forgetting a commitment with her boyfriend Greg. Bored with the latter date, she goes to the theater and finds Sebastian as the film begins. The two conclude their evening with a romantic visit to the [[Griffith Observatory]].\n\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Sebastian's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two move in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his [[jazz fusion]] band, where he will enjoy a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs on after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia realizes that this is not the type of music Sebastian wants to perform.\n\nDuring the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while Sebastian claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a photo shoot he had forgotten about. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unwilling to forgive Sebastian for missing the play and their last night's argument, Mia ends their relationship and moves back home to [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]].\n\nSebastian receives a call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play and invites her to audition for an upcoming film. Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to attend. During the audition, Mia is asked simply to tell a story; in response, Mia sings a story about how her aunt (a theater actress who eventually died of alcoholism) inspired her to chase her dreams. Sebastian, confident the audition was a success, encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two profess they will always love each other but are uncertain of their future together.\n\nFive years later, Eithar is a famous actress and is married to another man, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Noticing the logo she had once designed, Eithar realizes Saad has opened his own club. When Saad notices Eithar in the crowd, he begins to play their love theme on the piano. A dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been, had their relationship thrived alongside their careers.

Production designer David Wasco said, \"I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed.\" Not every portion of the highway was blocked.<ref name=\"TheHR\" /> Chazelle compared the scene to the [[yellow brick road]] leading to the [[Emerald City]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"TheHR\" />\n \n[[File:Angels Flights-13.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|The [[Angels Flight]] (pictured), which was shut down for about four years, including at the time of the filming, was re-opened for a single day exclusively for the film to shoot a scene]]\n\nChazelle scouted for \"old L.A.\" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. The [[funicular]] had been closed in 2013 after a derailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017).<ref name=\"NYLA\" /> Mia works at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be \"monuments\" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature, ''[[Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench]]'' (2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical.<ref name=\"NYLA\" />\n\nThe six-minute-long Prius car scene had to be completed during the brief \"[[golden hour (photography)|magic hour]]\" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, \"everybody just exploded,\" Stone said.<ref name=\"VOGUE\" /> Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors.<ref name=\"YM\" /> While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene.<ref name=\"YM\" />\n\nThe argument during the romantic dinner that Sebastian prepared for Mia was one of the scenes that was re-written more than any other. Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements.<ref>{{cite news

It stars [[Ryan Gosling]] as a [[jazz pianist]] and [[Emma Stone]] as an aspiring actress, who meet and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in [[Los Angeles]]. [[John Legend]], [[Rosemarie DeWitt]], [[Finn Wittrock]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] also star.\n\nHaving been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongside [[Justin Hurwitz]] while attending [[Harvard University]] together. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film ''[[Whiplash (2014 film)|Whiplash]],'' the project was picked up by [[Summit Entertainment]]. Filming took place in Los Angeles from August to September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by [[Mandy Moore (choreographer)|Mandy Moore]]. ''La La Land'' premiered at the [[73rd Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.\n\n''La La Land'' was praised for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, the musical score, musical numbers, cinematography, and production design. Both the [[American Film Institute]] and [[National Board of Review]] selected ''La La Land'' as one of the top ten films of 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hipes |first=Patrick |url=http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |title=AFI Awards: Best Of 2016 List Includes 'Silence', 'Hacksaw Ridge' & More |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=December 8, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016| archivedate=December 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222192150/http://deadline.com/2016/12/afi-awards-film-2016-list-silence-sully-zootopia-1201867080/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalboardofreview.org/award-years/2016/ |title=National Board of Review Announces 2016 Award Winners |publisher=[[National Board of Review]] |date=November 29, 2016 |accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref> It won a record-breaking seven awards from its seven nominations at the [[74th Golden Globe Awards|74th Golden Globes]] and received eleven nominations at the [[70th British Academy Film Awards]], winning five awards, including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. It also received a record-tying fourteen nominations at the [[89th Academy Awards]], winning in six categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Chazelle and [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Stone.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile stuck in [[Los Angeles]] traffic, aspiring [[actress]] Mia Dolan has a moment of [[road rage]] with Sebastian Wilder, a struggling [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]]. After a bad day at work, Mia's subsequent [[audition]] goes poorly when the casting director takes a call during an emotional scene. That night, Mia's roommates take her to a lavish party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career; after her car is towed, she is forced to walk home in disappointment.\n\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Sebastian slips into a jazz improvisation despite warnings from the owner to only play traditional [[Christmas]] pieces. Mia overhears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant to witness Sebastian being fired for his disobedience. As he storms out, Mia attempts to compliment him, but he brushes her off. Months later, Mia runs into Sebastian at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop [[cover band]]. After the gig, the two walk to their cars and lament wasting a lovely night together despite the clear chemistry between them.\n\nSebastian arrives at Mia's work, and she shows him around the [[Warner Bros.]] [[backlot]], where she works as a [[barista]], while explaining her passion for acting. Sebastian takes Mia to a jazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Sebastian invites Mia to a screening of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''; Mia accepts, forgetting a commitment with her boyfriend Greg. Bored with the latter date, she goes to the theater and finds Sebastian as the film begins. The two conclude their evening with a romantic visit to the [[Griffith Observatory]].\n\nAfter more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Sebastian's encouragement, to write a one-woman play. Sebastian begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two move in together. Sebastian's former classmate Keith invites him to be the keyboardist in his [[jazz fusion]] band, where he will enjoy a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Sebastian signs on after overhearing Mia trying to convince her mother that Sebastian is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia realizes that this is not the type of music Sebastian wants to perform.\n\nDuring the band's first tour, Mia and Sebastian get into an argument; she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while Sebastian claims she liked him more when he was unsuccessful. Sebastian misses Mia's play due to a photo shoot he had forgotten about. The play is a disaster; few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unwilling to forgive Sebastian for missing the play and their last night's argument, Mia ends their relationship and moves back home to [[Boulder City, Nevada|Boulder City]].\n\nSebastian receives a call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play and invites her to audition for an upcoming film. Sebastian drives to Boulder City and persuades Mia to attend. During the audition, Mia is asked simply to tell a story; in response, Mia sings a story about how her aunt (a theater actress who eventually died of alcoholism) inspired her to chase her dreams. Sebastian, confident the audition was a success, encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two profess they will always love each other but are uncertain of their future together.\n\nFive years later, Eithar is a famous actress and is married to another man, with whom she has a daughter. One night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Noticing the logo she had once designed, Eithar realizes Saad has opened his own club. When Saad notices Eithar in the crowd, he begins to play their love theme on the piano. A dream sequence unfolds in which the two imagine what might have been, had their relationship thrived alongside their careers. Eithar shares a poignant smile with Saad, then leaves with her husband..\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Sebastian Wilder\n* [[Emma Stone]] as Mia Dolan\n* [[John Legend]] as Keith\n* [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] as Laura Wilder\n* [[Finn Wittrock]] as Greg\n* [[Callie Hernandez]] as Tracy\n* [[Sonoya Mizuno]] as Caitlin\n* [[Jessica Rothe]] as Alexis\n* [[J.

Production designer David Wasco said, \"I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed.\" Not every portion of the highway was blocked.<ref name=\"TheHR\" /> Chazelle compared the scene to the [[yellow brick road]] leading to the [[Emerald City]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).<ref name=\"TheHR\" />\n \n[[File:Angels Flights-13.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|The [[Angels Flight]] (pictured), which was shut down for about four years, including at the time of the filming, was re-opened for a single day exclusively for the film to shoot a scene]]\n\nChazelle scouted for \"old L.A.\" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. The [[funicular]] had been closed in 2013 after a derailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017).<ref name=\"NYLA\" /> Mia works at a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be \"monuments\" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature, ''[[Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench]]'' (2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical.<ref name=\"NYLA\" />\n\nThe six-minute-long Prius car scene had to be completed during the brief \"[[golden hour (photography)|magic hour]]\" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it.<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, \"everybody just exploded,\" Stone said.<ref name=\"VOGUE\" /> Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors.<ref name=\"YM\" /> While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene.<ref name=\"YM\" />\n\nThe argument during the romantic dinner that Sebastian prepared for Mia was one of the scenes that was re-written more than any other. Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements.<ref>{{cite news

Subramaniya Iyer followed the traditions of the great composer [[Tyagaraja]]. He has left behind almost one hundred compositions.\n\nSubramaniya Iyer was born in [[Thiruvaiyaru]] in [[Thanjavur]] district of present-day [[Tamil Nadu]]. His family had a long history of musical involvement - his father Bharatam Vaidyanatha Iyer was adept at both music and Sastra and his grandfather Panchanada Sastri was the court musician in the court of Serfoji Maharaja of [[Thanjavur]]. Subramaniya Iyer learnt music from his uncle, Melattur Ganapati Sastri and later under [[Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar]] who was a disciple of [[Tyagaraja]] himself.\n\nSubramaniya Iyer spent a long time in Chennapatnam ([[Chennai]]). This gave Subramaniya Iyer the prefix to his name.

He has left behind almost one hundred compositions.\n\nSubramaniya Iyer was born in [[Thiruvaiyaru]] in [[Thanjavur]] district of present day [[Tamil Nadu]]. His family had a long history of musical involvement - his father Bharatam Vaidyanatha Iyer was adept at both music and Sastra and his grandfather Panchanada Sastri was the court musician in the court of Serfoji Maharaja of [[Thanjavur]]. Subramaniya Iyer learnt music from his uncle, Melattur Ganapati Sastri and later under [[Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbayyar]] who was a disciple of [[Tyagaraja]] himself.\n\nSubramaniya Iyer spent a long time in Chennapatnam ([[Chennai]]). This gave Subramaniya Iyer the prefix to his name. Many of his students such as [[Mysore Vasudevachar]], [[Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar]], Bhairavi Kempegowda and [[Tiger Varadachariar]] became famous composers and vocalists.\n\nTwo of his famous compositions are [[Raghuvamsa Sudha|''Raghu Vamsha Sudha'']] in [[raga]] ''Kadhana Kuthuhalam'' and ''Evari Bodhanna'' in raga ''[[Abhogi]]''.
