The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times. He is the only person to have both a sibling (Bobby) and child (Al Jr.) as fellow Indy 500 winners (coincidentally, all three captured their final Indy 500 wins racing for [[Team Penske]]). Al's nephews [[Johnny Unser|Johnny]] and [[Robby Unser]] have also competed in that race.\n\nAfter his son [[Al Unser Jr.|Al Jr.]] joined the [[American Championship Car Racing|national championship]] in 1983, Unser has generally been known by the [[retronym]]ic name of \"Al Unser Sr.\" or \"Big Al.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nUnser was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, the youngest of four brothers. His father Jerry Unser and two uncles, Louis and Joe, were also drivers. Beginning in 1926 they competed in the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], an annual road race held in [[Colorado]].\n\nJoe Unser became the first member of the Unser clan to lose his life to the sport, killed while test-driving an FWD Coleman Special on the Denver highway in 1929.\n\nAl's oldest brother Jerry became the first Unser to drive at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], qualifying 23rd and finishing 31st in the [[1958 Indianapolis 500]]. However, tragedy struck the next year when he was killed from injuries sustained in a fiery crash during a practice session.\n\nMiddle brother Bobby drove in his first Indianapolis 500 in 1963, becoming in 1968 the first member of the family to win, and in 1983 son Al Unser Jr. drove in his first.\n\nUnser married Wanda Jesperson in 1958 and they had three children- Alfred Jr., Mary, and Deborah. Deborah died in a dune buggy accident in 1982.  Al and Wanda divorced in 1971 and Al married Karen Sue Barnes on November 22, 1977.\n\nAl Unser and family own and operate the [[Unser Racing Museum]] in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n==Racing career and Indianapolis 500==\nHe began racing in 1957, at age 18, initially competing primarily in modified roadsters, sprint cars and midgets. In 1965 he raced in the [[Indianapolis 500]] for the first time and finished ninth.\n\nHe won the Indy 500 in 1970, two years after his brother, Bobby. During the race, he led for all but 10 of the 200 laps and averaged {{convert|155.749|mi/h|km/h}}. His quick pit stops were a factor in the victory. That season he won a record 10 times on oval, road and dirt tracks to capture the [[United States Auto Club]] national championship. Unser competed in USAC's Stock Car division in 1967, and was the series Rookie of the Year.\n\nIn 1971 he won the Indy 500 again, starting from the fifth position with an average speed of 157.735&nbsp;mph.\n\nUnser's bid to become the first three-time consecutive Indy 500 champion was thwarted when he finished second to [[Mark Donohue]] in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nDespite starting the [[1978 Indianapolis 500]] from the fifth position in a First National City Travelers Checks [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] [[Lola Cars|Lola]], Unser's car was considered before the race to be a second-tier entry at best, if not an outright long shot to win. Moving to the front of the field for the first time on lap 75, he and opponent [[Danny Ongais]] engaged in an on-again off-again duel for 75 more laps, before an engine failure on Ongais' car on lap 150 allowed Unser to assume a commanding 35 second lead. Although suffering right front-wing misalignment due to impacting a tire on his final pit stop, a situation that led to the lead shrinking steadily over the race's final 20 laps, it nevertheless proved wide enough for victory by 9 seconds to spare at the checkered flag.  Unser's race average speed of {{convert|161.363|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} ranked as the then-second fastest ever run (one mile per hour less than the then-1972 record), and would not itself be topped for second for four more years.\n\nIn the 1983 season, Unser joined [[Team Penske]] and drove for 4 years in a Penske-owned car. Unser controlled the late stages of the [[1983 Indianapolis 500]], leading 61 laps. With less than 20 laps to go, Unser got challenges from [[Tom Sneva]] who led the most laps. With help from [[Al Unser Jr.|his son]] - who was several laps down - Unser began pulling away from Sneva. However Sneva got by Al Jr., and set sail for Unser Sr.. Sneva caught up to Unser within 1 lap of passing Al Jr., and passed him to retake the lead with 9 laps to go. Sneva then easily pulled away to win the race by 11 seconds, avenging his firing from the team in 1978. After the race, Unser Jr. was penalized 2 laps for his actions as well as having passed 2 cars under caution on lap 170.\n\n==Fourth Indianapolis 500 victory==\n[[File:Indy500winningcar1987.JPG|thumb|Al Unser's 1987 Indy 500 winning car.]]\n{{main article|1987 Indianapolis 500}}\nIn 1987, Penske's slate of drivers included [[Rick Mears]], [[Danny Sullivan]], and [[Danny Ongais]]. Al Unser Sr. was dropped from the team, and entered the month of May without a ride. During the first week of practice, Al Sr. spent much of the week shopping for a ride, and a few offers were made by owners. Al Sr., however, refused the offers, as he insisted on landing a ride in a competitive, well-funded car only. Unser planned on staying through the week, and if he did not have a ride by the end of the first week of time trials, he was planning to return home. Coincidentally, his son Al Unser Jr. (driving for [[Doug Shierson Racing|Shierson Racing]]) was having difficulty with his car's handling. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, Al Jr. surprisingly had not yet qualified. Al Sr. agreed to stay through the week in order to help his son get his car up to speed. \n\nDanny Ongais crashed into the wall during the first week of practice, suffering a serious concussion, and was declared unfit to drive. Meanwhile, the Penske team's new [[Penske PC-16]] chassis had been uncompetitive during practice. By the end of the first week of practice, Penske parked the PC-16s and elected to qualify back-up cars for the race. Mears and Sullivan were provided 1986 [[March Engineering|March]]-[[Ilmor|Ilmor Chevrolet]] machines, while a third car, a 1986 March-[[Cosworth]], was planned for third driver.\n\nMidway through the second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine combination that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel in the team's hometown of [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily put the car in the field on the third day of time trials.\n\nAt the start Unser was in the 20th position. On a day when heavy attrition felled most of the field's front-runners, including the overwhelmingly dominant [[Newman-Haas Racing|Newman-Haas]] entry of [[Mario Andretti]], Unser worked his way steadily forward and took the lead on the 183rd lap, after [[Roberto Guerrero]]'s car stalled on his final pit stop. Averaging {{convert|162.175|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, Unser bested a charging Guerrero by 4.5 seconds to win his fourth Indy 500, only five days before his 48th birthday. In doing so he tied Foyt as the winningest Indy 500 driver and broke brother Bobby's record as the oldest Indy winner.\n\nUnser rode the wave of his fourth Indy victory to secure a ride at Penske for the [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]], [[Pocono 500 (Indycar)|Pocono 500]], and [[Marlboro Challenge]] for 1987. Near the end of the year, Unser had two other starts. He drove as a substitute for [[Roberto Guerrero]] at Nazareth, and had a competitive run until crashing a few laps short of the finish. He was then hired to drive the brand new [[Porsche]] Indy car at Laguna Seca. The team was still in its infancy, and the car dropped out. Unser left the team after only one race.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989, Unser returned to Penske to secure a ride at the three 500-miles races (Indianapolis, Michigan, Pocono).\n\n==Retirement==\nAfter reorganization at [[Team Penske]] in 1990, Unser was finally crowded out of his part-time ride. With competitive rides filling up, and his career dwindling down, he joined the sub-par [[Patrick Racing]] [[Alfa Romeo]] team for 1990. After dropping out at Indy, Unser crashed in practice at Michigan and broke his leg. He quit the team after the crash.\n\nHe spent most of the month of May 1991 shopping around for a competitive ride. The restrictions on the number of leases to the Chevy Ilmor engine kept him out of a ride during the first week of practice. A last-minute deal with the [[Doug Shierson Racing#End of team|UNO/Granatelli]] team (where he would be [[Arie Luyendyk]]'s teammate) fell through when there was not enough time to prepare the car. Instead of jumping into another car \"just to make the show,\" Unser sat out the [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991 race]] and watched from the sidelines for the first time since 1969.<ref>1991 Indianapolis 500 Daily Trackside Report - Day 13, Thursday May 16, 1001 (Page D-20)</ref>\n\nIn [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]], Unser entered the month of May for the second year in a row without a ride. During the first week of practice, [[Nelson Piquet]] was involved in a serious crash, and was unable to drive. Unser was hired by [[Team Menard]] to fill the position vacated by Piquet. Unser drove to a 3rd-place finish, while his son [[Al Unser Jr.]] won the race. It was Team Menard's best Indy 500 finish, the best finish for the [[Buick]] Indy engine, and the first time the Buick engine had gone the entire {{convert|500|mi|km}}. Later in the year, Unser was selected to drive as a substitute for the injured [[Rick Mears]] at [[Firestone Indy 225|Nazareth]]. It was Unser's first start for Penske since 1989, and his final start in a CART series event. He finished 12th, earning 1 championship point.\n\nIn [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], driving for [[King Racing]], he led 15 laps at the Indianapolis 500 to extend his career laps-led record. He finished 12th, one lap down.\n\nA month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser entered the 1994 race with [[Arizona Motorsports]], hoping to qualify for what would be his 28th Indy 500. The team was very underfunded, and Unser had considerable trouble getting the car up to speed. On the first weekend of qualifying, he waved off after a poor qualifying lap. After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994.\n\n==Career highlights==\nUnser has led the most laps of any driver in the history of the Indianapolis 500, at 644. Unser tied [[Ralph DePalma]]'s long standing record of 612 laps led on the last lap of his 4th victory.\n\nUnser holds the record of being the oldest driver to ever win the 500 at 47 years old (1987), breaking the previous record set by his brother Bobby.\n\nUnser won two 500-mile races at Pocono (in 1976 and 1978) and two more at Ontario (in 1977 and 1978) bringing his total of 500-mile race wins (including four Indianapolis 500s) to eight.\n\nUnser was the 1978 [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] champion. He also competed in the 1968 [[Daytona 500]] and four other [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] & Grand National races, all held on road courses with a best finish of fourth (twice).\n\n==Awards==\n*In 1986, Unser was inducted into the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Auto Racing Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]].\n*In 1998, he was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].\n*He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1991.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/al-unser.html Al Unser] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===American open-wheel racing===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position</span>)\n\n====USAC Championship Car====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:80%\"\n|-\n!colspan=34| [[USAC Championship Car]] results\n|-\n!

The Unser family has won the Indy 500 a record nine times. He is the only person to have both a sibling (Bobby) and child (Al Jr.) as fellow Indy 500 winners (coincidentally, all three captured their final Indy 500 wins racing for [[Team Penske]]). Al's nephews [[Johnny Unser|Johnny]] and [[Robby Unser]] have also competed in that race.\n\nAfter his son [[Al Unser Jr.|Al Jr.]] joined the [[American Championship Car Racing|national championship]] in 1983, Unser has generally been known by the [[retronym]]ic name of \"Al Unser Sr.\" or \"Big Al.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nUnser was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], New Mexico, the youngest of four brothers. His father Jerry Unser and two uncles, Louis and Joe, were also drivers. Beginning in 1926 they competed in the [[Pikes Peak International Hill Climb]], an annual road race held in [[Colorado]].\n\nJoe Unser became the first member of the Unser clan to lose his life to the sport, killed while test-driving an FWD Coleman Special on the Denver highway in 1929.\n\nAl's oldest brother Jerry became the first Unser to drive at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], qualifying 23rd and finishing 31st in the [[1958 Indianapolis 500]]. However, tragedy struck the next year when he was killed from injuries sustained in a fiery crash during a practice session.\n\nMiddle brother Bobby drove in his first Indianapolis 500 in 1963, becoming in 1968 the first member of the family to win, and in 1983 son Al Unser Jr. drove in his first.\n\nUnser married Wanda Jesperson in 1958 and they had three children- Alfred Jr., Mary, and Deborah. Deborah died in a dune buggy accident in 1982.  Al and Wanda divorced in 1971 and Al married Karen Sue Barnes on November 22, 1977.\n\nAl Unser and family own and operate the [[Unser Racing Museum]] in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n==Racing career and Indianapolis 500==\nHe began racing in 1957, at age 18, initially competing primarily in modified roadsters, sprint cars and midgets. In 1965 he raced in the [[Indianapolis 500]] for the first time and finished ninth.\n\nHe won the Indy 500 in 1970, two years after his brother, Bobby. During the race, he led for all but 10 of the 200 laps and averaged {{convert|155.749|mi/h|km/h}}. His quick pit stops were a factor in the victory. That season he won a record 10 times on oval, road and dirt tracks to capture the [[United States Auto Club]] national championship. Unser competed in USAC's Stock Car division in 1967, and was the series Rookie of the Year.\n\nIn 1971 he won the Indy 500 again, starting from the fifth position with an average speed of 157.735&nbsp;mph.\n\nUnser's bid to become the first three-time consecutive Indy 500 champion was thwarted when he finished second to [[Mark Donohue]] in the [[1972 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nDespite starting the [[1978 Indianapolis 500]] from the fifth position in a First National City Travelers Checks [[Chaparral Cars|Chaparral]] [[Lola Cars|Lola]], Unser's car was considered before the race to be a second-tier entry at best, if not an outright long shot to win. Moving to the front of the field for the first time on lap 75, he and opponent [[Danny Ongais]] engaged in an on-again off-again duel for 75 more laps, before an engine failure on Ongais' car on lap 150 allowed Unser to assume a commanding 35 second lead. Although suffering right front-wing misalignment due to impacting a tire on his final pit stop, a situation that led to the lead shrinking steadily over the race's final 20 laps, it nevertheless proved wide enough for victory by 9 seconds to spare at the checkered flag.  Unser's race average speed of {{convert|161.363|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} ranked as the then-second fastest ever run (one mile per hour less than the then-1972 record), and would not itself be topped for second for four more years.\n\nIn the 1983 season, Unser joined [[Team Penske]] and drove for 4 years in a Penske-owned car. Unser controlled the late stages of the [[1983 Indianapolis 500]], leading 61 laps. With less than 20 laps to go, Unser got challenges from [[Tom Sneva]] who led the most laps. With help from [[Al Unser Jr.|his son]] - who was several laps down - Unser began pulling away from Sneva. However Sneva got by Al Jr., and set sail for Unser Sr.. Sneva caught up to Unser within 1 lap of passing Al Jr., and passed him to retake the lead with 9 laps to go. Sneva then easily pulled away to win the race by 11 seconds, avenging his firing from the team in 1978. After the race, Unser Jr. was penalized 2 laps for his actions as well as having passed 2 cars under caution on lap 170.\n\n==Fourth Indianapolis 500 victory==\n[[File:Indy500winningcar1987.JPG|thumb|Al Unser's 1987 Indy 500 winning car.]]\n{{main article|1987 Indianapolis 500}}\nIn 1987, Penske's slate of drivers included [[Rick Mears]], [[Danny Sullivan]], and [[Danny Ongais]]. Al Unser Sr. was dropped from the team, and entered the month of May without a ride. During the first week of practice, Al Sr. spent much of the week shopping for a ride, and a few offers were made by owners. Al Sr., however, refused the offers, as he insisted on landing a ride in a competitive, well-funded car only. Unser planned on staying through the week, and if he did not have a ride by the end of the first week of time trials, he was planning to return home. Coincidentally, his son Al Unser Jr. (driving for [[Doug Shierson Racing|Shierson Racing]]) was having difficulty with his car's handling. At the end of the first weekend of time trials, Al Jr. surprisingly had not yet qualified. Al Sr. agreed to stay through the week in order to help his son get his car up to speed. \n\nDanny Ongais crashed into the wall during the first week of practice, suffering a serious concussion, and was declared unfit to drive. Meanwhile, the Penske team's new [[Penske PC-16]] chassis had been uncompetitive during practice. By the end of the first week of practice, Penske parked the PC-16s and elected to qualify back-up cars for the race. Mears and Sullivan were provided 1986 [[March Engineering|March]]-[[Ilmor|Ilmor Chevrolet]] machines, while a third car, a 1986 March-[[Cosworth]], was planned for third driver.\n\nMidway through the second week of practice, Roger Penske consummated a deal with Al Sr. to drive the third car. Penske promised Unser a well-funded effort, and a brand new Cosworth engine, the same chassis/engine combination that had won the previous four Indy 500s. The year-old March was removed from a Penske Racing display at a [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotel in the team's hometown of [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], and hurriedly prepared for a return to active competition. Unser easily put the car in the field on the third day of time trials.\n\nAt the start Unser was in the 20th position. On a day when heavy attrition felled most of the field's front-runners, including the overwhelmingly dominant [[Newman-Haas Racing|Newman-Haas]] entry of [[Mario Andretti]], Unser worked his way steadily forward and took the lead on the 183rd lap, after [[Roberto Guerrero]]'s car stalled on his final pit stop. Averaging {{convert|162.175|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, Unser bested a charging Guerrero by 4.5 seconds to win his fourth Indy 500, only five days before his 48th birthday. In doing so he tied Foyt as the winningest Indy 500 driver and broke brother Bobby's record as the oldest Indy winner.\n\nUnser rode the wave of his fourth Indy victory to secure a ride at Penske for the [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan 500]], [[Pocono 500 (Indycar)|Pocono 500]], and [[Marlboro Challenge]] for 1987. Near the end of the year, Unser had two other starts. He drove as a substitute for [[Roberto Guerrero]] at Nazareth, and had a competitive run until crashing a few laps short of the finish. He was then hired to drive the brand new [[Porsche]] Indy car at Laguna Seca. The team was still in its infancy, and the car dropped out. Unser left the team after only one race.\n\nIn 1988 and 1989, Unser returned to Penske to secure a ride at the three 500-miles races (Indianapolis, Michigan, Pocono).\n\n==Retirement==\nAfter reorganization at [[Team Penske]] in 1990, Unser was finally crowded out of his part-time ride. With competitive rides filling up, and his career dwindling down, he joined the sub-par [[Patrick Racing]] [[Alfa Romeo]] team for 1990. After dropping out at Indy, Unser crashed in practice at Michigan and broke his leg. He quit the team after the crash.\n\nHe spent most of the month of May 1991 shopping around for a competitive ride. The restrictions on the number of leases to the Chevy Ilmor engine kept him out of a ride during the first week of practice. A last-minute deal with the [[Doug Shierson Racing#End of team|UNO/Granatelli]] team (where he would be [[Arie Luyendyk]]'s teammate) fell through when there was not enough time to prepare the car. Instead of jumping into another car \"just to make the show,\" Unser sat out the [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991 race]] and watched from the sidelines for the first time since 1969.<ref>1991 Indianapolis 500 Daily Trackside Report - Day 13, Thursday May 16, 1001 (Page D-20)</ref>\n\nIn [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]], Unser entered the month of May for the second year in a row without a ride. During the first week of practice, [[Nelson Piquet]] was involved in a serious crash, and was unable to drive. Unser was hired by [[Team Menard]] to fill the position vacated by Piquet. Unser drove to a 3rd-place finish, while his son [[Al Unser Jr.]] won the race. It was Team Menard's best Indy 500 finish, the best finish for the [[Buick]] Indy engine, and the first time the Buick engine had gone the entire {{convert|500|mi|km}}. Later in the year, Unser was selected to drive as a substitute for the injured [[Rick Mears]] at [[Firestone Indy 225|Nazareth]]. It was Unser's first start for Penske since 1989, and his final start in a CART series event. He finished 12th, earning 1 championship point.\n\nIn [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], driving for [[King Racing]], he led 15 laps at the Indianapolis 500 to extend his career laps-led record. He finished 12th, one lap down.\n\nA month shy of his 55th birthday, Unser entered the 1994 race with [[Arizona Motorsports]], hoping to qualify for what would be his 28th Indy 500. The team was very underfunded, and Unser had considerable trouble getting the car up to speed. On the first weekend of qualifying, he waved off after a poor qualifying lap. After some minimal practice the following day, he quit the team. He announced his retirement on May 17, 1994.\n\n==Career highlights==\nUnser has led the most laps of any driver in the history of the Indianapolis 500, at 644. Unser tied [[Ralph DePalma]]'s long standing record of 612 laps led on the last lap of his 4th victory.\n\nUnser holds the record of being the oldest driver to ever win the 500 at 47 years old (1987), breaking the previous record set by his brother Bobby.\n\nUnser won two 500-mile races at Pocono (in 1976 and 1978) and two more at Ontario (in 1977 and 1978) bringing his total of 500-mile race wins (including four Indianapolis 500s) to eight.\n\nUnser was the 1978 [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] champion.

Residents stockpiled goods, large conferences were cancelled, a state of emergency was declared, and all public universities and colleges switched to online classes. After the first case of community spread was found on March 14, Utah faced a shortage of testing kits, and public schools were ordered closed. Community spread was confirmed in more counties, and the state issued a public health order prohibiting dine-in service in restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 individuals except in grocery stores. A [[2020 Salt Lake City earthquake|5.7-magnitude earthquake]] struck the [[Wasatch Front]] on March 18, hampering the pandemic response. In late March, the state directed all people to voluntarily stay at home as much as possible.

The revolt began on 5 April 1971 and lasted till June 1971. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|armed forces]].<ref name=\"mistakes\"/> Even though its first attempt to seize power in 1971 was quickly crushed by force, in 1987 this group launched another far more potent insurgency in the south, central and western regions of the country.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|History of Sri Lanka}}\n\nCeylon (now Sri Lanka) became a [[dominion]] in 1948 with a conservative government formed under the premiership of [[D. S. Senanayake]] who had been instrumental in the negotiations with the British government that lead to self-rule. He founded the [[United National Party]] (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-dominion parties which won a majority in parliament at the general election. The UNP was defeated in 1956 when [[Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike|S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] became prime minister on a wave of nationalist sentiment. His wife [[Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike|Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] entered politics following his assassination and became the world's first female prime minister in 1960. Due to successive governments, varying economic policies, regular strikes the economic out look of Ceylon in the 1960s had fallen below what it was when it gained independence in 1948. This had even lead to an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]] in 1962.\n\nDuring the late 1960s a movement named as the JVP was initiated by [[Rohana Wijeweera]] a former medical student from the [[Lumumba University]] and a former functionary of the [[Ceylon Communist Party]]. He had been at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose and formed his own movement in 1967 with like minded youth. Wijeweera's apparent expulsion from the Peking-wing of the Ceylonese Communist Party in 1966 triggered him to form his own party followed by his Marxist ideologies which eventually was referred to as the Sinhalese Marxist Group. Along with Wijeweera, three of his close supporters emerged as the leaders of this new movement, these were Sanath, Karunnarathe and Loku  Athula.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Tom H.J.|date=June 2013|title=The Deception of Victory: The JVP in Sri Lanka and the Long-Term Dynamics of Rebel Reintegration|journal=International Peacekeeping|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=357\u2013374|doi=10.1080/13533312.2013.830024|issn=1353-3312}}</ref> Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the 16- to 25-year-old range who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called \"Five Lectures\", included discussions of Indian imperialism, the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power.\n\n==JVP Preparation==\nBetween 1967 and 1970 the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses which included the Samajawadi Sisiya Sangamaya (Socialist Student Union) and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces, some of whom actually provided sketches of police stations, airports and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \"education camps\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism-Leninism and basic military skills. The Central Committee was formed at Madampella in 1969. By 1970 a special [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|CID]] unit under [[Assistant_superintendent#Sri_Lanka|ASP]] K. C. de Silva was investigating the \"Che Guevara clique\", whom then opposition leader Sirima Bandaranaike had made a reference to in her [[May Day]] speech in 1970.<ref name=\"retrospect\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/010401/spec.html|title=The Sunday Times - Special Assignment|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, but at the same time distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera arrested before the elections in May, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. Majority of the party funding came from a string of robberies carried out by the outfit. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\nBy 1970, the JVP had started recruiting and training cadre at camps in [[Kurunegala]], [[Akmeemana]], [[Tissamaharama]], [[Elpitiya]] and [[Anuradhapura]]. Classes teaching the \"Five Lectures\" where being held in various parts of the island mostly in secluded locations such as cemeteries. They had raised a force of around 10,000 full-time members, however had stopped recruiting in 1971. The movement was based on cells of five members with a leader and there were several such cells in a police station area with an area leader. The area leaders selected a district leader to head the district. The district leaders made up the Central Committee. Above the Central Committee was the [[Politburo]] made up of 12 people including Wijeweera. All communication was by code by couriers, with the district secretaries communicating the messages from the Politburo met every two months in Colombo.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\nThe cells began arming themselves with [[shotgun]]s, with each member expected to have one with 10 cartridges as well as blue uniforms, military boots and haversacks. Home made bombs were prepared, with some exploding in the process. Such as on 17 December 1970, when [[Victor Ivan]] alias 'Podi Athula' lost his left hand and was critically wounded when grenade exploded while being tested. The JVP published its own paper, the \"Janatha Vimukthi\" (people's liberation) and carried out several robberies to rasie funds such as the Okkampitiya bank robbery, the Badulla mail bag robbery, the Ambalangoda bank robbery and the York Street robbery. Its members were asked to raise funds using personal means.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\n== Ceylon's defense establishment==\n<!--The government had disbanded the police [[special branch]] set up by the previous UNP government tasked with internal intelligence gathering and analysis. Therefore, the government lacked a dedicated intelligence agency to forewarn them of the threat.-->\nSince its formation in 1949, the [[Sri Lankan Armed Forces|Ceylon's armed force]]s functioned as an internal security force assisting the [[Ceylon Police Force]] during strikes and riots. Following the [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup in 1962]], the armed forces had faced major cuts in funding and recruitment as well as joint operations. The armed forces were ill-equipped and not prepared for a large scale insurrection. The [[Ceylon Army]] had several infantry regiments armed with World War II-era weapons, [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and [[anti aircraft gun]]s. It lacked tanks, field artillery, sub machine guns and other modern weapons; peace time ammunition stocks were found to be adequate to sustain only one week of offensive operations. The [[Royal Ceylon Navy]], which had suffered the most from the fall out of the attempted coup with recruitment frozen till 1969, had only a single [[frigate]] in its fleet. It had to deploy its crew on shore duty and were thereby incapable of preventing the JVP from gaining aid by sea. The [[Royal Ceylon Air Force]] had mothballed its jet trainers after plans for introducing jet fighters where scrapped and was limited to a small fleet of light transport aircraft and helicopters, which made up two flying squadrons and a few pilots.\n\n==Government's initial response ==\nThe Government received multiple warnings of the preparations undertaken by the JVP, yet failed to comprehend the scale of the insurrection that was about to unfold. This resulted in its unpreparedness to counter it. Early warnings came from the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Police Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), which had been traditionally tasked with [[internal security]] by the late 1969 and early 1970, when they had established the \"Che Guevara Desk\" under ASP K. C. de Silva. [[John Attygalle]], the former [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] who had been appointed special security advisor to the [[Ministry of External Affairs and Defence]], submitted a report on the potential threat from the new group to Prime Minister [[Dudley Senanayake]]'s government. The government instructed the police to arrest Wijeweera and he was taken in to custody in May 1970. However, following the [[1970 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1970 general election]], the newly elected Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike had Wijeweera released from police custody. Reports from the previous administration were overlooked. Her new administration undertook changes to the Police force, removing officers and disbanding units perceived to be loyal to the previous administration. These changes effected the CID. The new government was fearful of a potential coup against it from the security forces, lead by officers loyal to the previous administration. Bandaranaike's cousin and a volunteer officer, [[Captain]] [[Anuruddha Ratwatte]] was promoted [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and appointed commanding officer of the Army's Field Security Detachment tasked with identifying such officers. Captain [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] who lead the investigations instead reported that a more substantial treat to the government was posed from the JVP. Police investigations were started into bomb making factories.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/><ref name=\"Alles\">{{cite book |last1=Alles |first1=A.C. |title=Insurgency - 1971 |date=1976 |publisher=Trade Exchange (Ceylon) |location=Colombo}}</ref>\n\n===Decision to attack===\nOn 27 February 1971 JVP held its last public rally before the insurrection at Colombo's Hyde Park, here Wijeweera stated that \"Let the revolution of the workers, farmers and soldiers be triumphant\". On 5 March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of the JVP bomb factories killing five members, the police found 58 bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Wijeweera went on to travel around the country, but was arrested on 13 March in Ampara by a special Police team and was later transferred to the Jaffna Prison. On 16 March the government declared a state of emergency, but no military preparedness or mobilization took place. On 2 April a meeting was held at the Sangaramaya (Temple) at [[Vidyodaya University]]. The meeting was held by the top leaders of the JVP politburo in response to a request by Wijeweera that posters and leaflets calling for his release be published, and that in the event of the insurgency starting, 500 cadres be sent to Jaffna to break him out of prison. That day the group made up of S.V.A.Piyathilaka, Lionel Bopage, [[Jayadeva Uyangoda]], Sunanda Deshpriya, [[Athula Nimalasiri Jayasinghe|Loku Athula]], W.T. Karunarathne, Susi L. Wickrama, Wijesena Vidanage alias Sanath, Somasiri Kumanayake, and Anura Ranjith Kurukulasooriya decided that all [[police station]]s in the country would be attacked on the night of 5 April at 11:00&nbsp;pm. Since the JVP had considered that local police stations were the governments principle element of power locally. They hoped to remove this presence of power and see the local populaces raise up in their support bring about a revolution. The district leader for Monaragala and Wellawaya was not present at the meeting, the decision to attack was conwayed to them via a telegram that read ''\"JVP Appuhamy expired. Funeral 5.\"'''. The Wellawaya leader took the order to attack on the morning of 5 April, and not the evening as had been agreed at the meeting.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=41 Years After 1971 JVP: Where Have The Decision Makers Gone? |url=https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/41-years-after-1971-jvp-where-have-the-decision-makers-gone/ |accessdate=26 March 2020 |agency=Colombotelegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Insurrection==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n===JVP plan of attack===\nIt was discussed and agreed on 2 April, a countrywide insurrection would be launched on 5 April evening. Four important missions were planned and assigned. Major responsibly of these attacks were entrusted to the student wing, which  Wijeweera had once called the \"the Red Guard\". The first of four important missions, was the attack on the [[Panagoda Cantonment]], which was one of the largest military installations in the country and housed a large [[arsenal]]. Piyasiri was incharge of this attack with 800 students, divided into groups of twenty five each assigned to the task. A smaller attack was to be stage on [[SLAF Katunayake|RCyAF Katunayake]]. The second mission was to abduct the Prime Minister. Attack was to be lead by Nimal, [[Somawansa Amarasinghe]], Sanath Kumar and Lal Pieries with over 50 students. Third mission was the capture of the city of Colombo under Bopage. Colombo was devided into five areas, Colombo South, Colombo North, Kandy Road, Colombo Central, and Kotte. The carders were to attack police stations along the way gaining arms and ammunition from these. Key targets were, [[Welikada Prison]], [[Srawasthi Mandiraya|Srawasthi]], [[Radio Ceylon]] and several residences of government officials such as Justice Minister, [[Felix Dias Bandaranaike]]; [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Army Commander]] and the [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|IGP]]. The forth mission was rescue Wijeweera from prison in Jaffna.<ref name=\"Alles\"/><ref name=\"Gunarathna\">{{cite book |last1=Gunarathna |first1=Rohan |title=Sri Lanka: A lost Revolution, The Inside Story of the JVP |date=1990 |publisher=Institute of Fundamental Studies |location=Sri Lanka |isbn=9552600049 }}</ref>           \n\n===The Wellawaya attack===\nThe planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising.  At dawn (5.20 am) on 5 April 1971 the [[Wellawaya]] police station came under attack with two police constables were killed. The Wellawaya attack had preempted the initial wave of simultaneous  attacks planned by the JVP. They lost the key element of surprise. Following news from the attack in Wellawaya, an alerted government began frantic preparations to face further attacks. A curfew was declared and all police stations were warned of an impending attack, the armed forces began to mobilize by [[Major General]] [[D. S. Attygalle]], [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Ceylon Army]]. After dawn on 5 April, General Attygalle ordered army units of the [[Gemunu Watch]] from [[Diyatalawa]] to Wellawaya, where the initial attack had taken place.<ref name=\"Alles\"/><ref name=\"Gunarathna\"/> \n\nSeveral JVP cardres were arrested by the police at [[Viharamahadevi Park]] on 5 April as they prepared to abduct or assassinate the Prime Minister at her private residence in Rosemead place. This was follows by more arrests in Kotahena and Borella. At 8 PM, Major General Attygalle, IGP [[Stanley Senanayake]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Anuruddha Ratwatte arrived at the Prime Minister's private residence and briefed her on the attack at Wellawaya and impending attack that night. Soon after, Prime Minister left to [[Prime Minister's House (Colombo)|Temple Trees]] Prime Minister's official residence accompanied by General Attygalle, Captain Wijeratne and her normal escort. Thereafter Temple Trees became the nerve center for government operations during the crisis and had its security strengthened. It also became a refuge for ministers most of whom were from leftist parties. Helicopter patrols around the capital began as rumors started that the JVP was marching on Colombo. \n\n===Initial wave of attacks===\nWith a curfew was imposed and suspects being arrested some of the JVP leaders went into hiding. However the attack commenced as planned 92 police stations across the country were attacked simultaneously by JVP groups armed with shotguns, bombs and Molotov and five, [[Deniyaya]], [[Uragaha]], [[Rajangane]], [[Kataragama]] and [[Warakapola Divisional Secretariat|Warakapola]] overrun by the insurgents and 43 abandoned by the police for \"strategic reasons\" in the days that followed. Fifty-seven police stations were damaged. The insurgents cut telephone and power lines, blocked roads with trees. The Hanwella police station close to Colombo came under attack on the 6 April and was beaten off with army reinforcements from the Panagoda Cantonment. The No. 4 Squadron of the Royal Ceylon Air Force deployed its three [[Bell 206A JetRanger]] helicopters, which began flying missions to remote police stations to supply the stations with weapons and ammunition. In the following days, the helicopters returned wounded to hospitals. [[RCyAF Ekala]] also came under attack. The police withdrew its personnel from smaller police stations. By 10 April the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District, and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province with exception of [[Galle]] and [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] which had two old Dutch colonial forts and small army garrisons.\n\n===The government's response===\nThe government forces responded with first securing the capital Colombo; other cities and large towns with sizable police and military garrisons. A road blocks were set up, and bridges, ports, and airports were secured, overstretching the small armed forces which had stared mobilizing its [[reservist]]s. Army, navy and air force personnel were deployed on ground duty in a defensive posture at first. In most areas, the police were able to hold out interdependently. Within the first few days the government felt the situation was dire since it was found that its small arms ammunition would run out in a week and fears of infiltration of the armed forces by the JVP members appeared when a navy rating shot fellow ratings in Jaffna. \n\nDuring this time, the JVP took advantage of the weakness of the armed forces and police by capturing large areas of the country uncontested. Many army convoys were ambushed and several initial offensives were pushed back in areas like [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]], where the local [[Member of Parliament (Sri Lanka)|member of parliament]], Sumanapala Dahanayake, was wounded accompanying the first joint army and police expedition into rebel held areas in Matara.  \n\nFormer [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] (IGP) [[S.A. Dissanayake]] was appointed Additional Permanent Secretary of the [[Ministry of External Affairs and Defence]] and coordinated the government's defence activities from the situation room at Temple Trees. \n\n===International assistance===\nDesperately short of weapons and ammunition, Bandaranaike issued a distress call to friendly countries for support via [[telegram]]. The response from many governments were swift. The United Kingdom was the first respond positively, and allowed the Ceylonese government use an [[Air Ceylon]] [[Trident]] to ferry small arms and ammunition from its bases in [[Singapore]]. Pakistan responded with airlifting supplies, troops and helicopters to [[Ratmalana Airport]] and took over its defence releasing Ceylonese troops for other duties. India did not properly receive the cable and the Indian High Commissioner in Ceylon was sent back to his country carrying the message for aid from the Government of Ceylon on 13 April. Units from the [[Southern Command (India)|Indian Army Southern Command]] were airlifted from [[Bangalore]] and [[Madras]] (Chennai), to [[RCyAF Katunayake]] and five Chetak helicopters 104 Helicopter Squadron followed with more arms and ammunition. 104 Helicopter Squadron logged 573 flying hours spread across as many as 1122 sorties in Ceylon. 150 [[Indian Gorkha]]s took over the guarding RCyAF Katunayake and the [[Indian Navy]] deployed four frigates setting up a naval cordon around Ceylon since the Royal Ceylon Navy had deployed its sailors on ground operations and harbor defence, latter was later taken over by Indian and Pakistani troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vayu-sena.indianmilitaryhistory.org/other-coin-1971-ceylon.shtml|title=COIN operations in Ceylon - 1971 - Vayu Sena|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[RAF]] heavy transports flew in six Bell 47-G2 helicopters on 17 April, and also ammunition purchased from Singapore. The government also received aid from the Soviet Union, with it flying in five [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]]F fighter bombers, a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15 UTI]] trainer, as well as two [[Kamov Ka-26]] helicopters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=61809|title=The Island|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Soviet Union also sent 12 light mortars, [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] supplied 4 [[76 mm mountain gun M48|76 mm mountain guns]] and China supplied 30 [[85 mm anti-tank gun D-48|85 mm Type 60 anti-tank guns]]. The Soviet Union donated 10 [[BTR-152]]s, while Ceylon bought 18 [[Ferret armoured car]]s from the UK and received several [[Alvis Saladin]]s. China supplied 30,000 automatic and semi-automatic rifles and Australia provided 5,000 semi-automatic rifles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wickremesekera |first1=Channa |title=The Tamil Separatist War in Sri Lanka |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317293859 }}</ref>\n\n===Crackdown===\nWithin days of the start of the insurrection, the armed forces began offensive operations after the initial wave of attacks had withered away. Personnel from all three armed services deployed for offensive operations with mobilization of reservists, most of whom were World War II veterans, and with regular troops freed from guard duty as Pakistani and Indian troops took up defense of many key installations. Local coordinating officers from the three branches of the armed forces were appointed to carry out local [[counter-insurgency]] operations in districts. The RCyAF, took out of storage five [[BAC Jet Provost|Hunting Jet Provosts]] which had been mothballed in 1970, serviced and armed them in three days and flew them from [[RCyAF Chinabay]] to RCyAF Katunayake attacking rebel locations en route. Several weeks later the Jet Provosts were joined by the Bell 47-G2 in ground attack missions.\n\nAfter three weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. The government offered amnesties in May and June 1971; captured and surrounded rebels were detained in rehabilitation camps for months until they were released, numbering 20,000.\n\n==<small>Casualties</small>==\nThe official death toll was 1200, but unofficial figures reliably estimated it to be around 4000\u20135000. 41 civilians were killed by the insurgents. 37 police officers were killed and 195 wounded. 26 armed services personnel were killed (19 army, 4 air force and 3 navy) and 130 were wounded (87 army, 15 air force and 28 navy) from 1971 to 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/010408/spec.html|title=The Sunday Times - Special Assignment|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Prosecution of insurgents==\nThe Prime Minister appointed an Investigation Unit headed by retired IGP [[Aleric Abeygunawardena]] to carryout the investigations to prosecute the captured insurgents. The unit was made up of crown counsels and police officers. The crown counsels seconded to it from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department were granted the rank of [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]], in order to take statements of suspects which would be admissible in court. It soon became apparent that it would take years to convict the large number of suspects in custody within the normal procedure and laws of the day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Wickramanayake:  Well known, powerful personality |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/04/29/fea40.asp |accessdate=11 April 2020 |publisher=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal Justice Commission===\n{{main|Criminal Justice Commission (Sri Lanka)}}\nThe [[Criminal Justice Commission (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Justice Commission]] was thus established by the government to prosecute the detained rebels in a expedient manner. It was composed of Chief Justice H N G Fernando (Chairman), Justice [[A. C. Alles]], Justice V T Thamotheram, Justice H Dheragoda and Justice [[T. W. Rajaratnam]]. In 1975 Wijeweera was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment later amended to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. Many of the surviving leaders of the JVP received prison sentences. Most of the youth in rehabilitation camps were released.\n\n==Legacy==\nCeylon severed diplomatic ties with [[North Korea]] in 1971 based on allegations that it supported the JVP, diplomatic relations have not been reestablished since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=15332|title=The Island|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Under the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban on the party was lifted and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). By the late the 1980s the JVP had started a [[1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection|second insurrection]] lasting from 1987 to 1989. This was more of a [[low intensity conflict]] than an open revolution as the first insurrection in 1971.\n\n==Investigations into the causes==\nThere are two categories of casual factors. The first is structural: educated unemployment. With rapid population increase and relatively slow economic growth left most youth, who were the beneficiaries of free education, unemployed or engaged in jobs which did not meet their expectation. The unemployment rate was too high when compared to the output of the education system, which the labour market failed to absorb. The second signifying factor is a sequence of political factors: President [[J. R. Jayewardene|Jayawardena]]\u2019s political strategy of oppressing the opposition; the weakness induced in the main opposition party ([[Sri Lanka Freedom Party|SLFP]]); the subtle exclusion of those who lack political connections from access to state patronage; the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord|Indo-Sri Lankan Peace Accord]] and the entry of Indian troops to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Mick|date=July 1993|title=Thoroughly Modern Revolutionaries: The JVP in Sri Lanka|journal=Modern Asian Studies|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=593\u2013642|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00010908|issn=1469-8099}}</ref>\n\n==People involved==\n\n===Notable people killed===\n* [[Lt.

The revolt began on 5 April 1971 and lasted till June 1971. The insurgents were able to capture and hold several towns and rural areas for several weeks until they were recaptured by the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|armed forces]].<ref name=\"mistakes\"/> Even though its first attempt to seize power in 1971 was quickly crushed by force, in 1987 this group launched another far more potent insurgency in the south, central and western regions of the country.\n\n==Origins==\n{{See also|History of Sri Lanka}}\n\nCeylon (now Sri Lanka) became a [[dominion]] in 1948 with a conservative government formed under the premiership of [[D. S. Senanayake]] who had been instrumental in the negotiations with the British government that lead to self-rule. He founded the [[United National Party]] (UNP) by amalgamating three right-leaning pro-dominion parties which won a majority in parliament at the general election. The UNP was defeated in 1956 when [[Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike|S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike]] became prime minister on a wave of nationalist sentiment. His wife [[Sirimavo Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike|Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] entered politics following his assassination and became the world's first female prime minister in 1960. Due to successive governments, varying economic policies, regular strikes the economic out look of Ceylon in the 1960s had fallen below what it was when it gained independence in 1948. This had even lead to an [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]] in 1962.\n\nDuring the late 1960s a movement named as the JVP was initiated by [[Rohana Wijeweera]] a former medical student from the [[Lumumba University]] and a former functionary of the [[Ceylon Communist Party]]. He had been at odds with party leaders and impatient with its lack of revolutionary purpose and formed his own movement in 1967 with like minded youth. Wijeweera's apparent expulsion from the Peking-wing of the Ceylonese Communist Party in 1966 triggered him to form his own party followed by his Marxist ideologies which eventually was referred to as the Sinhalese Marxist Group. Along with Wijeweera, three of his close supporters emerged as the leaders of this new movement, these were Sanath, Karunnarathe and Loku  Athula.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Tom H.J.|date=June 2013|title=The Deception of Victory: The JVP in Sri Lanka and the Long-Term Dynamics of Rebel Reintegration|journal=International Peacekeeping|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=357\u2013374|doi=10.1080/13533312.2013.830024|issn=1353-3312}}</ref> Initially identified simply as the New Left, this group drew on students and unemployed youths from rural areas, most of them in the 16- to 25-year-old range who felt that their economic interests had been neglected by the nation's leftist coalitions. The standard program of indoctrination, the so-called \"Five Lectures\", included discussions of Indian imperialism, the growing economic crisis, the failure of the island's communist and socialist parties and the need for a sudden, violent seizure of power.\n\n==JVP Preparation==\nBetween 1967 and 1970 the group expanded rapidly, gaining control of the student socialist movement at a number of major university campuses which included the Samajawadi Sisiya Sangamaya (Socialist Student Union) and winning recruits and sympathizers within the armed forces, some of whom actually provided sketches of police stations, airports and military facilities that were important to the initial success of the revolt. In order to draw the newer members more tightly into the organization and to prepare them for a coming confrontation, Wijeweera opened \"education camps\" in several remote areas along the south and southwestern coasts. These camps provided training in Marxism-Leninism and basic military skills. The Central Committee was formed at Madampella in 1969. By 1970 a special [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|CID]] unit under [[Assistant_superintendent#Sri_Lanka|ASP]] K. C. de Silva was investigating the \"Che Guevara clique\", whom then opposition leader Sirima Bandaranaike had made a reference to in her [[May Day]] speech in 1970.<ref name=\"retrospect\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/010401/spec.html|title=The Sunday Times - Special Assignment|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile developing secret cells and regional commands, Wijeweera's group also began to take a more public role during the elections of 1970. His cadres campaigned openly for the United Front of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, but at the same time distributed posters and pamphlets promising violent rebellion if Bandaranaike did not address the interests of the proletariat. In a manifesto issued during this period, the group used the name Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for the first time. Because of the subversive tone of these publications, the United National Party government had Wijeweera arrested before the elections in May, but the victorious Bandaranaike ordered his release in July 1970. In the politically tolerant atmosphere of the next few months, as the new government attempted to win over a wide variety of unorthodox leftist groups, the JVP intensified both the public campaign and the private preparations for a revolt. Although their group was relatively small, the members hoped to immobilize the government by selective kidnapping and sudden, simultaneous strikes against the security forces throughout the island. Some of the necessary weapons had been bought with funds supplied by the members. Majority of the party funding came from a string of robberies carried out by the outfit. For the most part, however, they relied on raids against police stations and army camps to secure weapons, and they manufactured their own bombs.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\nBy 1970, the JVP had started recruiting and training cadre at camps in [[Kurunegala]], [[Akmeemana]], [[Tissamaharama]], [[Elpitiya]] and [[Anuradhapura]]. Classes teaching the \"Five Lectures\" where being held in various parts of the island mostly in secluded locations such as cemeteries. They had raised a force of around 10,000 full-time members, however had stopped recruiting in 1971. The movement was based on cells of five members with a leader and there were several such cells in a police station area with an area leader. The area leaders selected a district leader to head the district. The district leaders made up the Central Committee. Above the Central Committee was the [[Politburo]] made up of 12 people including Wijeweera. All communication was by code by couriers, with the district secretaries communicating the messages from the Politburo met every two months in Colombo.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\nThe cells began arming themselves with [[shotgun]]s, with each member expected to have one with 10 cartridges as well as blue uniforms, military boots and haversacks. Home made bombs were prepared, with some exploding in the process. Such as on 17 December 1970, when [[Victor Ivan]] alias 'Podi Athula' lost his left hand and was critically wounded when grenade exploded while being tested. The JVP published its own paper, the \"Janatha Vimukthi\" (people's liberation) and carried out several robberies to rasie funds such as the Okkampitiya bank robbery, the Badulla mail bag robbery, the Ambalangoda bank robbery and the York Street robbery. Its members were asked to raise funds using personal means.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/>\n\n== Ceylon's defense establishment==\n<!--The government had disbanded the police [[special branch]] set up by the previous UNP government tasked with internal intelligence gathering and analysis. Therefore, the government lacked a dedicated intelligence agency to forewarn them of the threat.-->\nSince its formation in 1949, the [[Sri Lankan Armed Forces|Ceylon's armed force]]s functioned as an internal security force assisting the [[Ceylon Police Force]] during strikes and riots. Following the [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup in 1962]], the armed forces had faced major cuts in funding and recruitment as well as joint operations. The armed forces were ill-equipped and not prepared for a large scale insurrection. The [[Ceylon Army]] had several infantry regiments armed with World War II-era weapons, [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and [[anti aircraft gun]]s. It lacked tanks, field artillery, sub machine guns and other modern weapons; peace time ammunition stocks were found to be adequate to sustain only one week of offensive operations. The [[Royal Ceylon Navy]], which had suffered the most from the fall out of the attempted coup with recruitment frozen till 1969, had only a single [[frigate]] in its fleet. It had to deploy its crew on shore duty and were thereby incapable of preventing the JVP from gaining aid by sea. The [[Royal Ceylon Air Force]] had mothballed its jet trainers after plans for introducing jet fighters where scrapped and was limited to a small fleet of light transport aircraft and helicopters, which made up two flying squadrons and a few pilots.\n\n==Government's initial response ==\nThe Government received multiple warnings of the preparations undertaken by the JVP, yet failed to comprehend the scale of the insurrection that was about to unfold. This resulted in its unpreparedness to counter it. Early warnings came from the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Police Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), which had been traditionally tasked with [[internal security]] by the late 1969 and early 1970, when they had established the \"Che Guevara Desk\" under ASP K. C. de Silva. [[John Attygalle]], the former [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] who had been appointed special security advisor to the [[Ministry of External Affairs and Defence]], submitted a report on the potential threat from the new group to Prime Minister [[Dudley Senanayake]]'s government. The government instructed the police to arrest Wijeweera and he was taken in to custody in May 1970. However, following the [[1970 Ceylonese parliamentary election|1970 general election]], the newly elected Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike had Wijeweera released from police custody. Reports from the previous administration were overlooked. Her new administration undertook changes to the Police force, removing officers and disbanding units perceived to be loyal to the previous administration. These changes effected the CID. The new government was fearful of a potential coup against it from the security forces, lead by officers loyal to the previous administration. Bandaranaike's cousin and a volunteer officer, [[Captain]] [[Anuruddha Ratwatte]] was promoted [[Lieutenant Colonel]] and appointed commanding officer of the Army's Field Security Detachment tasked with identifying such officers. Captain [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] who lead the investigations instead reported that a more substantial treat to the government was posed from the JVP. Police investigations were started into bomb making factories.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/><ref name=\"Alles\">{{cite book |last1=Alles |first1=A.C. |title=Insurgency - 1971 |date=1976 |publisher=Trade Exchange (Ceylon) |location=Colombo}}</ref>\n\n===Decision to attack===\nOn 27 February 1971 JVP held its last public rally before the insurrection at Colombo's Hyde Park, here Wijeweera stated that \"Let the revolution of the workers, farmers and soldiers be triumphant\". On 5 March 1971, after an accidental explosion in one of the JVP bomb factories killing five members, the police found 58 bombs in a hut in Nelundeniya, Kegalla District. Wijeweera went on to travel around the country, but was arrested on 13 March in Ampara by a special Police team and was later transferred to the Jaffna Prison. On 16 March the government declared a state of emergency, but no military preparedness or mobilization took place. On 2 April a meeting was held at the Sangaramaya (Temple) at [[Vidyodaya University]]. The meeting was held by the top leaders of the JVP politburo in response to a request by Wijeweera that posters and leaflets calling for his release be published, and that in the event of the insurgency starting, 500 cadres be sent to Jaffna to break him out of prison. That day the group made up of S.V.A.Piyathilaka, Lionel Bopage, [[Jayadeva Uyangoda]], Sunanda Deshpriya, [[Athula Nimalasiri Jayasinghe|Loku Athula]], W.T. Karunarathne, Susi L. Wickrama, Wijesena Vidanage alias Sanath, Somasiri Kumanayake, and Anura Ranjith Kurukulasooriya decided that all [[police station]]s in the country would be attacked on the night of 5 April at 11:00&nbsp;pm. Since the JVP had considered that local police stations were the governments principle element of power locally. They hoped to remove this presence of power and see the local populaces raise up in their support bring about a revolution. The district leader for Monaragala and Wellawaya was not present at the meeting, the decision to attack was conwayed to them via a telegram that read ''\"JVP Appuhamy expired. Funeral 5.\"'''. The Wellawaya leader took the order to attack on the morning of 5 April, and not the evening as had been agreed at the meeting.<ref name=\"retrospect\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=41 Years After 1971 JVP: Where Have The Decision Makers Gone? |url=https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/41-years-after-1971-jvp-where-have-the-decision-makers-gone/ |accessdate=26 March 2020 |agency=Colombotelegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Insurrection==\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n===JVP plan of attack===\nIt was discussed and agreed on 2 April, a countrywide insurrection would be launched on 5 April evening. Four important missions were planned and assigned. Major responsibly of these attacks were entrusted to the student wing, which  Wijeweera had once called the \"the Red Guard\". The first of four important missions, was the attack on the [[Panagoda Cantonment]], which was one of the largest military installations in the country and housed a large [[arsenal]]. Piyasiri was incharge of this attack with 800 students, divided into groups of twenty five each assigned to the task. A smaller attack was to be stage on [[SLAF Katunayake|RCyAF Katunayake]]. The second mission was to abduct the Prime Minister. Attack was to be lead by Nimal, [[Somawansa Amarasinghe]], Sanath Kumar and Lal Pieries with over 50 students. Third mission was the capture of the city of Colombo under Bopage. Colombo was devided into five areas, Colombo South, Colombo North, Kandy Road, Colombo Central, and Kotte. The carders were to attack police stations along the way gaining arms and ammunition from these. Key targets were, [[Welikada Prison]], [[Srawasthi Mandiraya|Srawasthi]], [[Radio Ceylon]] and several residences of government officials such as Justice Minister, [[Felix Dias Bandaranaike]]; [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Army Commander]] and the [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|IGP]]. The forth mission was rescue Wijeweera from prison in Jaffna.<ref name=\"Alles\"/><ref name=\"Gunarathna\">{{cite book |last1=Gunarathna |first1=Rohan |title=Sri Lanka: A lost Revolution, The Inside Story of the JVP |date=1990 |publisher=Institute of Fundamental Studies |location=Sri Lanka |isbn=9552600049 }}</ref>           \n\n===The Wellawaya attack===\nThe planning for the countrywide insurrection was hasty and poorly coordinated; some of the district leaders were not informed until the morning of the uprising.  At dawn (5.20 am) on 5 April 1971 the [[Wellawaya]] police station came under attack with two police constables were killed. The Wellawaya attack had preempted the initial wave of simultaneous  attacks planned by the JVP. They lost the key element of surprise. Following news from the attack in Wellawaya, an alerted government began frantic preparations to face further attacks. A curfew was declared and all police stations were warned of an impending attack, the armed forces began to mobilize by [[Major General]] [[D. S. Attygalle]], [[Commander of the Army (Sri Lanka)|Commander of the Ceylon Army]]. After dawn on 5 April, General Attygalle ordered army units of the [[Gemunu Watch]] from [[Diyatalawa]] to Wellawaya, where the initial attack had taken place.<ref name=\"Alles\"/><ref name=\"Gunarathna\"/> \n\nSeveral JVP cardres were arrested by the police at [[Viharamahadevi Park]] on 5 April as they prepared to abduct or assassinate the Prime Minister at her private residence in Rosemead place. This was follows by more arrests in Kotahena and Borella. At 8 PM, Major General Attygalle, IGP [[Stanley Senanayake]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Anuruddha Ratwatte arrived at the Prime Minister's private residence and briefed her on the attack at Wellawaya and impending attack that night. Soon after, Prime Minister left to [[Prime Minister's House (Colombo)|Temple Trees]] Prime Minister's official residence accompanied by General Attygalle, Captain Wijeratne and her normal escort. Thereafter Temple Trees became the nerve center for government operations during the crisis and had its security strengthened. It also became a refuge for ministers most of whom were from leftist parties. Helicopter patrols around the capital began as rumors started that the JVP was marching on Colombo. \n\n===Initial wave of attacks===\nWith a curfew was imposed and suspects being arrested some of the JVP leaders went into hiding. However the attack commenced as planned 92 police stations across the country were attacked simultaneously by JVP groups armed with shotguns, bombs and Molotov and five, [[Deniyaya]], [[Uragaha]], [[Rajangane]], [[Kataragama]] and [[Warakapola Divisional Secretariat|Warakapola]] overrun by the insurgents and 43 abandoned by the police for \"strategic reasons\" in the days that followed. Fifty-seven police stations were damaged. The insurgents cut telephone and power lines, blocked roads with trees. The Hanwella police station close to Colombo came under attack on the 6 April and was beaten off with army reinforcements from the Panagoda Cantonment. The No. 4 Squadron of the Royal Ceylon Air Force deployed its three [[Bell 206A JetRanger]] helicopters, which began flying missions to remote police stations to supply the stations with weapons and ammunition. In the following days, the helicopters returned wounded to hospitals. [[RCyAF Ekala]] also came under attack. The police withdrew its personnel from smaller police stations. By 10 April the rebels had taken control of Matara District and the city of Ambalangoda in Galle District, and came close to capturing the remaining areas of Southern Province with exception of [[Galle]] and [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] which had two old Dutch colonial forts and small army garrisons.\n\n===The government's response===\nThe government forces responded with first securing the capital Colombo; other cities and large towns with sizable police and military garrisons. A road blocks were set up, and bridges, ports, and airports were secured, overstretching the small armed forces which had stared mobilizing its [[reservist]]s. Army, navy and air force personnel were deployed on ground duty in a defensive posture at first. In most areas, the police were able to hold out interdependently. Within the first few days the government felt the situation was dire since it was found that its small arms ammunition would run out in a week and fears of infiltration of the armed forces by the JVP members appeared when a navy rating shot fellow ratings in Jaffna. \n\nDuring this time, the JVP took advantage of the weakness of the armed forces and police by capturing large areas of the country uncontested. Many army convoys were ambushed and several initial offensives were pushed back in areas like [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]], where the local [[Member of Parliament (Sri Lanka)|member of parliament]], Sumanapala Dahanayake, was wounded accompanying the first joint army and police expedition into rebel held areas in Matara.  \n\nFormer [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]] (IGP) [[S.A. Dissanayake]] was appointed Additional Permanent Secretary of the [[Ministry of External Affairs and Defence]] and coordinated the government's defence activities from the situation room at Temple Trees. \n\n===International assistance===\nDesperately short of weapons and ammunition, Bandaranaike issued a distress call to friendly countries for support via [[telegram]]. The response from many governments were swift. The United Kingdom was the first respond positively, and allowed the Ceylonese government use an [[Air Ceylon]] [[Trident]] to ferry small arms and ammunition from its bases in [[Singpore]]. Pakistan responded with airlifting supplies, troops and helicopters to [[Ratmalana Airport]] and took over its defence releasing Ceylonese troops for other duties. India did not properly receive the cable and the Indian High Commissioner in Ceylon was sent back to his country carrying the message for aid from the Government of Ceylon on 13 April. Units from the [[Southern Command (India)|Indian Army Southern Command]] were airlifted from [[Bangalore]] and [[Madras]] (Chennai), to [[RCyAF Katunayake]] and five Chetak helicopters 104 Helicopter Squadron followed with more arms and ammunition. 104 Helicopter Squadron logged 573 flying hours spread across as many as 1122 sorties in Ceylon. 150 [[Indian Gorkha]]s took over the guarding RCyAF Katunayake and the [[Indian Navy]] deployed four frigates setting up a naval cordon around Ceylon since the Royal Ceylon Navy had deployed its sailors on ground operations and harbor defence, latter was later taken over by Indian and Pakistani troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vayu-sena.indianmilitaryhistory.org/other-coin-1971-ceylon.shtml|title=COIN operations in Ceylon - 1971 - Vayu Sena|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[RAF]] heavy transports flew in six Bell 47-G2 helicopters on 17 April, and also ammunition purchased from Singapore. The government also received aid from the Soviet Union, with it flying in five [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]]F fighter bombers, a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15 UTI]] trainer, as well as two [[Kamov Ka-26]] helicopters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=61809|title=The Island|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Soviet Union also sent 12 light mortars, [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] supplied 4 [[76 mm mountain gun M48|76 mm mountain guns]] and China supplied 30 [[85 mm anti-tank gun D-48|85 mm Type 60 anti-tank guns]]. The Soviet Union donated 10 [[BTR-152]]s, while Ceylon bought 18 [[Ferret armoured car]]s from the UK and received several [[Alvis Saladin]]s. China supplied 30,000 automatic and semi-automatic rifles and Australia provided 5,000 semi-automatic rifles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wickremesekera |first1=Channa |title=The Tamil Separatist War in Sri Lanka |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317293859 }}</ref>\n\n===Crackdown===\nWithin days of the start of the insurrection, the armed forces began offensive operations after the initial wave of attacks had withered away. Personnel from all three armed services deployed for offensive operations with mobilization of reservists, most of whom were World War II veterans, and with regular troops freed from guard duty as Pakistani and Indian troops took up defense of many key installations. Local coordinating officers from the three branches of the armed forces were appointed to carry out local [[counter-insurgency]] operations in districts. The RCyAF, took out of storage five [[BAC Jet Provost|Hunting Jet Provosts]] which had been mothballed in 1970, serviced and armed them in three days and flew them from [[RCyAF Chinabay]] to RCyAF Katunayake attacking rebel locations en route. Several weeks later the Jet Provosts were joined by the Bell 47-G2 in ground attack missions.\n\nAfter three weeks of fighting, the government regained control of all but a few remote areas. The government offered amnesties in May and June 1971; captured and surrounded rebels were detained in rehabilitation camps for months until they were released, numbering 20,000.\n\n==<small>Casualties</small>==\nThe official death toll was 1200, but unofficial figures reliably estimated it to be around 4000\u20135000. 41 civilians were killed by the insurgents. 37 police officers were killed and 195 wounded. 26 armed services personnel were killed (19 army, 4 air force and 3 navy) and 130 were wounded (87 army, 15 air force and 28 navy) from 1971 to 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/010408/spec.html|title=The Sunday Times - Special Assignment|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Prosecution of insurgents==\nThe Prime Minister appointed an Investigation Unit headed by retired IGP [[Aleric Abeygunawardena]] to carryout the investigations to prosecute the captured insurgents. The unit was made up of crown counsels and police officers. The crown counsels seconded to it from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department were granted the rank of [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]], in order to take statements of suspects which would be admissible in court. It soon became apparent that it would take years to convict the large number of suspects in custody within the normal procedure and laws of the day.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Wickramanayake:  Well known, powerful personality |url=http://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/04/29/fea40.asp |accessdate=11 April 2020 |publisher=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal Justice Commission===\n{{main|Criminal Justice Commission (Sri Lanka)}}\nThe [[Criminal Justice Commission (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Justice Commission]] was thus established by the government to prosecute the detained rebels in a expedient manner. It was composed of Chief Justice H N G Fernando (Chairman), Justice [[A. C. Alles]], Justice V T Thamotheram, Justice H Dheragoda and Justice [[T. W. Rajaratnam]]. In 1975 Wijeweera was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment later amended to 20 years rigorous imprisonment. Many of the surviving leaders of the JVP received prison sentences. Most of the youth in rehabilitation camps were released.\n\n==Legacy==\nCeylon severed diplomatic ties with [[North Korea]] in 1971 based on allegations that it supported the JVP, diplomatic relations have not been reestablished since then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=15332|title=The Island|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> Under the six years of emergency rule that followed the uprising, the JVP remained dormant. After the victory of the United National Party in the 1977 elections, however, the new government attempted to broaden its mandate with a period of political tolerance. Wijeweera was freed, the ban on the party was lifted and the JVP entered the arena of legal political competition. As a candidate in the 1982 presidential elections, Wijeweera finished fourth, with more than 250,000 votes (as compared with Jayewardene's 3.2 million). By the late the 1980s the JVP had started a [[1987\u201389 JVP Insurrection|second insurrection]] lasting from 1987 to 1989. This was more of a [[low intensity conflict]] than an open revolution as the first insurrection in 1971.\n\n==Investigations into the causes==\nThere are two categories of casual factors. The first is structural: educated unemployment. With rapid population increase and relatively slow economic growth left most youth, who were the beneficiaries of free education, unemployed or engaged in jobs which did not meet their expectation. The unemployment rate was too high when compared to the output of the education system, which the labour market failed to absorb. The second signifying factor is a sequence of political factors: President [[J. R. Jayewardene|Jayawardena]]\u2019s political strategy of oppressing the opposition; the weakness induced in the main opposition party ([[Sri Lanka Freedom Party|SLFP]]); the subtle exclusion of those who lack political connections from access to state patronage; the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord|Indo-Sri Lankan Peace Accord]] and the entry of Indian troops to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Mick|date=July 1993|title=Thoroughly Modern Revolutionaries: The JVP in Sri Lanka|journal=Modern Asian Studies|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=593\u2013642|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00010908|issn=1469-8099}}</ref>\n\n==People involved==\n\n===Notable people killed===\n* [[Lt.
