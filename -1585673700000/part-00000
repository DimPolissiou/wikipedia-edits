So we decided to make a brand new version, where we could update the graphics, play around with powers, create new environments, etc.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/17/3886708/making-temple-run-2 | title=Making lightning strike twice with 'Temple Run 2' | work=The Verge|last=Webster|first=Andrew|date=January 17, 2013 | accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Temple Run 2'' was announced in a surprise announcement by Imangi Studios on January 16, 2013, with the game being released in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in [[New Zealand]] immediately, and an international release coming a few hours later.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3882182/temple-run-2-launching-tonight| title='Temple Run 2' launching on iPhone and iPad tonight| work=The Verge|last=Webster|first=Andrew| date=January 16, 2013|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>  The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was released on January 24, 2013.<ref name=\"Nextweb\" /> The [[Windows Phone 8]] version was released on December 20, 2013 with the inclusion of [[Xbox Live]] achievements.

Guillory wrote that Brown acts as [[stewardess]] by guiding a man to examine different parts of her body, like her breasts and dark skin, while boasting she tastes \"just like candy\".

In a 2012 article for [[The Boombox|''The Boombox'']], Nadine Graham said the song was \"sugary sweet, poppy cut\".{{sfn|Graham|2012}} ''HipHopDX''{{'}}s Dana Scott named ''Broken Silence'' one of the top twenty best albums by a female rapper, citing \"Candy\" as a \"pop-worthy [[earworm]]\" that helped to \"to lighten up the showcase\".{{Sfn|Scott|2019}} [[Fuse (TV channel)|''Fuse'']]{{'}}s Jeff Benjamin included the song on his 2014 [[Spotify]] playlist of the best female collaborations.{{sfn|Benjamin|2014}} Praising \"Candy\" as one of Kelis' top ten collaborations in a 2017 article for ''[[The Fader]]'', Patrick D.

According to scholar Doyinsola Faluyi, Brown's appearance on the song's cover represents how some black female rappers focused on their sexuality. This was in contrast to artists like [[Da Brat]] who modeled themselves after \"the dominant fashion in male hip-hop culture\" with a more masculine style.{{sfn|Faluyi|2015|p=447}} The lyrics were discussed by Jennifer Esposito and Bettina Love who believed Brown's boasts about being the dominant partner during sex combated psychologist [[Michelle Fine]]'s theories on \"sexuality as victimization\". Brown's explicit demands for oral sex throughout the song serves to challenge negative cultural attitudes about sexually active women \"mak[ing] it clear that women can desire sex and can ask for pleasure\".{{sfn|Esposito|Love|2008|pp=43-44}}\n\nNichole A. Guillory criticized \"Candy\" as a [[sexual fantasy]] that [[Sexual objectification|objectifies]] a black woman's body to appeal to a [[male gaze]], writing that its lyrics present black women as \"territories to be penetrated, occupied and ravaged by men\". Guillory noted Brown demonstrates some agency when she brags about being priceless and skilled as a top. Although she felt this moment was not strong enough to undo the overall objectification present in the lyrics, she acknowledged it as \"an important reminder of the ongoing struggle between black women and men for control of black women's bodies\".{{sfn|Guillory|2009}} In another critical analysis of the song, Esposito and Love questioned if Brown was promoting further the idea that \"bad girls are used sexually by men, while good girls are the ones men want to marry\".{{sfn|Esposito|Love|2008|pp=43-44}}\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Candy\" debuted at number 24 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] on September 15, 2001.{{sfn|''Billboard'' a}} It also peaked at number 48 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] ''Billboard'' chart and number 10 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] ''Billboard'' chart in September 2001.{{sfn|''Billboard'' b}}{{sfn|''Billboard'' c}} While discussing the song's commercial performance, ''The Boombox's'' Nadine Graham said it was hated by \"the streets\" and it had \"struggled its way up\" the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.{{sfn|Graham|2012}}\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 12\" single{{sfn|WorldCat}}\n| title1 = Candy\n| note1 = radio edit\n| length1 = 3:45\n| title2 = Candy\n| note2 = LP version\n| length2 = 3:43\n| title3 = Candy\n| note3 = instrumental\n| length3 = 3:43\n| title4 = 730\n| note4 = radio edit\n| length4 = 4:00\n| title5 = 730\n| note5 = LP version\n| length5 = 4:12\n| title6 = 730\n| note6 = instrumental\n| length6 = 4:11\n}}\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of ''Broken Silence''.{{Sfn|''Broken Silence''|2001}}\n\n'''Recording locations'''\n* Master Sound Recording Studios (Virginia Beach)\n* Avatar Studios (New York City)\n\n'''Personnel'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Featuring&nbsp;\u2013 Kelis\n* Mixing&nbsp;\u2013 Axel Niehaus\n* Producer&nbsp;\u2013 The Neptunes\n{{col-2}}\n* Recording&nbsp;\u2013 David Hummel\n* Vocal recording&nbsp;\u2013 Erik Steinert\n* Composition&nbsp;\u2013 C.

In a 2012 article for [[The Boombox|''The Boombox'']], Nadine Graham said the song was \"sugary sweet, poppy cut\".{{sfn|Graham|2012}} ''HipHopDX''{{'}}s Dana Scott named ''Broken Silence'' one of the top twenty best albums by a female rapper, citing \"Candy\" as a \"pop-worthy [[earworm]]\" that helped to \"to lighten up the showcase\".{{Sfn|Scott|2019}} [[Fuse (TV channel)|''Fuse'']]{{'}}s Jeff Benjamin included the song on his 2014 [[Spotify]] playlist of the best female collaborations.{{sfn|Benjamin|2014}} Praising \"Candy\" as one of Kelis' top ten collaborations in a 2017 article for ''[[The Fader]]'', Patrick D.

According to scholar Doyinsola Faluyi, Brown's appearance on the song's cover represents how some black female rappers focused on their sexuality. This was in contrast to artists like [[Da Brat]] who modeled themselves after \"the dominant fashion in male hip-hop culture\" with a more masculine style.{{sfn|Faluyi|2015|p=447}} The lyrics were discussed by Jennifer Esposito and Bettina Love who believed Brown's boasts about being the dominant partner during sex combated psychologist [[Michelle Fine]]'s theories on \"sexuality as victimization\". Brown's explicit demands for oral sex throughout the song serves to challenge negative cultural attitudes about sexually active women \"mak[ing] it clear that women can desire sex and can ask for pleasure\".{{sfn|Esposito|Love|2008|pp=43-44}}\n\nNichole A. Guillory criticized \"Candy\" as a [[sexual fantasy]] that [[Sexual objectification|objectifies]] a black woman's body to appeal to a [[male gaze]], writing that its lyrics present black women as \"territories to be penetrated, occupied and ravaged by men\". Guillory noted Brown demonstrates some agency when she brags about being priceless and skilled as a top. Although she felt this moment was not strong enough to undo the overall objectification present in the lyrics, she acknowledged it as \"an important reminder of the ongoing struggle between black women and men for control of black women's bodies\".{{sfn|Guillory|2009}} In another critical analysis of the song, Esposito and Love questioned if Brown was promoting further the idea that \"bad girls are used sexually by men, while good girls are the ones men want to marry\".{{sfn|Esposito|Love|2008|pp=43-44}}\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n\"Candy\" debuted at number 24 on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]] [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] on September 15, 2001.{{sfn|''Billboard'' a}} It also peaked at number 48 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] ''Billboard'' chart and number 10 on the [[Hot Rap Songs]] ''Billboard'' chart in September 2001.{{sfn|''Billboard'' b}}{{sfn|''Billboard'' c}} While discussing the song's commercial performance, ''The Boombox's'' Nadine Graham said it was hated by \"the streets\" and it had \"struggled its way up\" the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.{{sfn|Graham|2012}}\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = 12\" single{{sfn|WorldCat}}\n| title1 = Candy\n| note1 = radio edit\n| length1 = 3:45\n| title2 = Candy\n| note2 = LP version\n| length2 = 3:43\n| title3 = Candy\n| note3 = instrumental\n| length3 = 3:43\n| title4 = 730\n| note4 = radio edit\n| length4 = 4:00\n| title5 = 730\n| note5 = LP version\n| length5 = 4:12\n| title6 = 730\n| note6 = instrumental\n| length6 = 4:11\n}}\n\n== Credits and personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of ''Broken Silence''.{{Sfn|''Broken Silence''|2001}}\n\n'''Recording locations'''\n* Master Sound Recording Studios (Virginia Beach)\n* Avatar Studios (New York City)\n\n'''Personnel'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Featuring&nbsp;\u2013 Kelis\n* Mixing&nbsp;\u2013 Axel Niehaus\n* Producer&nbsp;\u2013 The Neptunes\n{{col-2}}\n* Recording&nbsp;\u2013 David Hummel\n* Vocal recording&nbsp;\u2013 Erik Steinert\n* Composition&nbsp;\u2013 C.

The shell has a rounded [[carina (anatomy)|carina]] and a convex ventral side.  \n\nThe quagga mussel resembles the [[zebra mussel]], just as its namesake ([[quagga]]) resembles the [[zebra]]. The quagga mussel shell can be distinguished from the zebra mussel shell because it is paler toward the end of the [[Ligament_(bivalve)|hinge]]. It is also slightly larger than the zebra mussel, about {{convert|20|mm|in|1}} wide, roughly about the size of an adult human's thumbnail. \n\n[[Image:Quagga mussels GLERL 1.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Quagga mussels in [[Lake Michigan]] sediment sample]]\n\n==Diet==\nThe quagga mussel is a [[filter feeder]]. It uses its [[cilia]] to pull water into its shell cavity through an incurrent siphon and it is here that desirable particulate matter is removed. Each adult mussel is capable of filtering one or more liters of water each day, where they remove [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], [[algae]], and even their own [[veliger]]s.

''Dreissena'' are [[dioecious]] (either male or female) with external fertilization. A fully mature female mussel is capable of producing up to one million eggs per year. After fertilization, pelagic microscopic larvae, or veligers, develop within a few days and these veligers soon acquire minute bivalve shells. Free-swimming veligers drift with the currents for three to four weeks feeding by their hair-like cilia while trying to locate suitable substrata to settle and secure [[byssal thread]]s. Mortality in this transitional stage from planktonic veliger to settled juveniles may exceed 99%.<ref name=\"usgs\">{{cite web |url=http://cars.er.usgs.gov/Nonindigenous_Species/Zebra_mussel_FAQs/Dreissena_FAQs/dreissena_faqs.html |title=Dreissena FAQs |work=Florida Integrated Science Center - Gainesville |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |first=Myriah |last=Richerson |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Invasive species==\n[[Zebra mussel]]s, the first dreissenid mussel introduced in North America, rapidly spread throughout many major river systems and the [[Great Lakes]], causing substantial ecological and environmental impacts. The quagga mussel was first observed in North America in September 1989 when it was discovered in [[Lake Erie]] near [[Port Colborne, Ontario]]. It was not identified as a distinct species until 1991. \n\nThe introduction of both dreissenid species into the Great Lakes appears to be the result of [[Ballast water regulation in the United States|ballast water discharge]] from transoceanic ships that were carrying veligers, juveniles, or adult mussels. The genus ''Dreissena'' is highly polymorphic and prolific with high potential for rapid adaptation attributing to its rapid expansion and colonization. Still, there are other factors that can aid in the spread of these species across North American waters, such as, larval drift in river systems or fishing and boating activities that allow for overland transport or movement between water basins. The success of overland transport of ''Dreissena'' species depends on their ability to tolerate periods of desiccation, and results suggest that, given temperate summer conditions, adult ''Dreissena'' may survive 3-5 days of aerial exposure.<ref name=\"usgs\"/>\n\nQuaggas are prodigious water filterers, removing substantial amounts of [[phytoplankton]] and suspended particulate from the water. By removing the phytoplankton, quaggas in turn decrease the food source for [[zooplankton]], therefore altering the food web. Impacts associated with the filtration of water include increases in water transparency, decreases in mean [[chlorophyll]] concentrations, and accumulation of pseudofeces. Water clarity increases light penetration causing a proliferation of aquatic plants that can change species dominance and alter the entire ecosystems. The pseudofeces that is produced from filtering the water accumulates and impacts the environment. As the waste particles decompose, oxygen is used up, water acidity increases (decreased [[pH]]) and toxic byproducts are produced. In addition, quagga mussels accumulate organic pollutants within their tissues to levels more than 300,000 times greater than concentrations in the environment and these pollutants are found in their pseudofeces, which can be passed up the food chain, therefore increasing wildlife exposure to organic pollutants (Snyder et al., 1997). Another major threat involves the fouling of native freshwater mussels. Since quaggas were discovered in [[Lake Michigan]] in 1998, plankton rings formed by the passage of storms have been eaten away by the quagga mussels, threatening the local ecosystem.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leontiou |first=Andrea|title=Destruction of Giant Algae Doughnut Threatens Lake Michigan |url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/algae-munching-mussels-could-destroy-lake-michigan-ecosystem-100907.html |work=Imaginova Corporation |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach coin-sized quagga can filter up to a liter of water per day, stripping away the plankton that for thousands of years directly and indirectly sustained the native fish.  Much of that food supply has now been sucked to the lake bottom; for every pound of prey fish swimming in the lake today, there are an estimated three or four pounds of quaggas clustering on the lake bed.<ref name=js2>[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/127610953.html jsonline.com: 'The lake left me. It's gone.'] 13 Aug 2011</ref>\n\n[[Image:Quagga Map lg.jpg|thumb|Map showing distribution of quagga mussels in the U.S.]]\n''Dreissena'''s ability to rapidly colonize hard surfaces causes serious economic problems. These major [[biofouling]] organisms can clog water intake structures, such as pipes and screens, therefore reducing pumping capabilities for power and [[water treatment]] plants, costing industries, companies, and communities. Recreation-based industries and activities have also been impacted; [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, [[breakwall]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[boat]]s, and [[beach]]es have all been heavily colonized. Many of the potential impacts of ''Dreissena'' are unclear due to the limited time scale of North American colonization. Nonetheless, it is clear that the genus ''Dreissena'' is highly polymorphic and has a high potential for rapid adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, possibly leading to significant long-term impacts on North American waters. Also, the colonization of deeper water by ''D. r. bugensis'', exposes the quagga to a new range of environmental conditions and new habitats.\n\nIt causes many of the same problems (stripping life-supporting algae,<ref name=sc2011>{{cite news | title=Invasive mussels causing massive ecological change in Great Lake | work=ScienceDaily | publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC | date=17 April 2011 }}</ref> damaging boats, power plants, and harbors and destroying the native mussel population) as the equally invasive zebra mussel of [[Russia]]. It is also displacing native burrowing [[amphipod]] (''Diporeia hoyi'') from the deep waters of Lake Erie.\n\nIn January 2007, quagga mussels were discovered at a marina in the Nevada portion of [[Lake Mead]], and two other lakes on the [[Colorado River]], [[Lake Mohave]] and [[Lake Havasu]].<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0123water-mussels0123.html The Arizona Republic, Jan. 23, 2007 - Mussels invading Arizona waterways, by Shaun McKinnon]</ref>\n\nIn 2008 the threat of quagga mussels being introduced at [[Lake Casitas]] and Westlake Lake in California from recreational boating resulted in the lakes banning the use of outside boats.<ref>[http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/mar/07/westlake-lake-joins-casitas-in-boat-ban-linked/ Westlake Lake joins Casitas in boat ban linked to mussel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310190612/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2008/mar/07/westlake-lake-joins-casitas-in-boat-ban-linked/ |date=March 10, 2008 }}.</ref> As of March 2008, other lakes such as Castaic and Lake Cachuma are considering similar bans.

As the waste particles decompose, oxygen is used up, water acidity increases (decreased [[pH]]) and toxic byproducts are produced. In addition, quagga mussels accumulate organic pollutants within their tissues to levels more than 300,000 times greater than concentrations in the environment and these pollutants are found in their pseudofeces, which can be passed up the food chain, therefore increasing wildlife exposure to organic pollutants (Snyder et al., 1997). Another major threat involves the fouling of native freshwater mussels. Since quaggas were discovered in [[Lake Michigan]] in 1998, plankton rings formed by the passage of storms have been eaten away by the quagga mussels, threatening the local ecosystem.<ref>{{cite web |last=Leontiou |first=Andrea|title=Destruction of Giant Algae Doughnut Threatens Lake Michigan |url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/algae-munching-mussels-could-destroy-lake-michigan-ecosystem-100907.html |work=Imaginova Corporation |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach coin-sized quagga can filter up to a liter of water per day, stripping away the plankton that for thousands of years directly and indirectly sustained the native fish.  Much of that food supply has now been sucked to the lake bottom; for every pound of prey fish swimming in the lake today, there are an estimated three or four pounds of quaggas clustering on the lake bed.<ref name=js2>[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/127610953.html jsonline.com: 'The lake left me.

These major [[biofouling]] organisms can clog water intake structures, such as pipes and screens, therefore reducing pumping capabilities for power and [[water treatment]] plants, costing industries, companies, and communities. Recreation-based industries and activities have also been impacted; [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, [[breakwall]]s, [[buoy]]s, [[boat]]s, and [[beach]]es have all been heavily colonized. Many of the potential impacts of ''Dreissena'' are unclear due to the limited time scale of North American colonization. Nonetheless, it is clear that the genus ''Dreissena'' is highly polymorphic and has a high potential for rapid adaptation to extreme environmental conditions, possibly leading to significant long-term impacts on North American waters. Also, the colonization of deeper water by ''D. r. bugensis'', exposes the quagga to a new range of environmental conditions and new habitats.\n\nIt causes many of the same problems (stripping life-supporting algae,<ref name=sc2011>{{cite news | title=Invasive mussels causing massive ecological change in Great Lake | work=ScienceDaily | publisher=ScienceDaily, LLC | date=17 April 2011 }}</ref> damaging boats, power plants, and harbors and destroying the native mussel population) as the equally invasive zebra mussel of [[Russia]].

She is played by actress [[Marcia Cross]], who has received multiple awards and nominations for her portrayal, including an [[Emmy Award]] nomination, three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, and two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. Cross' portrayal of Bree has been widely praised by critics and fans.\n\nCross originally auditioned for the role of [[Mary Alice Young]], but series creator Marc Cherry thought she was better suited for the role of Bree. [[Dana Delany]], who eventually was cast as [[Katherine Mayfair]], was originally chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=James Brady|title=In Step With...Dana Delany|date=2008-04-27|publisher=Parade Magazine|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_04-27-2008/In_Step_With...Dana_Delany|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530205941/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_04-27-2008/In_Step_With...Dana_Delany|archivedate=2008-05-30}}</ref>\n\nBree's main struggle throughout the series has been her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She has been married three times; to [[Rex Van de Kamp]] ([[Steven Culp]]), [[Orson Hodge]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), and [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Trip Weston|Trip Weston]] ([[Scott Bakula]]).\n\n==Character profile==\nBree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in ''Desperate Housewives''. Bree grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her stepmother's demands, Bree left for [[Lake Forest College]] near [[Chicago]]. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she ever was given from her step-mother. Bree met [[Rex Van de Kamp]] at a meeting of the [[Young Republicans]]. After they graduated, they married and had two children, [[Andrew Van de Kamp|Andrew]] and [[Danielle Van de Kamp|Danielle]], and moved to [[Wisteria Lane|Fairview]].\n\nBree is very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] Americans; she has been called a \"hyper-uptight WASP.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul D. Sweeney|author2=Dean B. McFarlin|title=International Management: Strategic Opportunities and Cultural Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYCQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA200|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=200}}</ref> Bree is recognized for her perfectionist attitude and work ethic, which at times border on [[neurosis]] and [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. While the writers have shied away from an official diagnosis, the character is recognized as suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]]. The character herself refers to her \"quirks\" in terms of [[anal retentiveness]] but Rex once mentioned it by the name. Bree's perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit and run: a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better.\n\nBree is known for her homemaking talents on the level of [[Martha Stewart]], particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats and pineapple bran [[muffin]]s. She is also well versed in firearms; she owns four guns and is a card-carrying member of the [[National Rifle Association]]. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and is also known for being a member of the local [[Presbyterian]] church, as shown in the episode ''[[Sunday (Desperate Housewives)|Sunday]]''. Her neighbors [[Angie Bolen]], [[Gabrielle Solis]] and [[Renee Perry]] have nicknamed her '[[Nancy Reagan]]' on occasions.\n\nShe has lived at 4354 [[Wisteria Lane]] in Fairview since 1994 and is also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses.\nBree is based on creator [[Marc Cherry]]'s own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while [[Lynette Scavo]]'s family is based on Marc Cherry's childhood years.<ref name=\"hamptonroads\">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/147651|title=Mother of ''Desperate Housewives'' creator featured in season two extras|date=September 1, 2006|publisher=The Virginian Pilot|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref> Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of [[Marc Cherry]]'s previous failed sitcoms, ''[[The 5 Mrs. Buchanans]]'' (Bree) and ''[[The Crew (TV series)|The Crew]]'' (Rex).\n\nBoth of Bree's marriages have broken down and ended in divorce (Rex, however, died before their divorce was finalized). Following the request for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband [[Orson Hodge]] did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with [[Karl Mayer]], her divorce lawyer and ex-husband of her friend, [[Susan Delfino]]. Bree, however, did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband.\n\nBree is the only one of the main four housewives not to appear in every episode. Appearing only as a [[stand-in]] in \"[[My Husband, The Pig]]\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\"[[Dress Big]]\", \"[[Liaisons (Desperate Housewives)|Liaisons]]\", \"[[God, That's Good]]\", \"[[Gossip (Desperate Housewives)|Gossip]]\", \"[[Into the Woods (Desperate Housewives)|Into the Woods]]\" and \"[[What Would We Do Without You?]]\") due to Cross' pregnancy.\n\n==Overview==\n===Past===\nBree Mason was born in the year 1962. When she was 10 years old, her mother taught her a lesson about \"masking\" so she could hide true feelings and emotions, which prevented her from being able to be hurt by men. Shortly after, during [[Christmas]] 1972, her mother died in hospital after a car accident. Bree stayed at home and cleaned her mother's blood from the driveway. She felt relieved after that. Her father then married Eleanor. Bree had to earn respect from her stepmother and so worked very hard. Eleanor said to her stepdaughter that she was very lucky and possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight: weapons all women needed to survive in the world. Her dad took care of his daughter and tried to raise her to be a classic lady.\n\nShe got engaged to her boyfirend, Ty Grant, but met Rex Van de Kamp and the two fell in love during college. Bree and Rex got married in 1987. Bree gave birth to her son Andrew in 1988 and daughter Danielle in 1989. The family moved to 4354 Wisteria Lane, Fairview and she gave a bad first impression to Mary Alice Young and Susan Mayer, after Andrew stole a ceramic frog from the Youngs' backyard. Bree, Susan and Mary Alice become close friends and in 1998 Lynette Scavo joined the group. 5 years later, after a short and difficult first impression of Gabrielle Solis, all four women accepted the ex-model as their friend.\n\n===Season 1===\nBree Van de Kamp is introduced as the \"perfect\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearances makes her family resent her, and as her husband Rex put it \"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore\".\n\nShe insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counseling when he wants a divorce, and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]], leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \"persuaded\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, [[George Williams (Desperate Housewives)|George Williams]], but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in [[Sadism and masochism|S&M]] scenarios with him.\n\nConcerned about Andrew's worsening behavior, she is cheered when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately this doesn't make any difference so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is gay. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counseling on lifestyle, believing that his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn Season 2, Bree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She so annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief that Bree tells her that she cannot attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers Phyllis reported her friendship with George to the company handling Rex's life insurance. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the local paper, an ex-fianc\u00e9e of his visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends the woman away but she is proved right when George loses his temper with an old school friend of Bree's, so she ends their relationship. He tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund.\n \nEvents with Rex, George and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins AA but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter, and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbors, the Applewhites are hiding from the police and is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund. She dumps Peter and throws Andrew out after discovering that they slept together and in her bed.\n\nBree's mental health deteriorates rapidly following this and nobody can help her as her behavior becomes erratic and spirals out of control including creating a scene at Danielle's birthday party. Danielle, meanwhile, starts dating [[Matthew Applewhite]] and moves out to be with him. However, Matthew's mother, [[Betty Applewhite]], realizes Matthew murdered an ex-girlfriend, Melanie Foster. She tells Bree, who has checked herself into a psychiatric unit and later escapes after they refuse to let her leave. Bree and Betty rush to Bree's house to find Matthew and Danielle have taken money from Bree's safe. Bree confronts Matthew about Melanie and refuses to let them leave, so he threatens to shoot her, but the police, called by Betty, shoot him first. Bree then has to console Danielle. Bree's final scenes involve her beginning a new friendship with the mysterious [[Orson Hodge]].\n\n===Season 3===\nSeason three sees Bree marrying Orson after a six-month relationship, but their marriage is troubled by the belief that Orson physically abused his first wife, [[Alma Hodge|Alma]] ([[Valerie Mahaffey]]), and murdered her. Shortly after the wedding, Orson persuades Andrew to come home and they reconcile.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Orson's mother, [[Gloria Hodge|Gloria]] ([[Dixie Carter]]), and Alma's return, cause more trouble. They drug and rape Orson but Bree intervenes, learning that Gloria murdered Orson's mistress, Monique Polier, so he would stay with Alma. Gloria tries to kill Bree but Orson intervenes. Gloria has a severe stroke after Orson holds her head under water to get her to let go of the knife about to be used to kill Bree. Orson carries Gloria's body outside and places it next to Alma's body after  she died when falling from the roof of her house.\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, finds herself pregnant by Edie's nephew Austin ([[Josh Henderson]]). She is sent away so the neighborhood won't learn of her pregnancy and Bree and Orson decide to fake a pregnancy so they can raise Danielle's child as their own.\n\nBree is not in episodes 3.16 to 3.22 as she is on honeymoon with Orson and Danielle. Bree returns for Gabrielle and Victor's wedding, heavily pregnant or so it seems...\n\n===Season 4===\nIn season four, Bree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant but is dismayed by people wanting to feel the baby move. Phyllis, Rex\u2019s mother, discovers Bree\u2019s pregnancy hoax and tries convincing Danielle to raise the child herself. Bree and Orson, however, persuade Danielle to give them the baby by offering to send her to college and buy her a convertible. Danielle has a baby boy and gives him to Bree \u2014 who names him Benjamin Tyson Hodge (surname later changed to Katz) \u2014 and agrees that Bree and Orson will raise him.\n\nBree develops a rivalry with new neighbor, [[Katherine Mayfair]]. Bree and Katherine are very similar, leading to a series of feuds before eventually becoming friends and go into business together, catering dinner parties.\n\nAfter a tornado damages Bree\u2019s house, she, Orson and Benjamin stay with Susan, and Orson admits being responsible for putting Mike in a coma. Horrified, Bree kicks him out. During their separation, [[Edie Britt]] comes onto Orson, leading to a feud between her and Bree. Edie discovers Benjamin is Bree's grandson and attempts to blackmail her. Bree, however, tells the other housewives the truth, so they all snub Edie.\n\nIn the season finale, Katherine saves Bree\u2019s life by telling her ex-husband, Wayne, her secrets. When Katherine kills Wayne, Bree and the other housewives tell the police that Katherine was terrified of a stalker so she doesn't go to prison.\n\nWhen the events of the series shift ahead by five years in the fourth-season finale, it is revealed that Bree is now a famous cookbook author and her son, Andrew, works with her as her assistant. Bree and Orson have evidently worked out their problems and are still together.\n\n===Season 5===\nThe fifth season opens with Bree just having published her own cookbook, and successfully running the catering business. She and Orson reconcile after he went to prison for running over Mike. A flashback sequence reveals that while Bree awaited Orson's release, Danielle returned and took Benjamin, leaving her completely alone. Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine.\n\nBree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. In revenge, Orson begins stealing - initially to punish people who he feels have been rude, and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when Bree learns that he was injured while attempting to rob an old woman (which led to Edie Britt's death) and that he has been trying to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires [[Karl Mayer]] as her divorce lawyer, who convinces her to stage a fake burglary so she can hide her precious/expensive things in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings. However, Orson discovers her plan, threatening to send her to prison for insurance fraud unless she stays with him. Bree agrees reluctantly but shares a passionate kiss with Karl.\n\n===Season 6===\nIn the first episode, Bree is unwilling to sleep with Karl, despite her marriage being strained.  Orson, however, is determined to salvage their relationship, commenting that guilt is sometimes necessary for happiness, and defending his use of blackmail so that she'll stay with him. Bree takes this motto as her own and consummates her affair with Karl.\n\nWhen Julie is hospitalized after being attacked, Bree worries that she will lose Susan's friendship on hearing that Susan would hypothetically no longer talk to a friend who dated Karl. However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business and only realizes the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbor, [[Angie Bolen]], hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree. She discovers the tryst but confronts Bree, who explains that she connects intellectually with Orson but sexually with Karl, and is worried that their relationship will only ever be physical, despite his promises to change.\n\nBree's fears are realized when Susan also finds out about her and Karl. They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does, indicating she has evidence of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce. Stunned, Orson tells Bree that he wouldn't send her to prison for fraud and goes to pack, but discovers her affair with Karl. They fight and Bree tries intervening but when an airplane crashes into Wisteria Lane, Karl is killed and Orson is paralyzed. Feeling guilty, Bree insists Orson come home so she can look after him but he is disgusted by her infidelity and takes advantage. Angry about his lack of manners and personal hygiene, Bree hoses him down but stops when he explains how angry he is with the way his life is now. Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, \nBree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile.\n\nA young man named [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Sam Allen|Sam Allen]] visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to see a photo of Rex and Sam. Sam admits Rex was his father and that he spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love-and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson says Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react.\n\nIn the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he knows how Andrew ran over Carlos' mother years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree agrees to do so and then says she feels sorry for Sam for losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for the man. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for his hit-and-run of Mike but hiding Andrew's crime. He is both appalled and furious at Bree for this and announces he's moving out. Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle.\n\n===Season 7===\nBree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mom [[Juanita \"Mama\" Solis|Mama Solis]] ([[Lupe Ontiveros]]). Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Keith Watson|Keith Watson]] ([[Brian Austin Green]]), to help but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Juanita Solis|Juanita Solis]] ([[Madison De La Garza]]) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agreed to go out clubbing with [[Renee Perry]]. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith.\n\nLater Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he could have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then kisses Bree all of a sudden and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]]'s plan to open a [[halfway house]] for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistaken him as an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to beat Keith up. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the sky and this triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an [[assassination]] attempt, proceed to flee, resulting in a riot that goes out of control.\n\nBree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want.\" Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves.\n\nBree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go into rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years and that they're no longer friends and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends.  Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she will not end her friendship with Bree.  While the Solis' are staying with Bree she has a run in with Detective [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Chuck Vance|Chuck Vance]] ([[Jonathan Cake]]) who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman.  Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number and the Solis' move out of Bree's and back with Carlos.\n\nChuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women's center. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's sincere words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards.\n\nDuring the \"progressive dinner party\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Alejandro Perez|Alejandro Perez]], Gaby's stepfather. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years.\n\n===Season 8===\nFollowing their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement, and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]], asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past he sends her away. However, he later calls her back urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate, and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into [[Martha Huber]]'s death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband and Bree is at first supportive until she finds her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money.\n\nHaving avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Ben Faulkner|Ben Faulkner]] in a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless and Bree realizes that's wrong. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how this is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. At first happy about helping, Bree is horrified to realize the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink.\n\nChuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice. Bree asks her asking if she is happy after having killed herself who replies, \"I'm not unhappy\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her and telling her she's \"nothing more than a skank in a [[Nancy Reagan]] nightie\", Renee notices the gun and the note. After reading it she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \"You're welcome.\"\n\nRenee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little and Bree ends up going with a man, skinny-dipping in a pool before the owner of the house comes home. Bree soon is going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree comes to the bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When [[Karen McCluskey]] says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed-hopping to the point where she hits upon a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention at which point Bree reaches boiling point and blasts them for their less than friend like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree only to be interrupted by a wheelchair-bound Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \"cleaning up each other's messes.\" Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence to the Fairview Police.\n\nBree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help of his cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she has nothing to do with it. But as she was drinking her cup of tea, her fingerprints were on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body, and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. But they do not stop there - a detective tracks down a call of Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it.\n\nIn order to defend herself, Bree asks [[Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott|Bob Hunter]] for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a crime lawyer. He recommends lawyer [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Trip Weston|Trip Weston]], whom he calls a \"shark\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth, and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree marries Trip and moves to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] where she joins a club for conservative women. Later she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council, then the following November she is elected to the [[Kentucky General Assembly|Kentucky Legislature]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical===\nBree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2004Oct1.html |title='Housewives': Worth Staying at Home For |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2004-10-03 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] called Cross \"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\", and applauds her for \"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Goodman |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/01/DDG2J912UF1.DTL |title=Desperately hoping this take on suburban despair survives |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2004-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season2.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\" The Complete Second Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> following the first year's emphasis on [[Susan Delfino|Susan Mayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season1.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\" The Complete First Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2005-10-09-housewives_x.htm |title='Housewives' is dragging desperately |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery.\n\nCross retained her center-stage position for the show's [[Desperate Housewives (season 3)|third season]], which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband [[Orson Hodge|Orson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2006-09-21-review-desperate-premiere_x.htm |title=Plots quicken on 'Housewives' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season3.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\": The Complete Third Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \"loss of steam\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Goldman, Eric |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/817/817558p1.html |title=Desperate Housewives - The Complete Third Season (The Dirty Laundry Edition) |publisher=Uk.dvd.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSeason 4's \"fake pregnancy\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \"hysterical [storyline] yet\", and singling Cross out for praise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stack |first=Tim |url= https://ew.com/recap/season-premiere-desperate-housewives/|title=The season premiere of Desperate Housewives |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season4.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\": The Complete Fourth Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com|accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight.

Whereas, [[Gabrielle Solis]] married Carlos twice making married thrice as well (she married Victor Lang in Season 4)\n*Bree is the only main Housewife not to be pregnant while on the show. Ironically, Cross is the only one of the four leading actresses to get pregnant when the show was filming. \n*Bree and her ex-husband, [[Orson Hodge]] have been accused of killing their previous spouse. \n*Bree has been asked not to marry someone three times:\n**First time to George Williams, by his ex-fianc\u00e9, Leila.\n**Second time to Orson Hodge, by his neighbor, Carolyn.\n**Third time to Karl Mayer, by his ex-wife, Susan.\n*Bree and [[Katherine Mayfair|Katherine]], often depicted as rivals, have shared many similarities beyond excellent cooking:\n**Both have first husbands who are now dead along with second husbands which have left them.\n**Both have daughters who have children of their own (however, in Katherine's cases, to her adopted daughter).\n**Both have been romantically involved with one of Susan's (ex-)husbands. \n**Both have red hair (however in Bree's case its unnatural)\n**Both wedded doctors. \n*Bree, Edie Rothwell and Susan Mayer are the only three housewives who have slept with Karl Mayer. \n*Bree and Gabrielle Solis are the only housewives who have cheated on their husbands. \n*Out of the main housewives, Bree is the only one who has killed someone purposely, since Susan killed Lillia Dash accidentally.

[[Dana Delany]], who eventually was cast as [[Katherine Mayfair]], was originally chosen for the role but turned it down, saying it was too similar to her role in ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=James Brady|title=In Step With...Dana Delany|date=2008-04-27|publisher=Parade Magazine|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_04-27-2008/In_Step_With...Dana_Delany|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530205941/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2008/edition_04-27-2008/In_Step_With...Dana_Delany|archivedate=2008-05-30}}</ref>\n\nBree's main struggle throughout the series has been her attempts to maintain a perfect life despite various obstacles such as widowhood, divorce, and alcoholism hindering her. She has been married three times; to [[Rex Van de Kamp]] ([[Steven Culp]]), [[Orson Hodge]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), and [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Trip Weston|Trip Weston]] ([[Scott Bakula]]).\n\n==Character profile==\nBree Van de Kamp is one of the four main protagonists in ''Desperate Housewives''. Bree grew up in Rhode Island when her father married a woman named Eleanor, after her mother's death, with whom she did not get along. In order to escape her stepmother's demands, Bree left for [[Lake Forest College]] near [[Chicago]]. Bree also mentioned on one of Eleanor's visits that she had to work for every kind word she ever was given from her step-mother. Bree met [[Rex Van de Kamp]] at a meeting of the [[Young Republicans]]. After they graduated, they married and had two children, [[Andrew Van de Kamp|Andrew]] and [[Danielle Van de Kamp|Danielle]], and moved to [[Wisteria Lane|Fairview]].\n\nBree is very much written as an exaggerated version of the characteristics often attributed to [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] Americans; she has been called a \"hyper-uptight WASP.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paul D. Sweeney|author2=Dean B. McFarlin|title=International Management: Strategic Opportunities and Cultural Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYCQBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA200|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=200}}</ref> Bree is recognized for her perfectionist attitude and work ethic, which at times border on [[neurosis]] and [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. While the writers have shied away from an official diagnosis, the character is recognized as suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]]. The character herself refers to her \"quirks\" in terms of [[anal retentiveness]] but Rex once mentioned it by the name. Bree's perfectionism may stem from when her mother was killed in a hit and run: a 10-year-old Bree cleaned her blood off the road outside the house. She said that once everything was spotless, she felt much better.\n\nBree is known for her homemaking talents on the level of [[Martha Stewart]], particularly her gourmet meals, breakfast treats and pineapple bran [[muffin]]s. She is also well versed in firearms; she owns four guns and is a card-carrying member of the [[National Rifle Association]]. Bree supports the Republican Party, as stated in the season 3 opener, and is also known for being a member of the local [[Presbyterian]] church, as shown in the episode ''[[Sunday (Desperate Housewives)|Sunday]]''. Her neighbors [[Angie Bolen]], [[Gabrielle Solis]] and [[Renee Perry]] have nicknamed her '[[Nancy Reagan]]' on occasions.\n\nShe has lived at 4354 [[Wisteria Lane]] in Fairview since 1994 and is also said to have a timeshare residence in Aspen that she never uses.\nBree is based on creator [[Marc Cherry]]'s own mother, and the Van de Kamp family is based on the family in which he grew up. Bree's family was based on Marc Cherry's teen years, while [[Lynette Scavo]]'s family is based on Marc Cherry's childhood years.<ref name=\"hamptonroads\">{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/147651|title=Mother of ''Desperate Housewives'' creator featured in season two extras|date=September 1, 2006|publisher=The Virginian Pilot|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref> Bree and her first husband, Rex, were both named after the overtly vain characters on two of [[Marc Cherry]]'s previous failed sitcoms, ''[[The 5 Mrs. Buchanans]]'' (Bree) and ''[[The Crew (TV series)|The Crew]]'' (Rex).\n\nBoth of Bree's marriages have broken down and ended in divorce (Rex, however, died before their divorce was finalized). Following the request for divorce, both of Bree's former husbands attempted reconciliation with her. Rex succeeded, whereas her second husband [[Orson Hodge]] did not. During the breakdown of her second marriage, Bree had an affair with [[Karl Mayer]], her divorce lawyer and ex-husband of her friend, [[Susan Delfino]]. Bree, however, did remarry in the series finale to her lawyer, Trip Weston, making him her third husband.\n\nBree is the only one of the main four housewives not to appear in every episode. Appearing only as a [[stand-in]] in \"[[My Husband, The Pig]]\", Bree is totally absent in its six following episodes (\"[[Dress Big]]\", \"[[Liaisons (Desperate Housewives)|Liaisons]]\", \"[[God, That's Good]]\", \"[[Gossip (Desperate Housewives)|Gossip]]\", \"[[Into the Woods (Desperate Housewives)|Into the Woods]]\" and \"[[What Would We Do Without You?]]\") due to Cross' pregnancy.\n\n==Overview==\n===Past===\nBree Mason was born in the year 1962. When she was 10 years old, her mother taught her a lesson about \"masking\" so she could hide true feelings and emotions, which prevented her from being able to be hurt by men. Shortly after, during [[Christmas]] 1972, her mother died in hospital after a car accident. Bree stayed at home and cleaned her mother's blood from the driveway. She felt relieved after that. Her father then married Eleanor. Bree had to earn respect from her stepmother and so worked very hard. Eleanor said to her stepdaughter that she was very lucky and possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight: weapons all women needed to survive in the world. Her dad took care of his daughter and tried to raise her to be a classic lady.\n\nShe got engaged to her boyfirend, Ty Grant, but met Rex Van de Kamp and the two fell in love during college. Bree and Rex got married in 1987. Bree gave birth to her son Andrew in 1988 and daughter Danielle in 1989. The family moved to 4354 Wisteria Lane, Fairview and she gave a bad first impression to Mary Alice Young and Susan Mayer, after Andrew stole a ceramic frog from the Youngs' backyard. Bree, Susan and Mary Alice become close friends and in 1998 Lynette Scavo joined the group. 5 years later, after a short and difficult first impression of Gabrielle Solis, all four women accepted the ex-model as their friend.\n\n===Season 1===\nBree Van de Kamp is introduced as the \"perfect\" wife and mother. However, it becomes apparent that her emotional coldness and obsession with appearances makes her family resent her, and as her husband Rex put it \"I just can't live in this detergent commercial anymore\".\n\nShe insists she and Rex have marriage guidance counseling when he wants a divorce, and demands that Andrew and Danielle refuse presents from their father if they want to continue living with her. Unfortunately, in Andrew's case, this leads to him drink-driving and accidentally knocking down [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]], leaving her seriously injured. Rex and Bree conceal this to protect him but Bree is soon disappointed with his lack of remorse. Determined to make him realize that there are consequences to his actions, she reveals, in an anonymous tip-off to the coach of the swimming team, that Andrew keeps marijuana in his locker. This discovery results in him being removed from the team. Bree is determined to keep her family together until Rex has a heart attack, leading her to discover that he regularly visited a prostitute. Worse still, the prostitute turns out to be an acquaintance of hers, Maisy Gibbons, who is later arrested for living off immoral earnings. Maisy is persuaded to do a deal with the District Attorney, naming her clients and despite a request from Bree, does not remove Rex's name. Furious, Bree tells Rex she will divorce him but is \"persuaded\" by Andrew and Danielle to look after him, while he recuperates from a heart attack. Initially wanting to hurt him, Bree starts dating local pharmacist, [[George Williams (Desperate Housewives)|George Williams]], but ends things when Rex asks her to give their marriage another chance. She and George agree to be just friends. Wanting to stop Rex visiting prostitutes, she reluctantly takes part in [[Sadism and masochism|S&M]] scenarios with him.\n\nConcerned about Andrew's worsening behavior, she is cheered when Rex backs her up on one occasion. Unfortunately this doesn't make any difference so Rex and Bree feel that they have no choice but to send Andrew away to a boot camp. While there, Andrew reveals to his parents that he is gay. Bree initially tells him that she will always love him regardless but quietly insists to Rex that they take Andrew home immediately, worried about what he might be doing with the other boys at night, and asks their vicar to give Andrew some counseling on lifestyle, believing that his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is in danger. This has disastrous results, as Andrew thinks she doesn't love him and deliberately hurts her. Bree continues to confide in George about her family problems but, after Rex makes it clear that Bree will stay with him, George begins tampering with Rex's medication. This is uncovered when Rex has a second heart attack. Believing Bree was responsible, Rex writes a note forgiving her and dies. Bree's final scenes in the season involve her receiving the bad news and breaking down in tears.\n\n===Season 2===\nIn Season 2, Bree's mother-in-law, Phyllis (Shirley Knight), visits for her son's funeral. She so annoys Bree with her constant sniping and excessive displays of grief that Bree tells her that she cannot attend Rex's funeral, but Andrew persuades her to. The final straw, however, is when she discovers Phyllis reported her friendship with George to the company handling Rex's life insurance. Bree sends Phyllis home and is questioned by the police about meddling with Rex's medication. She is cleared and is furious when she discovers the note Rex had left her which claimed he thought she murdered him and she starts dating George. However, George constantly tries to rush things, making her uneasy. When George places an announcement of their engagement in the local paper, an ex-fianc\u00e9e of his visits Bree to warn her about him. Bree is horrified and sends the woman away but she is proved right when George loses his temper with an old school friend of Bree's, so she ends their relationship. He tries blackmailing her into a reconciliation by taking some pills and admits killing Rex. Devastated, Bree says that she has called an ambulance and it will be there soon, but in reality, she hasn't. She watches him die and tells Andrew, who tries blackmailing her for his trust fund.\n \nEvents with Rex, George and Andrew take their toll and she starts drinking heavily. She realizes she has a problem when she loses Lynette's children after passing out while babysitting. Andrew later begins making accusations about Bree physically abusing him and tries to seek emancipation rights, which Bree refuses. In denial, but not wanting Andrew to get his trust fund or give up on him, Bree joins AA but only takes it seriously after passing out in a shop changing room and not waking up until late at night. Her AA sponsor, Peter, and a security guard let her out. Bree also faces more turmoil when she discovers her new neighbors, the Applewhites are hiding from the police and is blackmailed into silence. To distract herself from her alcoholism, she has a brief relationship with Peter, who is addicted to sex. However, Andrew discovers this and seduces Peter to get revenge on Bree for denying him his trust fund. She dumps Peter and throws Andrew out after discovering that they slept together and in her bed.\n\nBree's mental health deteriorates rapidly following this and nobody can help her as her behavior becomes erratic and spirals out of control including creating a scene at Danielle's birthday party. Danielle, meanwhile, starts dating [[Matthew Applewhite]] and moves out to be with him. However, Matthew's mother, [[Betty Applewhite]], realizes Matthew murdered an ex-girlfriend, Melanie Foster. She tells Bree, who has checked herself into a psychiatric unit and later escapes after they refuse to let her leave. Bree and Betty rush to Bree's house to find Matthew and Danielle have taken money from Bree's safe. Bree confronts Matthew about Melanie and refuses to let them leave, so he threatens to shoot her, but the police, called by Betty, shoot him first. Bree then has to console Danielle. Bree's final scenes involve her beginning a new friendship with the mysterious [[Orson Hodge]].\n\n===Season 3===\nSeason three sees Bree marrying Orson after a six-month relationship, but their marriage is troubled by the belief that Orson physically abused his first wife, [[Alma Hodge|Alma]] ([[Valerie Mahaffey]]), and murdered her. Shortly after the wedding, Orson persuades Andrew to come home and they reconcile.\n\nHowever, the arrival of Orson's mother, [[Gloria Hodge|Gloria]] ([[Dixie Carter]]), and Alma's return, cause more trouble. They drug and rape Orson but Bree intervenes, learning that Gloria murdered Orson's mistress, Monique Polier, so he would stay with Alma. Gloria tries to kill Bree but Orson intervenes. Gloria has a severe stroke after Orson holds her head under water to get her to let go of the knife about to be used to kill Bree. Orson carries Gloria's body outside and places it next to Alma's body after  she died when falling from the roof of her house.\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, finds herself pregnant by Edie's nephew Austin ([[Josh Henderson]]). She is sent away so the neighborhood won't learn of her pregnancy and Bree and Orson decide to fake a pregnancy so they can raise Danielle's child as their own.\n\nBree is not in episodes 3.16 to 3.22 as she is on honeymoon with Orson and Danielle. Bree returns for Gabrielle and Victor's wedding, heavily pregnant or so it seems...\n\n===Season 4===\nIn season four, Bree and Orson struggle to make people think she is pregnant but is dismayed by people wanting to feel the baby move. Phyllis, Rex\u2019s mother, discovers Bree\u2019s pregnancy hoax and tries convincing Danielle to raise the child herself. Bree and Orson, however, persuade Danielle to give them the baby by offering to send her to college and buy her a convertible. Danielle has a baby boy and gives him to Bree \u2014 who names him Benjamin Tyson Hodge (surname later changed to Katz) \u2014 and agrees that Bree and Orson will raise him.\n\nBree develops a rivalry with new neighbor, [[Katherine Mayfair]]. Bree and Katherine are very similar, leading to a series of feuds before eventually becoming friends and go into business together, catering dinner parties.\n\nAfter a tornado damages Bree\u2019s house, she, Orson and Benjamin stay with Susan, and Orson admits being responsible for putting Mike in a coma. Horrified, Bree kicks him out. During their separation, [[Edie Britt]] comes onto Orson, leading to a feud between her and Bree. Edie discovers Benjamin is Bree's grandson and attempts to blackmail her. Bree, however, tells the other housewives the truth, so they all snub Edie.\n\nIn the season finale, Katherine saves Bree\u2019s life by telling her ex-husband, Wayne, her secrets. When Katherine kills Wayne, Bree and the other housewives tell the police that Katherine was terrified of a stalker so she doesn't go to prison.\n\nWhen the events of the series shift ahead by five years in the fourth-season finale, it is revealed that Bree is now a famous cookbook author and her son, Andrew, works with her as her assistant. Bree and Orson have evidently worked out their problems and are still together.\n\n===Season 5===\nThe fifth season opens with Bree just having published her own cookbook, and successfully running the catering business. She and Orson reconcile after he went to prison for running over Mike. A flashback sequence reveals that while Bree awaited Orson's release, Danielle returned and took Benjamin, leaving her completely alone. Devastated, Bree relapsed into alcoholism but overcame it, thanks to Katherine.\n\nBree puts her career first, alienating her friends at times and causing a rift between her and Orson. In revenge, Orson begins stealing - initially to punish people who he feels have been rude, and to hurt Bree. Orson agrees to stop stealing, but when Bree learns that he was injured while attempting to rob an old woman (which led to Edie Britt's death) and that he has been trying to convince people that the old woman is senile, she decides she has had enough. She hires [[Karl Mayer]] as her divorce lawyer, who convinces her to stage a fake burglary so she can hide her precious/expensive things in a storage unit and not risk losing them in the divorce proceedings. However, Orson discovers her plan, threatening to send her to prison for insurance fraud unless she stays with him. Bree agrees reluctantly but shares a passionate kiss with Karl.\n\n===Season 6===\nIn the first episode, Bree is unwilling to sleep with Karl, despite her marriage being strained.  Orson, however, is determined to salvage their relationship, commenting that guilt is sometimes necessary for happiness, and defending his use of blackmail so that she'll stay with him. Bree takes this motto as her own and consummates her affair with Karl.\n\nWhen Julie is hospitalized after being attacked, Bree worries that she will lose Susan's friendship on hearing that Susan would hypothetically no longer talk to a friend who dated Karl. However, Karl's fragility convinces Bree he needs her and she begins falling for him, acknowledging her feelings when they attend the same event and Karl brings another woman. This distracts her from her business and only realizes the extent of Katherine's instability when an event is ruined. Bree dismisses her and, after getting to know new neighbor, [[Angie Bolen]], hires her instead. Meanwhile, Karl's romantic gestures make their affair harder to hide. Suspicious, Orson gets Angie to spy on Bree. She discovers the tryst but confronts Bree, who explains that she connects intellectually with Orson but sexually with Karl, and is worried that their relationship will only ever be physical, despite his promises to change.\n\nBree's fears are realized when Susan also finds out about her and Karl. They fight, but despite her initial unhappiness, Susan eventually gives them her blessing. In order to get away from Orson, Karl suggests Bree threaten him, which she does, indicating she has evidence of him breaking his parole, and demands a divorce. Stunned, Orson tells Bree that he wouldn't send her to prison for fraud and goes to pack, but discovers her affair with Karl. They fight and Bree tries intervening but when an airplane crashes into Wisteria Lane, Karl is killed and Orson is paralyzed. Feeling guilty, Bree insists Orson come home so she can look after him but he is disgusted by her infidelity and takes advantage. Angry about his lack of manners and personal hygiene, Bree hoses him down but stops when he explains how angry he is with the way his life is now. Wanting to help, Bree gets two disabled men to visit, but Orson asks her to let him kill himself, telling her that he wants to die because no one loves him. When asked, \nBree can't say the words, but seeing Orson trying to drown himself at a party of an old married couple with such passion causes Bree to realize that she still wants things to work with Orson. She stops him by telling him how much she cares and wants to recapture what they once had, and they reconcile.\n\nA young man named [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Sam Allen|Sam Allen]] visits Bree, offering himself as a new assistant. Impressed by Sam's skills, Bree promotes him to vice-president, much to Andrew's anger. While visiting Sam's home, Bree is stunned to see a photo of Rex and Sam. Sam admits Rex was his father and that he spent years watching Bree's family, wondering why Rex chose them over him, and after his mother's death, came to see Bree. Shocked by this, Bree welcomes Sam into her life but finds herself at odds with Andrew, who suspects Sam has an ulterior motive. Sam plots to make Bree fire Andrew, which she does, but after she reveals that she and Andrew have a love-and-hate relationship, it's likely that Andrew will return. After she tells Orson about a sabotaged dinner, suspecting Andrew, Orson says Andrew couldn't be responsible because it was well planned, making Bree suspect Sam's true intentions. She discovers that Sam's mother is still alive and reveals that Sam found a letter from Rex, offering to take full custody of him. Bree confronts Sam about his lies and he angrily smashes a vase before leaving. She apologizes to Andrew but tells him and Orson she's not firing Sam for fear of how he might react.\n\nIn the season finale, Bree does try firing Sam but he retaliates by revealing he knows how Andrew ran over Carlos' mother years before (a drunken Danielle told him). He threatens to tell the police unless Bree turns over control of the company to him. Bree agrees to do so and then says she feels sorry for Sam for losing his chance to be part of a family and suspects no one will ever truly care for the man. Orson, who had not known what Andrew did, calls out Bree on the hypocrisy of demanding he go to jail for his hit-and-run of Mike but hiding Andrew's crime. He is both appalled and furious at Bree for this and announces he's moving out. Bree tells Andrew she now knows Orson was right and is seen about to confess to Gabrielle.\n\n===Season 7===\nBree confesses to covering up the demise of Carlos' mom [[Juanita \"Mama\" Solis|Mama Solis]] ([[Lupe Ontiveros]]). Gabrielle chooses not to tell her husband. After discovering her ex-husband has a new girlfriend only a week after they separated, Bree decides to redecorate the ground floor of her house, hiring [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Keith Watson|Keith Watson]] ([[Brian Austin Green]]), to help but finds herself attracted to him. While looking at him from her car, she does not see [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Juanita Solis|Juanita Solis]] ([[Madison De La Garza]]) behind her before reversing, leading to Juanita being admitted to hospital. Upon finding out that Keith has a girlfriend, she agreed to go out clubbing with [[Renee Perry]]. She finds out that Keith broke up with his girlfriend, but he is instead going home with Renee. Bree sabotages their night and eventually asks Keith on a date. This begins Bree and Renee's fight over Keith.\n\nLater Bree only mentioned to Richard Watson, father of Keith, that she's finally a divorcee. Learning this, Richard, who has been having feelings for Bree, tries to make a move to destroy Bree's and Keith's relationship so that he could have Bree instead. Keith attempts to propose to Bree and after the second failed attempt, Keith begins to question his relationship with Bree. Richard manipulates Keith's mind by warning him that Bree might be using him as a diversion from her actual feelings after her divorce from Orson. As a result, Keith begins to avoid Bree. Richard then kisses Bree all of a sudden and after he leaves, Bree tells Keith everything about his father's attempts to tear them apart. Later, Keith confronts Richard about this and has a fistfight with him but when rioters, who are opposing [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]]'s plan to open a [[halfway house]] for ex-convicts on Wisteria Lane, see the two fight, they mistaken him as an ex-convict due to his tattoos and ex-convict-like clothing and begin to beat Keith up. Bree breaks up the fight by firing a gun into the sky and this triggers fear and panic among the rioters and supporters for the halfway house alike, thinking this is an [[assassination]] attempt, proceed to flee, resulting in a riot that goes out of control.\n\nBree is thrown when Orson returns, claiming he was dumped by his girlfriend. Keith is annoyed at how Bree is willing to let Orson stay with them. Over dinner, Orson makes it clear he doesn't think Keith is a good choice for Bree as they have nothing in common and Orson understands her more, the two throwing food at one another. Bree goes to see Orson's ex, who reveals that Orson was the one who broke up with her as he's still in love with Bree. She confronts him and Orson confesses how he feels and thinks Bree is too good for Keith. Keith is angered at Bree continuing to want Orson to stay with them, saying that she's still in love with Orson. Bree responds by shoving him down in her manure-covered lawn, getting herself dirty to prove how much she's changed. When one of Keith's old girlfriends comes by, Bree is suspicious and discovers the woman has been raising Keith's son. She mentions children to Keith, who seems unsure whether he is father material. Bree goes to the girlfriend, lying about how Keith doesn't want to know the child. Keith finds her cutting up her roses as she says \"you have to be ruthless to protect what you want.\" Bree meets the woman later to lend her money and when she leaves her son in Bree's care, Keith drops by the pizza parlor. Seeing Keith and the boy instantly bonding, Bree is overcome with guilt and confesses to Keith that the boy is actually his son. Keith desperately wants to be with his son, but he doesn't want to leave Bree, he pitches the idea of moving to Florida with Bree but she refuses to leave her home and friends. The next day Bree makes the ultimate decision and tells Keith that he must go to Florida for his son. She sacrifices their relationship and Keith leaves.\n\nBree discovers that Andrew has started drinking again, so much so that his husband leaves him. She encourages Andrew to go into rehab but is jarred when he decides to make amends by telling Carlos about running over his mother. When Carlos invites Andrew on a camping trip, Bree and Gabrielle fear the worst and follow them. Seeing Carlos with a bloody towel and a dirty shovel, Bree blurts out what Andrew did, just before her son enters the cabin. Carlos is outraged over this but eventually forgives Andrew. However, when Bree comes to thank him for not pressing charges, Carlos coldly tells her he won't forgive her for hiding the truth all these years and that they're no longer friends and that she and Gabby can no longer be friends.  Bree ends up taking Gabby and her daughters into her house when Gabby leaves Carlos after telling him that she will not end her friendship with Bree.  While the Solis' are staying with Bree she has a run in with Detective [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Chuck Vance|Chuck Vance]] ([[Jonathan Cake]]) who was on Wisteria Lane to check on parolee Felicia Tillman.  Juanita Solis calls the police and tells them that Bree is trying to kill her and Celia (after Carlos tells her Bree's involvement in her grandmother's death). Chuck responds to the call at Bree's home and Carlos sorts everything out, explaining that the girls misunderstood what he had told them. Chuck leaves and gives Bree his number and the Solis' move out of Bree's and back with Carlos.\n\nChuck later returns to give Bree his number again after assuming she'd lost it since he hasn't received a call from her. Bree then agrees to go out on a date with him that night and when Bree tells this to Renee, Renee runs a background check on Chuck and reveals to Bree that he's still married (though he had filed for divorce a year ago). At dinner, Bree confronts Chuck with this information but Chuck retaliates by telling her that he had also run a background check on her, therefore becoming more aware of Bree's past. Offended, Bree abruptly ends their date and as Chuck drives her home, Chuck catches a hooker in the street and brings her back to the women's center. There, Chuck tells the hooker (who believes that she'll be a hooker forever) that she can turn her life around, pretending to reveal that Bree once was a prostitute and she had turned over a new leaf by going to school and starting a massive catering company. Moved by Chuck's sincere words, Bree gives Chuck a second chance and the two agree to go out on another date afterwards.\n\nDuring the \"progressive dinner party\" celebrating Susan's return to Wisteria Lane, Bree (along with Lynette and Susan) walks into Gaby's house to discover that Carlos has murdered [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Alejandro Perez|Alejandro Perez]], Gaby's stepfather. She spearheads the decision to cover up the murder to protect Carlos, thus earning his forgiveness for keeping the secret about his mother's hit-and-run for all those years.\n\n===Season 8===\nFollowing their agreement to cover up the murder of Alejandro, Bree's relationship with Chuck begins to suffer. She finds herself constantly paranoid that he will discover her involvement, and uses sex as a way to distract him. She then receives a note exactly like the one Mary Alice received when she shot herself. She then seeks out the counsel of [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]], asking if he was the one who sent it. Upset over the fact that Bree may still judge him for his past he sends her away. However, he later calls her back urging her to tell the other housewives to spare her Mary Alice's fate, and reveals to her the only other person who he told about the note to was the cop who was looking into [[Martha Huber]]'s death, Chuck. At first suspicious, Bree decides to break up with Chuck when he tries to propose. He does not take it well, telling her she is making a big mistake. Danielle returns, having been dumped by her husband and Bree is at first supportive until she finds her daughter is now selling adult swings to make money.\n\nHaving avoided church over her guilt in hiding Alejandro, Bree is convinced to help [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Ben Faulkner|Ben Faulkner]] in a soup kitchen. When a passing college student raves over her cooking, the kitchen is soon home to regular people, not the homeless and Bree realizes that's wrong. She tells everyone to leave, giving a speech on how this is meant to help the less fortunate. Ben is impressed and has Bree give a speech to the city council to convince them to let Ben build a homeless shelter in Fairview. At first happy about helping, Bree is horrified to realize the spot Ben is about to break ground on is where the girls buried Alejandro. She, Gabrielle and Lynette go to dig the body back up only to find it gone. It turns out Ben found it earlier, thinking he was just a drifter and Bree convinces him to help keep it quiet. However, Bree soon finds Chuck is suspicious and putting together clues to prove what the girls did. The pressure soon drives Bree to break her sobriety and pour herself a drink.\n\nChuck starts to dig deeper into Gabrielle's stepfather's disappearance. Gabrielle tells Bree that Chuck brought them in for questioning and Bree snaps, causing her to head to a motel. When she arrives she sits at a table in her room, pulls out a bottle of wine and a gun, and begins talking to the spirit of Mary Alice. Bree asks her asking if she is happy after having killed herself who replies, \"I'm not unhappy\". Bree is ready to kill herself when Renee kicks in the door, mistakenly believing Bree is with Ben. After yelling, threatening to hit her and telling her she's \"nothing more than a skank in a [[Nancy Reagan]] nightie\", Renee notices the gun and the note. After reading it she takes Bree home and stays there to make sure she's okay. When Renee says she won't let a friend die, Bree points out they're not quite friends, hurting Renee. She confesses to Bree how her own mother committed suicide and makes Bree see it's not the way out. Bree is happy at first, more so when she hears Chuck was killed in a hit-and-run. However, when she opens her mailbox, she finds a note saying \"You're welcome.\"\n\nRenee takes Bree to a bar, encouraging her to live a little and Bree ends up going with a man, skinny-dipping in a pool before the owner of the house comes home. Bree soon is going to bed with a succession of men which gets the Reverend concerned about her behavior. Determined to show he's wrong, Bree comes to the bake sale where she meets one of her lovers, only to discover he's married. When [[Karen McCluskey]] says that they do not know what Bree is really like, Bree decides to live up her reputation as the new town slut. Bree is soon bed-hopping to the point where she hits upon a man in a bar without remembering she had gone home with him just two nights previously. When they hear about Renee taking Bree to a bar, her friends try and stage an intervention at which point Bree reaches boiling point and blasts them for their less than friend like behavior recently. At the bar, she's approached by a man and realizes how far she's fallen, ready to go home. The man follows her to the parking lot, threatening to assault Bree only to be interrupted by a wheelchair-bound Orson. He uses a taser to knock the man out, telling Bree her friends called him to help and if there's one thing they did well together, it was \"cleaning up each other's messes.\" Orson soon convinces Bree that the girls are still angry at her and to go away with him for a weekend. What Bree doesn't know is that Orson has been stalking her for months, seeing the girls bury Alejandro's body and he was the one leaving Bree the notes as part of his warped scheme to win her back. Bree soon discovers the truth while visiting Orson's apartment and despite his claims he did it all for her, she says she wants nothing to do with him. Orson calls her later, claiming that their love requires sacrifice and Bree believes he's going to kill himself. Instead, Orson mails a folder of evidence to the Fairview Police.\n\nBree is surprised when Andrew comes home, engaged to a woman named Mary Beth. Learning she's an heiress, Bree suspects Andrew is just marrying her for her money. Mary Beth tells Bree she knows Andrew is gay but is still willing to marry him as she's been unlucky in love. Bree convinces Mary Beth to find a man who truly loves her and she breaks up with Andrew. Andrew is upset at losing a chance at the money but Bree tells him he can stay with her and accept her help getting back on his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, the police become suspicious of Bree and the murder of Gaby's stepfather and the help of his cover-up, so they tread carefully in trying to get proof that she is one of the suspects. They interview her, and she says that she has nothing to do with it. But as she was drinking her cup of tea, her fingerprints were on the mug. The fingerprint that the police found on the body, and the fingerprint on Bree's cup match. The police go and talk to Ben, still about the murder of Alejandro. Ben keeps Bree's secret, and the police leave, with no more evidence than the fingerprint. But they do not stop there - a detective tracks down a call of Bree to Ben that night regarding Alejandro's murder, and they record it.\n\nIn order to defend herself, Bree asks [[Bob Hunter and Lee McDermott|Bob Hunter]] for legal advice, but he tells her she needs a crime lawyer. He recommends lawyer [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Trip Weston|Trip Weston]], whom he calls a \"shark\". Bree goes to trial but does not tell Trip all the truth, and is about to go to prison until Mrs. McCluskey confesses the murder of Alejandro herself, after Bree and the girls agree to take care of her during her last days of life. Bree is acquitted of all charges. In the end, Bree ends up getting married to Trip and moving to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] where she joins a club for conservative women. Later she is encouraged by Trip to run for the city council, then the following November she is elected to the [[Kentucky General Assembly|Kentucky Legislature]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical===\nBree has received wide acclaim, both for the character's storylines, and for Cross' portrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A409-2004Oct1.html |title='Housewives': Worth Staying at Home For |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2004-10-03 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> In a review of the pilot, Tim Goodman from the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] called Cross \"almost too perfect as uptight Bree\", and applauds her for \"managing to give the character more shadings than merely insanely perfect.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Goodman |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/01/DDG2J912UF1.DTL |title=Desperately hoping this take on suburban despair survives |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2004-10-01 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the commencement of the second season, Bree was widely considered the series' most prominent role,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season2.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\" The Complete Second Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> following the first year's emphasis on [[Susan Delfino|Susan Mayer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season1.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\" The Complete First Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Though a drop in quality was noted in the second season,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2005-10-09-housewives_x.htm |title='Housewives' is dragging desperately |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Bree's battles with alcohol, her teenage son, and her murderous pharmacist lover, while continuing to deal with the death of her husband, were well received, and considered the focal point of the series in light of the lagging Applewhite mystery.\n\nCross retained her center-stage position for the show's [[Desperate Housewives (season 3)|third season]], which widely focused upon the mystery surrounding her new husband [[Orson Hodge|Orson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianco |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2006-09-21-review-desperate-premiere_x.htm |title=Plots quicken on 'Housewives' |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Critics noted an improvement in quality from the second season to the third,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season3.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\": The Complete Third Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> and many deemed Bree's storyline to be the most satisfying of the season, as well as noting a \"loss of steam\" during Cross' maternity leave at the latter part of the season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Goldman, Eric |url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/817/817558p1.html |title=Desperate Housewives - The Complete Third Season (The Dirty Laundry Edition) |publisher=Uk.dvd.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSeason 4's \"fake pregnancy\" storyline continued to satisfy critics, with one calling it the series' most \"hysterical [storyline] yet\", and singling Cross out for praise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stack |first=Tim |url= https://ew.com/recap/season-premiere-desperate-housewives/|title=The season premiere of Desperate Housewives |website=Entertainment Weekly |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/desperatehousewives-season4.html |title=\"Desperate Housewives\": The Complete Fourth Season DVD Review - Page 1 of 2 |publisher=Dvdizzy.com|accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Her friction with Katherine Mayfair was also noted as a highlight.

These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations.

World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championships]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries.

By 1902, the [[Western Pennsylvania Hockey League]] was the first to employ professionals. The league joined with teams in Michigan and Ontario to form the first fully professional league\u2014the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL)\u2014in 1904. The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used.

During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood. Direct trauma to the head is estimated to account for 80% of all hockey injuries as a result of player contact with other players or hockey equipment.<ref name=\"hughston.com\"/>\n\nOne of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Women's ice hockey}} Women's ice hockey ==\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa. Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]].

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The number of teams has since increased to 28 from eight different countries.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]]. The IIHF is an annual national team tournament.]]\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]].

These games were brought to North America and several similar winter games using informal rules were developed, such as [[shinny]] and ice polo. The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in [[Montreal]], where the [[first indoor hockey game]] was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and [[professional ice hockey]] originated around 1900. The [[Stanley Cup]], emblematic of ice hockey club supremacy, was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the NHL. In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, the precursor of the IIHF and the sport was played for the first time at the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]] during the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].\n\nIn international competitions, the national teams of six countries (the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|Big Six]]) predominate: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]], [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]], [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russia]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] and [[United States men's national ice hockey team|the United States]]. Of the 69 medals awarded all-time in men's competition at the Olympics, only seven medals were not awarded to one of those countries (or two of their precursors, the Soviet Union for Russia, and Czechoslovakia for the Czech Republic). In the annual [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], 177 of 201 medals have been awarded to the six nations. Teams outside the Big Six have won only five medals in either competition since 1953.<ref>Including former incarnations of them, such as [[Czechoslovakia]] or the [[Soviet Union]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/all-medallists/men.html |title=IIHF World Championships: All Medalists: Men |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[World Cup of Hockey]] is organized by the National Hockey League and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), unlike the annual World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation. World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing for all NHL players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL's [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]. Furthermore, all 12 Women's Olympic and 36 [[IIHF World Women's Championships]] medals were awarded to one of these six countries.

The WPHL and IPHL hired players from Canada; in response, Canadian leagues began to pay players (who played with [[amateur sports|amateurs]]). The IPHL, cut off from its largest source of players, disbanded in 1907. By then, several professional hockey leagues were operating in Canada (with leagues in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec).\n\nIn 1910, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed in Montreal. The NHA would further refine the rules: dropping the rover position, dividing the game into three 20-minute periods and introducing minor and major penalties. After re-organizing as the National Hockey League in 1917, the league expanded into the United States, starting with the Boston Bruins in 1924.\n\nProfessional hockey leagues developed later in Europe, but amateur leagues leading to national championships were in place. One of the first was the Swiss [[National League A]], founded in 1916. Today, professional leagues have been introduced in most countries of Europe. Top European leagues include the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], the [[Czech Extraliga]], the Finnish [[Liiga]] and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].\n\n==Game==\n[[File:Icehockeylayout.svg|thumb|Typical layout of an ice hockey rink surface]]\nWhile the general characteristics of the game stay the same wherever it is played, the exact rules depend on the particular [[Ice hockey rules|code of play]] being used. The two most important codes are those of the IIHF<ref>{{cite book |last=International Ice Hockey Federation |authorlink=International Ice Hockey Federation |title=Official Rule Book 2002\u20132006 |date=September 2002 |url=http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319080459/http://www.iihf.com/pdfRules/IIHFRuleBookeng.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2006}}</ref> and the NHL.<ref>{{cite book |last=National Hockey League |authorlink=National Hockey League |title=Official Rules 2006\u201307 |publisher=Triumph Books |year=2006 |location=Chicago |url=http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090303204304/http://cdn.nhl.com/rules/20062007rulebook.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |isbn=1-894801-03-2 |format=PDF |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both of the codes, and others, originated from Canadian rules of ice hockey of the early 20th Century.\n\nIce hockey is played on a ''[[hockey rink]]''. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The objective of the game is to score ''[[goal (ice hockey)|goals]]'' by shooting a hard [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] rubber disc, the ''[[hockey puck|puck]]'', into the opponent's goal net, which is placed at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.\n\nWithin certain restrictions, players may redirect the puck with any part of their body. Players may not hold the puck in their hand and are prohibited from using their hands to pass the puck to their teammates unless they are in the defensive zone. Players are also prohibited from kicking the puck into the opponent's goal, though unintentional redirections off the skate are permitted. Players may not intentionally bat the puck into the net with their hands.\n[[File:Dynamo Stadium - Ice hockey arena - Panorama after match.jpg|thumb|left|[[VTB Arena]] is an example of an indoor ice hockey arena. The arena is used by [[HC Dynamo Moscow]].]]\nHockey is an [[Offside (ice hockey)|off-side]] game, meaning that forward passes are allowed, unlike in rugby. Before the 1930s, hockey was an on-side game, meaning that only backward passes were allowed. Those rules favoured individual stick-handling as a key means of driving the puck forward. With the arrival of offside rules, the forward pass transformed hockey into a true team sport, where individual performance diminished in importance relative to team play, which could now be coordinated over the entire surface of the ice as opposed to merely rearward players.{{sfn|Dryden |2005 |p=246}}\n\nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and a goaltender. The term ''skaters'' is typically used to describe all players who are not goaltenders. The ''[[Forward (ice hockey)|forward]]'' positions consist of a ''[[Center (ice hockey)|centre]]'' and two ''[[Winger (ice hockey)|wingers]]'': a ''left wing'' and a ''right wing''. Forwards often play together as units or ''lines'', with the same three forwards always playing together. The ''[[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]'' usually stay together as a pair generally divided between left and right. Left and right side wingers or defencemen are generally positioned as such, based on the side on which they carry their stick. A [[substitution (sport)|substitution]] of an entire unit at once is called a ''line change''. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when ''[[short-handed]]'' or on a ''[[Power play (sporting term)|power play]]''. The goaltender stands in a, usually blue, semi-circle called the ''crease'' in the defensive zone keeping pucks from going in. Substitutions are permitted at any time during the game, although during a stoppage of play the home team is permitted the final change. When players are substituted during play, it is called changing ''on the fly''. A new NHL rule added in the 2005\u201306 season prevents a team from changing their line after they ''[[Icing (ice hockey)|ice]]'' the puck.\n[[File:Military appreciation night South Carolina Stingrays.jpg|thumb|Players from the [[South Carolina Stingrays]] perform a line change. A line change is a substitution of an entire [[line (ice hockey)|line]] at once.]] \nThe boards surrounding the ice help keep the puck in play and they can also be used as tools to play the puck. Players are permitted to [[bodycheck]] opponents into the boards as a means of stopping progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not cause a stoppage of the game when the puck or players are influenced (by either bouncing or colliding) into them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. When play is stopped, it is restarted with a [[faceoff]]. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck. Markings (circles) on the ice indicate the locations for the faceoff and guide the positioning of players.\n\nThe three major rules of play in ice hockey that limit the movement of the puck: ''offside'', ''icing'', and the puck going out of play. A player is offside if he enters his [[Hockey rink#Zones|opponent's zone]] before the puck itself. Under many situations, a player may not \"ice the puck\", shoot the puck all the way across both the centre line and the opponent's goal line. The puck goes out of play whenever it goes past the perimeter of the ice rink (onto the player benches, over the [[Plexiglas|glass]], or onto the protective netting above the glass) and a stoppage of play is called by the officials using whistles. It also does not matter if the puck comes back onto the ice surface from those areas as the puck is considered dead once it leaves the perimeter of the rink.\n\nUnder IIHF rules, each team may carry a maximum of 20 players and two goaltenders on their roster. NHL rules restrict the total number of players per game to 18, plus two goaltenders. In the NHL, the players are usually divided into four lines of three forwards, and into three pairs of defencemen. On occasion, teams may elect to substitute an extra defenceman for a forward. The seventh defenceman may play as a substitute defenceman, spend the game on the bench, or if a team chooses to play four lines then this seventh defenceman may see ice-time on the [[fourth line]] as a forward.\n\n===Periods and overtime===\nA professional game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime. Recreational leagues and children's leagues often play shorter games, generally with three shorter periods of play.\n[[File:GM Place Canucks 4 Overtimes.jpg|thumb|left|Scoreboard for a hockey game that ended in the seventh period. If a game is tied at the end of the third period, several leagues and tournaments have teams play additional periods until a goal is scored.]]\nVarious procedures are used if a tie occurs. In tournament play, as well as in the NHL playoffs, North Americans favour ''sudden death [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]]'', in which the teams continue to play twenty-minute periods until a goal is scored. Up until the 1999\u20132000 season regular season NHL games were settled with a single five-minute sudden death period with five players (plus a goalie) per side, with both teams awarded one point in the standings in the event of a tie. With a goal, the winning team would be awarded two points and the losing team none (just as if they had lost in regulation).\n\nFrom the 1999\u20132000 until the 2003\u201304 seasons, the National Hockey League decided ties by playing a single five-minute sudden death overtime period with each team having four skaters per side (plus the goalie). In the event of a tie, each team would still receive one point in the standings but in the event of a victory the winning team would be awarded two points in the standings and the losing team one point. The idea was to discourage teams from playing for a tie, since previously some teams might have preferred a tie and 1 point to risking a loss and zero points. The only exception to this rule is if a team opts to pull their goalie in exchange for an extra skater during overtime and is subsequently scored upon (an ''empty net'' goal), in which case the losing team receives no points for the overtime loss. Since the 2015\u201316 season, the single five-minute sudden death overtime session involves three skaters on each side. Since three skaters must always be on the ice in an NHL game, the consequences of penalties are slightly different from those during regulation play. If a team is on a powerplay when overtime begins, that team will play with more than three skaters (usually four, very rarely five) until the expiration of the penalty. Any penalty during overtime that would result in a team losing a skater during regulation instead causes the non-penalized team to add a skater. Once the penalized team's penalty ends, the number of skaters on each side is adjusted accordingly, with the penalized team adding a skater in regulation and the non-penalized team subtracting a skater in overtime. This goes until the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2015-2016-Interactive-rulebook.pdf |title=National Hockey League Official Rules 2015\u20132016 |publisher=National Hockey League |year=2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Mueller shootout goal.jpg|thumb|Several leagues and tournaments have implemented the [[shootout (hockey)|shootout]] as a means to determine a winner, if the game remains tied after an extra overtime period]]\nInternational play and several North American professional leagues, including the NHL (in the regular season), now use an overtime period identical to that from 1999\u20132000 to 2003\u201304 followed by a [[Shootout (hockey)|penalty shootout]]. If the score remains tied after an extra overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of three players from each team taking penalty shots. After these six total shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, the shootout then proceeds to a ''[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]'' format. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score recorded will award the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time. In the NHL if a game is decided in overtime or by a shootout the winning team is awarded two points in the standings and the losing team is awarded one point. Ties no longer occur in the NHL.\n\nThe overtime mode for the NHL playoffs differ from the regular season. In the playoffs there are no shootouts nor ties. If a game is tied after regulation an additional 20 minutes of 5 on 5 sudden death overtime will be added. In case of a tied game after the overtime, multiple 20-minute overtimes will be played until a team scores, which wins the match. Since 2019, the IIHF World Championships and the medal games in the Olympics use the same format, but in a 3-on-3 format.\n\n===Penalties===\n{{Main|Penalty (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Richard Gynge going to penalty box.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An ice hockey player enters the penalty box. Players may be sent to the [[penalty box]] for rule infractions, forcing their team playing with one less player for a specified time.]]\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to play stoppages whereby the play is restarted at a face off. Some infractions result in the imposition of a ''penalty'' to a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the ''[[penalty box]]'' and their team has to play with one less player on the ice for a designated amount of time. ''Minor'' penalties last for two minutes, ''major'' penalties last for five minutes, and a ''double minor'' penalty is two ''consecutive'' penalties of two minutes duration. A single minor penalty may be extended by a further two minutes for causing visible injury to the victimized player. This is usually when blood is drawn during high sticking. Players may be also assessed personal extended penalties or game expulsions for misconduct in addition to the penalty or penalties their team must serve. The team that has been given a penalty is said to be playing ''short-handed'' while the opposing team is on a ''[[power play (sport)|power play]]''.\n\nA two-minute minor penalty is often charged for lesser infractions such as [[tripping (ice hockey)|tripping]], [[elbow (strike)|elbowing]], [[roughing]], [[high-sticking]], [[delay of game|delay of the game]], [[too many men|too many players on the ice]], [[boarding (ice hockey)|boarding]], illegal equipment, [[charging (ice hockey)|charging]] (leaping into an opponent or body-checking him after taking more than two strides), holding, holding the stick (grabbing an opponent's stick), interference, [[hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]], [[slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]], kneeing, unsportsmanlike conduct (arguing a penalty call with referee, extremely vulgar or inappropriate verbal comments), \"butt-ending\" (striking an opponent with the knob of the stick\u2014a very rare penalty), \"spearing\", or [[cross-checking]]. As of the 2005\u20132006 season, a minor penalty is also assessed for [[diving (ice hockey)|diving]], where a player embellishes or simulates an offence. More egregious fouls may be penalized by a four-minute double-minor penalty, particularly those that injure the victimized player. These penalties end either when the time runs out or when the other team scores during the power play. In the case of a goal scored during the first two minutes of a double-minor, the penalty clock is set down to two minutes upon a score, effectively expiring the first minor penalty. Five-minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, or when a minor penalty results in visible injury (such as bleeding), as well as for fighting. Major penalties are always served in full; they do not terminate on a goal scored by the other team. Major penalties assessed for fighting are typically offsetting, meaning neither team is short-handed and the players exit the penalty box upon a stoppage of play following the expiration of their respective penalties. The foul of boarding (defined as \"check[ing] an opponent in such a manner that causes the opponent to be thrown violently in the boards\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |title=NHL Rulebook |publisher=nhlofficials.com |access-date=October 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025043505/http://www.nhlofficials.com/images/2008_NHL_Rulebook.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is penalized either by a minor or major penalty at the discretion of the referee, based on the violent state of the hit. A minor or major penalty for boarding is often assessed when a player checks an opponent from behind and into the boards.\n[[File:Joel Larsson and Davis Dryden.jpg|thumb|upright|A hockey skater [[Hooking (ice hockey)|hooking]] another skater with his stick in an attempt to restrain him. Hooking is a rule infraction and may result in a minor penalty.]]\nSome varieties of penalties do not always require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have a full complement of players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play for the remainder of the time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute ''misconduct'' penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice ''unless'' a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a ''two-and-ten'' or ''five-and-ten''). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, ''game misconducts'' are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned \"two-and-ten\"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, getting in a fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.\n\nA [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] is awarded to a player when the illegal actions of another player stop a clear scoring opportunity, most commonly when the player is on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. A penalty shot allows the obstructed player to pick up the puck on the centre red-line and attempt to score on the goalie with no other players on the ice, to compensate for the earlier missed scoring opportunity. A penalty shot is also awarded for a defender other than the goaltender covering the puck in the goal crease, a goaltender intentionally displacing his own goal posts during a breakaway to avoid a goal, a defender intentionally displacing his own goal posts when there is less than two minutes to play in regulation time or at any point during overtime, or a player or coach intentionally throwing a stick or other object at the puck or the puck carrier and the throwing action disrupts a shot or pass play.\n\n[[File:Referee hockey ahl 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|An ice hockey referee is responsible for assessing most penalties during a game.]]\nOfficials also stop play for puck movement violations, such as using one's hands to pass the puck in the offensive end, but no players are penalized for these offences. The sole exceptions are deliberately falling on or gathering the puck to the body, carrying the puck in the hand, and shooting the puck out of play in one's defensive zone (all penalized two minutes for delay of game).\n\nIn the NHL, a unique penalty applies to the goalies. The goalies now are forbidden to play the puck in the \"corners\" of the rink near their own net. This will result in a two-minute penalty against the goalie's team. Only in the area in-front of the goal line and immediately behind the net (marked by two red lines on either side of the net) the goalie can play the puck.\n\nAn additional rule that has never been a penalty, but was an infraction in the NHL before recent rules changes, is the [[Two-line pass|two-line offside pass]]. Prior to the 2005\u201306 NHL season, play was stopped when a pass from inside a team's defending zone crossed the centre line, with a face-off held in the defending zone of the offending team. Now, the centre line is no longer used in the NHL to determine a two-line pass infraction, a change that the IIHF had adopted in 1998. Players are now able to pass to teammates who are more than the blue and centre ice red line away.\n\nThe NHL has taken steps to speed up the game of hockey and create a game of finesse, by retreating from the past when illegal hits, fights, and \"clutching and grabbing\" among players were commonplace. Rules are now more strictly enforced, resulting in more penalties, which in turn provides more protection to the players and facilitates more goals being scored. The governing body for United States' amateur hockey has implemented many new rules to reduce the number of stick-on-body occurrences, as well as other detrimental and illegal facets of the game (\"zero tolerance\").\n\nIn men's hockey, but not in women's, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called ''[[Checking (ice hockey)|body checking]]''. Not all physical contact is legal\u2014in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal.\n\nA ''delayed penalty call'' occurs when a penalty offence is committed by the team that does not have possession of the puck. In this circumstance the team with possession of the puck is allowed to complete the play; that is, play continues until a goal is scored, a player on the opposing team gains control of the puck, or the team in possession commits an infraction or penalty of their own. Because the team on which the penalty was called cannot control the puck without stopping play, it is impossible for them to score a goal. In these cases, the team in possession of the puck can pull the goalie for an extra attacker without fear of being scored on. However, it is possible for the controlling team to mishandle the puck into their own net. If a delayed penalty is signalled and the team in possession scores, the penalty is still assessed to the offending player, but not served. In 2012, this rule was changed by the United States' [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) for [[college ice hockey|college level hockey]]. In college games, the penalty is still enforced even if the team in possession scores.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH14.pdf |page=HR\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===Officials===\n{{Main|Official (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Montreal - Burlington 3 decembre 2011 021.jpg|thumb|Officials working under a four-official system. Orange armbands are worn by the referees to distinguish them from the lineswomen.]]\nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four ''[[Official (ice hockey)|officials]]'' on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two ''linesmen'' who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"[[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]]\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs,<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201353}}</ref> and one or two ''referees'',<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201352}}</ref> who call goals and all other penalties. Linesmen can, however, report to the referee(s) that a penalty should be assessed against an offending player in some situations.<ref>{{cite web |author=National Collegiate Athletic Association |title=Ice Hockey 2008\u20132010 Rules and Interpretations |url=http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/IH10.pdf |page=HR\u201354}}</ref> The restrictions on this practice vary depending on the governing rules. On-ice officials are assisted by off-ice officials who act as goal judges, time keepers, and official scorers.\n\nThe most widespread system in use today is the \"three-man system\", that uses one referee and two linesmen. Another less commonly used system is the two referee and one linesman system. This system is very close to the regular three-man system except for a few procedure changes. With the first being the National Hockey League, a number of leagues have started to implement the \"four-official system\", where an additional referee is added to aid in the calling of penalties normally difficult to assess by one single referee. The system is now used in every NHL game, at [[Ice Hockey World Championships|IIHF World Championships]], the [[Olympics]] and in many professional and high-level amateur leagues in North America and Europe.\n\nOfficials are selected by the league they work for. Amateur hockey leagues use guidelines established by national organizing bodies as a basis for choosing their officiating staffs. In North America, the national organizing bodies [[Hockey Canada]] and [[USA Hockey]] approve officials according to their experience level as well as their ability to pass rules knowledge and skating ability tests. Hockey Canada has officiating levels I through VI.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hockey Canada Officiating Department |title=How to Get Started \u2013 Officials |url=http://hockeycanada.com/index.php/ci_id/63557/la_id/1.htm}}</ref> USA Hockey has officiating levels 1 through 4.<ref>{{cite web |author=USA Hockey Officiating Program |title=USA Hockey officials registration program |url=http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512093248/http://www.usahockey.com/uploadedFiles/USAHockey/Menu_Officials/Registration%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Equipment===\n{{Main|Ice hockey equipment}}\n[[File:Wallinheimo Sinuhe JYP.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Goaltenders use more protective equipment than other players, just like goaltender [[Sinuhe Wallinheimo]] pictured here.]]\nSince men's ice hockey is a full contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector.\n \n[[Ice hockey goaltending equipment|Goaltenders]] use different equipment. With hockey pucks approaching them at speeds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) they must wear equipment with more protection. Goaltenders wear specialized goalie skates (these skates are built more for movement side to side rather than forwards and backwards), a jock or jill, large leg pads (there are size restrictions in certain leagues), blocking glove, catching glove, a chest protector, a goalie mask, and a large jersey. Goaltenders' equipment has continually become larger and larger, leading to fewer goals in each game and many official rule changes.\n \nHockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. In addition, they must be rigid and tough to protect the skater's feet from contact with other skaters, sticks, pucks, the boards, and the ice itself. Rigidity also improves the overall manoeuvrability of the skate. Blade length, thickness (width), and curvature (rocker/radius (front to back) and radius of hollow (across the blade width) are quite different from speed or figure skates. Hockey players usually adjust these parameters based on their skill level, position, and body type. The blade width of most skates are about {{convert|1/8|in|mm}} thick.\n \nThe hockey stick consists of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds. It is quite distinct from sticks in other sports games and most suited to hitting and controlling the flat puck. Its unique shape contributed to the early development of the game.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Injury}} Injury ==\nIce hockey is a full contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately {{convert|20|\u2013|30|mph|-1|abbr=on}} and quite a bit of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. The types of injuries associated with hockey include: lacerations, concussions, contusions, ligament tears, broken bones, hyperextensions, and muscle strains. Women's ice hockey players are allowed to contact other players but are not allowed to body check.\n\nCompared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of [[overuse injuries]] and injuries caused by [[early sports specialization]] by teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feeley |first=Brian T. |last2=Agel |first2=Julie |last3=LaPrade |first3=Robert F. |date=January 2016 |title=When Is It Too Early for Single Sport Specialization? |journal=The American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=234\u2013241 |doi=10.1177/0363546515576899 |issn=1552-3365 |pmid=25825379}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Hughston Health Alert, \"Lacerations to the head, scalp, and face are the most frequent types of injury [in hockey].\"<ref name=\"hughston.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822231059/http://www.hughston.com/a-hockey.aspx |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |title=Ice Hockey Injuries |publisher=Hughston Clinic}}</ref> Even a shallow cut to the head results in a loss of a large amount of blood.

Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues, including the NHL have made this a major and game misconduct penalty (called \"boarding\"). Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\"). A check to the head can be defined as delivering a hit while the receiving player's head is down and their waist is bent and the aggressor is targeting the opponent player's head.\n\nThe most dangerous result of a head injury in hockey can be classified as a concussion. Most concussions occur during player-to-player contact rather than when a player is checked into the boards. Checks to the head have accounted for nearly 50% of concussions that players in the National Hockey League have suffered. In recent years, the NHL has implemented new rules which penalize and suspend players for illegal checks to the heads, as well as checks to unsuspecting players. Concussions that players suffer may go unreported because there is no obvious physical signs if a player is not knocked unconscious. This can prove to be dangerous if a player decides to return to play without receiving proper medical attention. Studies show that ice hockey causes 44.3% of all traumatic brain injuries among Canadian children.<ref>Cusimano, MD. Medical News Today. MediLexicon International, n.d. Web. March 4, 2015.</ref> In severe cases, the traumatic brain injuries are capable of resulting in death. Occurrences of death from these injuries are rare.\n\n==Tactics==\n===Checking===\n{{main|Checking (ice hockey)}}\n[[File:Body checking lesson.jpg|thumb|Youths being taught how to properly deliver a check in ice hockey]]\nAn important defensive tactic is checking\u2014attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. ''Stick checking'', ''sweep checking'', and ''poke checking'' are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck. The ''[[neutral zone trap]]'' is designed to isolate the puck carrier in the neutral zone preventing him from entering the offensive zone. ''Body checking'' is using one's shoulder or hip to strike an opponent who has the puck or who is the last to have touched it (the last person to have touched the puck is still legally \"in possession\" of it, although a penalty is generally called if he is checked more than two seconds after his last touch). Body checking is also a penalty in certain leagues in order to reduce the chance of injury to players. Often the term checking is used to refer to body checking, with its true definition generally only propagated among fans of the game.\n\n===Offensive tactics===\n{{main|Shot (ice hockey)|Slapshot|Wrist shot|Snap shot (ice hockey)|Backhand slapshot|Offside (ice hockey)|Extra attacker|Deke (ice hockey)}}\nOffensive tactics include improving a team's position on the ice by advancing the puck out of one's zone towards the opponent's zone, progressively by gaining lines, first your own blue line, then the red line and finally the opponent's blue line. [[National Hockey League rules|NHL rules]] instated for the 2006 season redefined the offside rule to make the two-line pass legal; a player may pass the puck from behind his own blue line, past both that blue line and the centre red line, to a player on the near side of the opponents' blue line. Offensive tactics are designed ultimately to score a goal by taking a shot. When a player purposely directs the puck towards the opponent's goal, he or she is said to \"shoot\" the puck.\n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660199222).jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[National Hockey League|NHL]] fan exhibit, where visitors attempt to deflect the puck off the skaters in front of the goalie in order to score]]\nA ''deflection'' is a shot that redirects a shot or a pass towards the goal from another player, by allowing the puck to strike the stick and carom towards the goal. A ''[[one-timer]]'' is a shot struck directly off a pass, without receiving the pass and shooting in two separate actions. ''Headmanning the puck'', also known as  ''breaking out'', is the tactic of rapidly passing to the player farthest down the ice. ''[[Loafing (ice hockey)|Loafing]]'', also known as ''[[cherry picking (basketball)|cherry-picking]]'', is when a player, usually a forward, skates behind an attacking team, instead of playing defence, in an attempt to create an easy scoring chance.\n\nA team that is losing by one or two goals in the last few minutes of play will often elect to ''pull the goalie''; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an ''[[extra attacker]]'' on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.\n\nOne of the most important strategies for a team is their ''[[forecheck]]''. Forechecking is the act of attacking the opposition in their defensive zone. Forechecking is an important part of the ''[[dump and chase]]'' strategy (i.e. shooting the puck into the offensive zone and then chasing after it). Each team will use their own unique system but the main ones are: [[2-1-2 Forecheck|2\u20131\u20132]], 1\u20132\u20132, and 1\u20134. The 2\u20131\u20132 is the most basic forecheck system where two forwards will go in deep and pressure the opposition's defencemen, the third forward stays high and the two defencemen stay at the blueline. The 1\u20132\u20132 is a bit more conservative system where one forward pressures the puck carrier and the other two forwards cover the oppositions' wingers, with the two defencemen staying at the blueline. The 1\u20134 is the most defensive forecheck system, referred to as the neutral zone trap, where one forward will apply pressure to the puck carrier around the oppositions' blueline and the other 4 players stand basically in a line by their blueline in hopes the opposition will skate into one of them. Another strategy is the [[left wing lock]], which has two forwards pressure the puck and the left wing and the two defencemen stay at the blueline.\n\nThere are many other little tactics used in the game of hockey. ''[[Cycling (ice hockey)|Cycling]]'' moves the puck along the boards in the offensive zone to create a [[scoring chance]] by making defenders tired or moving them out of position. ''Pinching'' is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A ''[[saucer pass]]'' is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.\n\nA [[deke (ice hockey)|deke]], short for \"decoy\", is a [[feint]] with the body or stick to fool a defender or the goalie. Many modern players, such as [[Pavel Datsyuk]], [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Patrick Kane]], have picked up the skill of \"dangling\", which is fancier deking and requires more stick handling skills.\n\n===Fights===\n{{Main|Fighting in ice hockey}}\n[[File:Fight in ice hockey 2009.JPG|thumb|Fighting in ice hockey is officially prohibited in the rules, although it continues to be an established tradition in the sport in North America]]\nAlthough fighting is officially prohibited in the rules, it is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. [[enforcer (ice hockey)|Enforcers]] and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone gets hit by what the team perceives as a dirty hit. The amateur game penalizes fisticuffs more harshly, as a player who receives a fighting major is also assessed at least a 10-minute misconduct penalty (NCAA and some Junior leagues) or a game misconduct penalty and [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] (high school and younger, as well as some casual adult leagues).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |title=KAHC Suspended Players |accessdate=August 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813154239/http://www.usahockey.com/kahc/default.aspx?NAV=AF_06&ID=190764 |archivedate=August 13, 2009}}</ref> Crowds seem to like fighting in ice hockey and cheer when fighting erupts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2009/03/17/hockey_fans_love_fighting_survey_says.html |title=Hockey fans love fighting, survey says |work=Toronto Star |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|Women's ice hockey}} Women's ice hockey ==\nIce hockey is one of the fastest growing women's sports in the world, with the number of participants increasing by 400 percent from 1995 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industry Canada |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |accessdate=December 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927042219/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr-72585e.html |archivedate=September 27, 2004}}</ref> In 2011, Canada had 85,827 women players,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/canada.html |title=IIHF About Hockey Canada |publisher=Iihf.com |date=April 26, 1920 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> United States had 65,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/united-states.html |title=IIHF About United States |publisher=Iihf.com |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Finland 4,760,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/finland.html |title=IIHF About Finland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=February 10, 1928 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> Sweden 3,075<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/sweden.html |title=IIHF About Sweden |publisher=Iihf.com |date=March 23, 1912 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> and Switzerland 1,172.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/countries/switzerland.html |title=IIHF About Switzerland |publisher=Iihf.com |date=November 23, 1908 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> While there are not as many organized leagues for women as there are for men, there exist leagues of all levels, including the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] (CWHL), [[Western Women's Hockey League]], [[National Women's Hockey League]] (NWHL), [[Mid-Atlantic Women's Hockey League]], and various European leagues; as well as university teams, national and Olympic teams, and [[recreation]]al teams.

The daughter of [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley of Preston]], [[Lady Isobel Gathorne-Hardy]] is visible in white.]]\nWomen are known to have played the game in the 19th century. Several games were recorded in the 1890s in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The women of Lord Stanley's family were known to participate in the game of ice hockey on the outdoor ice rink at [[Rideau Hall]], the residence of Canada's Governor-General.\n\nThe game developed at first without an organizing body. A tournament in 1902 between Montreal and Trois-Rivieres was billed as the first championship tournament. Several tournaments, such as at the Banff Winter Carnival, were held in the early 20th century and numerous women's teams such as the Seattle Vamps and Vancouver Amazons existed. Organizations started to develop in the 1920s, such as the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association, and later, the Dominion Women's Amateur Hockey Association. Starting in the 1960s, the game spread to universities. Today, the sport is played from youth through adult leagues, and in the universities of North America and internationally. There have been two major professional women's hockey leagues to have paid its players: the [[National Women's Hockey League]] with teams in the United States and the [[Canadian Women's Hockey League]] with teams in Canada, China, and the United States.\n\nThe first women's world championship tournament, albeit unofficial, was held in 1987 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. This was followed by the [[IIHF World Women's Championships|first IIHF World Championship in 1990]] in Ottawa. Women's ice hockey was added as a medal sport at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano, Japan]].

The league's history began after Canada's National Hockey Association decided to disband in 1917; the result was the creation of the National Hockey League with four teams. The league expanded to the United States beginning in 1924 and had as many as 10 teams before contracting to six teams by 1942\u201343. In 1967, the NHL doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12-team league, the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. In 1979, the 17-team NHL merged with the WHA creating a 21-team league.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/sports/ice-hockey |title=Britannica |last=Fischler |first=Shirley |date= |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> By 2017, the NHL had expanded to 31 teams, and after a realignment in 2013, these teams were divided into two conferences and four divisions.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Hockey-League |title=National Hockey League (NHL) |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=}}</ref> The league is expected to expand to 32 teams by 2021.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), sometimes referred to as \"The A\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |title=Five AHL players to watch the rest of the season |publisher= |access-date=May 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517024932/http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/five-ahl-players-to-watch-the-rest-of-the-season/ |archive-date=May 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> is the primary developmental professional league for players aspiring to enter the NHL. It comprises 31 teams from the United States and Canada. It is run as a \"[[Farm team|farm league]]\" to the NHL, with the vast majority of AHL players under contract to an NHL team. The [[ECHL]] (called the East Coast Hockey League before the 2003\u201304 season) is a mid-level minor league in the United States with a few players under contract to NHL or AHL teams.\n\nAs of 2019, there are three minor professional leagues with no NHL affiliations: the [[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL), [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH), and the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).\n[[File:2007 Memorial Cup warmup.JPG|thumb|Pre-game warmups prior to a [[Memorial Cup]] game. The tourney serves as the championship for the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]].]]\n[[U Sports]] ice hockey is the highest level of play at the Canadian university level under the auspices of U Sports, Canada's governing body for university sports. As these players compete at the university level, they are obligated to follow the rule of standard eligibility of five years.\nIn the United States especially, [[college hockey]] is popular and the best university teams compete in the annual [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. The [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]] is composed of college teams at the club level.\n\nIn Canada, the [[Canadian Hockey League]] is an umbrella organization comprising three major junior leagues: the [[Ontario Hockey League]], the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. It attracts players from Canada, the United States and Europe. The major junior players are considered amateurs as they are under 21-years-old and not paid a salary, however, they do get a stipend and play a schedule similar to a professional league. Typically, the [[NHL draft]]s many players directly from the major junior leagues.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Hockey League]] (USHL) is the highest junior league. Players in this league are also amateur with players required to be under 21-years old, but do not get a stipend, which allows players to retain their eligibility for participation in [[College ice hockey#NCAA|NCAA ice hockey]].\n\n====Eurasia====\n[[File:Stamp-russia2016-hockey-gagarin-cup.png|thumb|A Russian stamp commemorating the [[Gagarin Cup]], which is presented to the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]]'s playoff champion. The KHL is the largest ice hockey league in Eurasia.]]\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is the largest and most popular ice hockey league in [[Eurasia]]. The league is the direct successor to the [[Russian Super League]], which in turn was the successor to the [[Soviet Championship League|Soviet League]], the history of which dates back to the Soviet adoption of ice hockey in the 1940s. The KHL was [[2008\u201309 KHL season|launched in 2008]] with clubs predominantly from Russia, but featuring teams from other [[post-Soviet states]]. The league expanded beyond the former Soviet countries beginning in the [[2011\u201312 KHL season|2011\u201312 season]], with clubs in Croatia and Slovakia. The number of teams has since increased to 28 from eight different countries.\n\nThe second division of hockey in Eurasia is the [[Supreme Hockey League]] (VHL). This league features 24 teams from Russia and 2 from Kazakhstan. This league is currently being converted to a farm league for the KHL, similarly to the AHL's function in relation to the NHL. The third division is the [[Russian Hockey League]], which features only teams from Russia. The [[Asia League Ice Hockey|Asia League]], an international ice hockey league featuring clubs from China, Japan, South Korea, and the Russian Far East, is the successor to the [[Japan Ice Hockey League]].\n\nThe highest junior league in Eurasia is the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|Junior Hockey League]] (MHL). It features 32 teams from post-Soviet states, predominantly Russia. The second tier to this league is the [[Junior Hockey League Championships]] (MHL-B).\n\n====Europe====\n[[File:Lineup (5154107439).jpg|thumb|Players from the [[ZSC Lions]] line up prior to a game. The club plays in the Swiss [[National League A]].]]\nSeveral countries in Europe have their own top professional senior leagues. Many future KHL and NHL players start or end their professional careers in these leagues. The National League A in Switzerland, Swedish Hockey League in Sweden, Liiga in Finland, and Czech Extraliga in the Czech Republic are all very popular in their respective countries.\n\nBeginning in the 2014\u201315 season, the [[Champions Hockey League]] was launched, a league consisting of first-tier teams from several European countries, running parallel to the teams' domestic leagues. The competition is meant to serve as a Europe-wide ice hockey club championship. The competition is a direct successor to the [[European Trophy]] and is related to the 2008\u201309 [[Champions Hockey League (2008\u201309)|tournament of the same name]].\n\nThere are also several annual tournaments for clubs, held outside of league play. [[Season (sports)|Pre-season]] tournaments include the European Trophy, [[Tampere Cup]] and the [[Pajulahti Cup]]. One of the oldest international ice hockey competition for clubs is the [[Spengler Cup]], held every year in [[Davos]], Switzerland, between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was first awarded in 1923 to the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club. The [[Memorial Cup]], a competition for junior-level (age 20 and under) clubs is held annually from a pool of junior championship teams in Canada and the United States.\n\nInternational club competitions organized by the IIHF include the [[IIHF Continental Cup|Continental Cup]], the [[Victoria Cup (ice hockey)|Victoria Cup]] and the European Women's Champions Cup. The [[World Junior Club Cup]] is an annual tournament of [[junior ice hockey]] clubs representing each of the top junior leagues.\n\n====Other regions====\nThe [[Australian Ice Hockey League]] and [[New Zealand Ice Hockey League]] are represented by nine and five teams respectively. As of 2012, the two top teams of the previous season from each league compete in the [[Trans-Tasman Champions League]].\n\n[[Ice hockey in Africa]] is a small but growing sport; while no African ice hockey playing nation has a domestic national leagues, there are several regional leagues in [[South Africa]].\n\n===National team competitions===\n[[File:OvechkinKuba2010WinterOlympics.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian men's hockey team]] moves the puck as [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|Czech Republic's]] [[Filip Kuba]] defends against him, during the 2010 Olympics]]\nIce hockey has been played at the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] since 1924 (and was played at the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|summer games in 1920]]). Hockey is Canada's national winter sport, and Canadians are extremely passionate about the game. The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The USSR won all but two gold medals from [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] to [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. The United States won its first gold medal in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]]. On the way to winning the gold medal at the [[1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Lake Placid Olympics]], amateur US college players defeated the heavily favoured Soviet squad\u2014an event known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the United States. Restrictions on professional players were fully dropped at the 1988 games in Calgary. NHL agreed to participate ten years later. 1998 Games saw the full participation of players from the NHL, which suspended operations during the Games and has done so in subsequent Games up until 2018. The [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games in Vancouver]] were the first played in an NHL city since the inclusion of NHL players. The 2010 games were the first played on NHL-sized ice rinks, which are narrower than the IIHF standard.\n\nNational teams representing the member federations of the IIHF compete annually in the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships. Teams are selected from the available players by the individual federations, without restriction on amateur or professional status. Since it is held in the spring, the tournament coincides with the annual NHL Stanley Cup playoffs and many of the top players are hence not available to participate in the tournament. Many of the NHL players who do play in the IIHF tournament come from teams eliminated before the playoffs or in the first round, and federations often hold open spots until the tournament to allow for players to join the tournament after their club team is eliminated. For many years, the tournament was an amateur-only tournament, but this restriction was removed, beginning in 1977.\n[[File:IIHF16WC - Game FIN v BLR.jpg|thumb|Skaters from the [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finnish]] and [[Belarus men's national ice hockey team|Belorussian men's ice hockey teams]] shortly after a [[face-off]] during the [[2016 IIHF World Championship]]. The IIHF is an annual national team tournament.]]\nThe [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] and [[1974 Summit Series]], two series pitting the best Canadian and [[Soviet]] players without IIHF restrictions were major successes, and established a rivalry between Canada and the USSR. In the spirit of best-versus-best without restrictions on amateur or professional status, the series were followed by five [[Canada Cup (ice hockey)|Canada Cup]] tournaments, played in North America. Two NHL versus USSR series were also held: the 1979 Challenge Cup and [[Rendez-vous '87]]. The Canada Cup tournament later became the World Cup of Hockey, played in 1996, 2004 and 2016. The United States won in 1996 and Canada won in 2004 and 2016.\n\nSince the initial women's world championships in 1990, there have been fifteen tournaments.<ref name=\"IIHF WWC list\" /> Women's hockey has been played at the Olympics since 1998.<ref name=\"Hunter 1998 Olympics\" /> The only finals in the women's world championship or Olympics that did not involve both Canada and the United States were the [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006 Winter Olympic final]] between Canada and Sweden and [[2019 IIHF Women's World Championship Final|2019 World Championship final]] between the US and Finland.\n\nOther ice hockey tournaments featuring national teams include the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World U20 Championship]], the [[IIHF World U18 Championships|World U18 Championships]], the [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the [[World Junior A Challenge]], the [[Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament]], the [[IIHF World Women's U18 Championships|World Women's U18 Championships]] and the [[4 Nations Cup]]. The annual [[Euro Hockey Tour]], an unofficial European championship between the national men's teams of the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden have been played since 1996\u201397.\n\n===Attendance records===\n{{Main|List of ice hockey games with highest attendance}}\n[[File:TheBigChillattheBigHouse.JPG|thumb|[[The Big Chill at the Big House]] was a collegiate ice hockey game played at [[Michigan Stadium]] in 2010.

Pond hockey is commonly referred to in hockey circles as shinny. Its rules differ from traditional hockey because there is no hitting and very little shooting, placing a greater emphasis on skating, puckhandling and passing abilities. Since 2002, the [[World Pond Hockey Championship]] has been played on Roulston Lake in [[Plaster Rock]], New Brunswick, Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the World Pond Hockey Championship |url=http://worldpondhockey.ca/en/home/history |website=worldpondhockey.ca |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref> Since 2006, the [[US Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the [[Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships]] have been played in Huntsville, Ontario.\n\n===Sledge hockey===\n{{Main|Sledge hockey}}\nSledge hockey is an adaption of ice hockey designed for players who have a physical disability.
