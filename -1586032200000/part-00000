The golden turtle first appeared during the reign of King [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (257-207 BC) and assisted the king in the construction of defenses for the ancient capital of [[Co Loa Thanh|Co Loa]]. When Co Loa was attacked, Kim Qui assisted the king in making a magical cross-bow that massively rained arrows upon the invaders in only a single shot. When the King's daughter conspired against her father, Kim Qui emerged again to inform An Duong Vuong of the betrayal; the king consequently killed his daughter and drowned himself in the sea.<ref name=vnn>{{cite web|publisher=VietNamNet Bridge|year=2005|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2005/04/406255/|title=Hoan Kiem Lake Turtle: from myth to reality|accessdate=2006-12-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207214309/http://english.vietnamnet.vn/features/2005/04/406255/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2006-12-07}}</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, a gentry named [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]] obtained a magical sword named [[Heaven's Will]] that a fisherman had pulled out of the lake.

The Franks started buying slaves from the Slavs and [[Avar Khaganate]] while Muslims also came across slaves in the form of [[mercenaries]] serving the [[Byzantine Empire]] and settlers in addition to among the [[Khazars]]. While the trade was dominated by Jewish merchants until 9th century and [[Italian city states]], most Slavic slaves were imported to the [[Muslim world]] through the border between Christian and Islamic kingdoms where castration centres were also located instead of the direct route. From there they were sent into Islamic Spain and other Muslim-ruled regions especially [[North Africa]]. The saqaliba gained popularity in Umayyad Spain especially as warriors. After the collapse of the Umayyads, they also came to rule over many of the [[taifas]].

Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.

The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers.

From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]], [[Ireland]] were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later.

Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive, but not obliged to work; the most famous of these was the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was held for almost five years. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Attractive women or boys could be used as [[sex slaves]]. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.<ref>Diego de Haedo, ''Topograf\u00eda e historia general de Argel'', 3 vols., Madrid, 1927-29.</ref><ref>Daniel Eisenberg, \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 volvi\u00f3 Cervantes de Argel?\", in ''Ingeniosa invenci\u00f3n: Essays on Golden Age Spanish Literature for Geoffrey L.

They imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the [[Reconquista]] in the late 15th century. The slaves were exported from the Christian section of Spain, as well as Eastern Europe, sparking significant reaction from many in Christian Spain and many Christians still living in Muslim Spain. Soon after, Muslims were successful, taking 30,000 Christian captives from Spain. In the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to \"frequent cross-border skirmishes, interspersed between periods of major campaigns\". By the tenth century, in the eastern Mediterranean Byzantine, Christians were captured by Muslims. Many of the raids designed by Muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners. Therefore, Muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing. The Iberian peninsula served as a base for further exports of slaves into other Muslim regions in Northern Africa.<ref name=\"Constable\">Trade and traders in Muslim Spain, Fourth Series, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996.</ref>\n\n===Ottoman slave trade===\n{{main article|Ottoman slave trade}}\n\nSlavery was a legal and a significant part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s economy and society.<ref>[http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html Supply of Slaves]</ref> The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa, Eastern Europe, and [[Circassia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the Caucasus.

''Damnati in metallum'' (\"those condemned to the mine\") were convicts who lost their freedom as citizens (''libertas''), forfeited their property (''bona'') to the state, and became ''servi poenae'', slaves as a legal penalty. Their status under the law was different from that of other slaves; they could not buy their freedom, be sold, or be set free. They were expected to live and die in the mines.<ref>Alfred Michael Hirt, ''Imperial Mines and Quarries in the Roman World: Organizational Aspects 27\u2013BC&nbsp;AD&nbsp;235'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2010), sect.&nbsp;3.3.</ref> Imperial slaves and freedmen (the ''familia Caesaris)'' worked in mine administration and management.<ref>Hirt, ''Imperial Mines and Quarries'', sect. 4.2.1.</ref>\n\nIn the Late Republic, about half the [[gladiator]]s who fought in Roman arenas were slaves, though the most skilled were often free volunteers.<ref>Alison Futrell, ''A Sourcebook on the Roman Games'' (Blackwell, 2006), p.&nbsp;124.</ref> Successful gladiators were occasionally rewarded with freedom.

This has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three imperial-era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only one individual came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another two possibly did, but results are inconclusive. In the rest of the Italian peninsula, the fraction of non European slaves was much lower than that.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Isotopic evidence for age-related immigration to imperial Rome| doi=10.1002/ajpa.20541 | pmid=17205550 | volume=132| issue=4 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|pages=510\u2013519|year = 2007|last1 = Prowse|first1 = Tracy L.| last2=Schwarcz | first2=Henry P. | last3=Garnsey | first3=Peter | last4=Knyf | first4=Martin | last5=MacChiarelli | first5=Roberto | last6=Bondioli | first6=Luca }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Killgrove and Montgomery. \"All Roads Lead to Rome: Exploring Human Migration to the Eternal City through Biochemistry of Skeletons from Two Imperial-Era Cemeteries (1st-3rd c AD)\".  | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147585 | pmid=26863610 | pmc=4749291 | volume=11| issue=2 |journal=PLOS ONE|page=e0147585|year = 2016|last1 = Killgrove|first1 = Kristina| last2=Montgomery | first2=Janet }}</ref>\n\n===Slavery under Islamic rule===\n{{Social structure in the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}\n{{main article|History of slavery in the Muslim world|Slavery in the Ottoman Empire}}\nThe \"pen\u00e7ik\" or \"pen\u00e7-yek\" tax, meaning \"one fifth\", was a taxation based on a verse of the Quran; whereby one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to [[God in Islam|God]], to [[Muhammad]] and his [[Family tree of Muhammad|family]], to orphans, to those in need and to travelers.

The route functioned concurrently with the [[Dnieper]] trade route, better known as the [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], and lost its importance in the 11th century.\n\n[[Saqaliba]] originally was used to denote [[Slavs|Slavic]] people, however later it came to denote all European slaves in some Muslim regions like Spain including those abducted from raids on Christian kingdoms of Spain. The Franks started buying slaves from the Slavs and [[Avar Khaganate]] while Muslims also came across slaves in the form of [[mercenaries]] serving the [[Byzantine Empire]] and settlers in addition to among the [[Khazars]]. While the trade was dominated by Jewish merchants until 9th century and [[Italian city states]], most Slavic slaves were imported to the [[Muslim world]] through the border between Christian and Islamic kingdoms where castration centres were also located instead of the direct route. From there they were sent into Islamic Spain and other Muslim-ruled regions especially [[North Africa]]. The saqaliba gained popularity in Umayyad Spain especially as warriors. After the collapse of the Ummayads, they also came to rule over many of the [[taifas]].

They imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the [[Reconquista]] in the late 15th century.

Soon after, Muslims were successful, taking 30,000 Christian captives from Spain. In the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to \"frequent cross-border skirmishes, interspersed between periods of major campaigns\". By the tenth century, in the eastern Mediterranean Byzantine, Christians were captured by Muslims. Many of the raids designed by Muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners. Therefore, Muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing.

The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].\n\nThe work of gender researchers like Daniel Arnaud,{{sfn|Arnaud|1973|pp=111-115}} Julia Assante{{sfn|Assante|2003}} and Stephanie Budin{{sfn|Budin|2008}} has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt.

Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, \"I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]\".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.{{sfn|Herodotus|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 vol.1 p.199]}}</blockquote>\n\nThe British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890\u20131915),<ref>{{harvnb|Frazer|1922|loc=abridged ed. [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]}}; see also the more extensive treatment {{harvnb|Frazer|1914|loc=3rd ed. volumes 5 and 6}}. Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by {{harvnb|Henriques|1961|loc=vol. I, ch. 1}}</ref> and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.{{sfn|Henriques|1961|loc=vol. I, ch. 1}} However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150\u2013500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.<ref>[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].</ref> This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did.\n\nIn [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected. The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.{{sfn|Qualls-Corbett|1988|p=37}}\n\n===Sumer===\nThrough the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite (''[[hieros gamos]]'') was staged between the kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] and the high priestesses of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, later called [[Ishtar]].

She did not require a man to give her a sense of her own identity; rather this was rooted in her own womanliness.\"{{sfn|Qualls-Corbett|1988|p=40}} Qualls also equated censuring sacred prostitution to demonize female sexuality and vitality. \"In her temple, men and women came to find life and all that it had to offer in sensual pleasure and delight.

Some scholars prefer the terms \"'''sacred sex'''\" or \"'''sacred sexual rites'''\" to \"sacred prostitution\" in cases where payment for services was not involved.\n\nThe historicity of literal sacred prostitution, particularly in some places and periods, is a controversial topic within the academic world.{{sfn|Cooper|1971|pp=18-19}} Mainstream historiography has traditionally considered it a probable historical reality, based on the abundance of ancient sources and chroniclers detailing its rites, while some modern [[Gender studies|gender researchers]] challenge those views as mistranslations and cultural slander.<ref name=\"Schulz\"/>{{sfn|Stol|2016|pp=419-435}} Regardless of its historicity, the myth of sacred prostitution has been adopted as a sign of distinction by [[sex workers]], [[modern pagans]] and practitioners of [[sex magic]].<ref name=Avar/>{{sfn|Qualls-Corbett|1988|pp=14,24}}<ref name=Pike/>\n\n==Ancient Near East==\n[[File:Ishtar vase Louvre AO17000-detail.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Inanna]] depicted wearing the ceremonial [[headdress]] of the [[high priestess]]]]\n[[Ancient Near East]]ern societies along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers featured many shrines and temples or ''houses of heaven'' dedicated to various [[deities]]. The 5th-century BC historian Herodotus's account and some other testimony from the [[Hellenistic Period]] and [[Late Antiquity]] suggest that ancient societies encouraged the practice of sacred sexual rites not only in [[Babylonia]] and [[Cyprus]], but throughout the [[Near East]].\n\nThe work of gender researchers like Daniel Arnaud,{{sfn|Arnaud|1973|pp=111-115}} Julia Assante{{sfn|Assante|2003}} and Stephanie Budin{{sfn|Budin|2008}} has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth, arguing taxatively that the practices described in the sources were misunderstandings of either non-remunerated [[ritual sex]] or non-sexual religious ceremonies, possibly even mere cultural slander.<ref name = \"Budin\"/> Although popular in modern times, this view has not gone without being criticized in its methodological approach,{{sfn|Rickard|2015}} including accusations of an ideological agenda.<ref name=Avar/> A more nuanced view espoused by Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, who also called for caution on Budin's categorical denial, suggests that some form of temple prostitution might have existed in the Near East, though not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pirenne-Delforge |first1=Vinciane |title=Review of: The Myth of Sacred Prostitution in Antiquity |url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2009/2009-04-28.html |website=Bryn Mawr Classical Review |accessdate=30 August 2019 |date=April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Babylonia===\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the [[rite]]s performed at these temples included sexual intercourse, or what scholars later called sacred sexual rites:\n\n<blockquote>The foulest Babylonian custom is that which compels every woman of the land to sit in the temple of [[Aphrodite]] and have intercourse with some stranger at least once in her life. Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants.  But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice.  Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, \"I invite you in the name of [[Mylitta]]\".  It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.{{sfn|Herodotus|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+1.199 vol.1 p.199]}}</blockquote>\n\nThe British anthropologist [[James Frazer]] accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890\u20131915),<ref>{{harvnb|Frazer|1922|loc=abridged ed. [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]}}; see also the more extensive treatment {{harvnb|Frazer|1914|loc=3rd ed. volumes 5 and 6}}. Frazer's argument and citations are reproduced in slightly clearer fashion by {{harvnb|Henriques|1961|loc=vol. I, ch. 1}}</ref> and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public [[defloration]] of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite.{{sfn|Henriques|1961|loc=vol. I, ch. 1}} However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of [[Late Antiquity]] (i.e. 150\u2013500 AD), not from the Classical or [[Hellenistic period]]s.<ref>[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] are the only sources mentioned by Frazer that were active prior to the 2nd century AD; his other sources include [[Deipnosophistae|Athenaeus]], [[De Dea Syria|pseudo-Lucian]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], and the Christian church historians [[Sozomen]] and [[Socrates of Constantinople]].</ref> This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did.\n\nIn [[code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi's code of laws]], the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected. The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.{{sfn|Qualls-Corbett|1988|p=37}}\n\n===Sumer===\nThrough the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of sacred marriage rite (''[[hieros gamos]]'') was staged between the kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of [[Sumer]] and the high priestesses of [[Inanna]], the [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian goddess]] of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, later called [[Ishtar]]. The king would couple with the priestess to represent the union of [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] with [[Inanna]].<ref name=Day_2004>{{harvnb|Day|2004|pp=2\u201321}}</ref> According to the noted Assyriologist [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], the kings would further establish their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival [[Akitu]].{{sfn|Kramer|1969}}\n\nHowever, no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included, despite many popular descriptions of the habit.{{sfn|Frazer|1922|loc=[[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]}} It is possible that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess [[Ishtar]] often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god [[Utu]], and receiving a royal crown from [[Anu|An]], all in a single day.{{sfn|Sweet|1994|pp=85\u2013104}} Some modern historians argue in the same direction,<ref name=\"Budin\" />{{sfn|Assante|2003|pp=13\u201347}}{{sfn|Yamauchi1973|pp=213\u2013222}} though their posture has been disputed.<ref name=Day_2004 />\n\n===Hittites===\nThe [[Hittites]] practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.{{sfn|Singh|1997|p=6}}\n\n===Phoenicia===\nAt the Etruscan site of [[Pyrgi]], a center of worship of the eastern goddess [[Astarte]], archaeologists identified a temple consecrated to her and built with at least 17 small rooms that may have served as quarters for temple prostitutes.<ref name=St>Biblical Archaeology Society Staff, [https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/sacred-prostitution-in-the-story-of-judah-and-tamar/ Sacred Prostitution in the Story of Judah and Tamar?], 7 August 2018</ref> Similarly, a temple dedicated to her equated goddess [[Atargatis]] in [[Dura-Europos]], was found with nearly a dozen small rooms with low benches, which might have used either for sacred meals or sacred services of women jailed in the temple for adultery.<ref name=St/><ref name=Lipinski2013>{{harvnb|Lipi\u0144ski|2013|pp=9\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] uses two different words for prostitute, ''zonah'' (\u05d6\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4)&lrm;<ref name=\"zanah\">Associated with the corresponding verb ''zanah''.{{cite web|title=Genesis 1:1 (KJV)|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&strongs=h2181|website=[[Blue Letter Bible]]|accessdate=5 April 2018}} incorporating [[Strong's concordance]] (1890) and [[Gesenius]]'s Lexicon (1857).

She did not require a man to give her a sense of her own identity; rather this was rooted in her own womanliness.\"{{sfn|Qualls-Corbett|1988|p=40}} Qualls also equated censuring sacred prostitution to demonize female sexuality and vitality. \"In her temple, men and women came to find life and all that it had to offer in sensual pleasure and delight.

He began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], making his debut in 1972. He made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove. The house also had no central heating leading to \"very harsh\" nights in winter.<ref name=\"dl1819\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> His parents had met and married in [[Tonypandy]] where his father had worked as a miner. In the hope of improving their prospects, the pair moved to Cardiff where his father found work at a [[foundry]] in [[Tremorfa]]. His mother, Constance, also took up work in the canteen of an aluminium manufacturing factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDwyer was the fifth child born to his parents. He had three older brothers, Brian, Kenny and Peter, and an older sister, Maureen. His siblings were significantly older than Dwyer and his brothers had already moved out of the family home by the time he was born.<ref name=\"dl1819\"/> Of his three brothers, Kenny died at the age of 36 from diabetes,<ref name=\"dl1819\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=nLdRsWYvKEND5wzucfk16A&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=29 February 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Peter joined the armed forces. His other, Brian, was a keen sportsman and played football at amateur level for local side St Patrick's. He also represented Wales at boxing at the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]].<ref name=\"dl1819\"/>\n\nAs a child, Dwyer attended St. Patrick's Primary School where he joined the school band as a drummer.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=21}}</ref> As his family was relatively poor, he and his friends would often steal fruit and vegetables from gardens and, on one occasion, he was caught shoplifting by a policeman.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=24}}</ref> He took up numerous sporting activities in his youth, including cricket, rugby and baseball, but was most keen on football, idolising [[Billy Bremner]] and [[George Best]]. Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Football career==\n\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time. He gained international recognition soon after when he was slecetes to represent Wales at under-15 level in the [[Victory Shield]], a youth competition held between the [[Home Nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Depsite this, he initially struggled to attract interest from clubs until he was invited to train with the youth team at Cardiff City by Harry Parsons, a long serving employee of the club. Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final. Cardiff held Arsenal to a goalless draw in the first leg before losing the return fixture 2\u20130 at Ninian Park.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=49\u201351}}</ref>\n\nOn his 18th birthday, Dwyer was offered his first professional contract with the club by manager [[Jimmy Scoular]], earning \u00a320 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=53}}</ref> With Cardiff struggling in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] during the 1972\u201373 season, Dwyer became increasingly involved in the first team as Scoular attempted to improve the side's fortunes. On 7 October 1972, Scoular dropped [[David Carver]] from the side and handed Dwyer his professional debut against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/10/30/phil-dwyer-banned-from-driving-91466-22149335/ |title=Phil Dwyer banned from driving |publisher=[[South Wales Echo]] |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> Playing as a [[Rightback|right-back]], he helped the side record a goalless draw, having been reduced to ten men when [[Alan Foggon]] had been sent off after 30 minutes. Dwyer remained in the first team for the remainder of the season, helping the side narrowly avoid relegation with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the final match of the campaign. Despite the team's disappointing league form, Dwyer ended the season by winning his first senior trophy as Cardiff defeated [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]] 5\u20130 in the final of the [[Welsh Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=60\u201362}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975 Dwyer, who would go on to break the club's appearance record, came close to never playing for the club again. While playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], he collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the players knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact had forced Dwyer to swallow his tongue and he stopped breathing before Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway, and save his life, by using the corner flag pole. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. However, Dwyer was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].\n\nHis final appearance for the club came on 17 March 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Following the match, Dwyer lambasted several of his teammates after believing that they had given up during the game. His outburst led manager [[Alan Durban]] to drop Dwyer from the side and inform him that he was no longer needed at the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Durban Packed Me off to Rochdale after My City Rant - Dwyer |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Rival South Wales clubs [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] showed interest in signing him, although Durban did not inform Dwyer of their interest.

28 October 1953) is a Welsh former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]]. He began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], making his debut in 1972. He made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove. The house also had no central heating leading to \"very harsh\" nights in winter.<ref name=\"dl1819\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> His parents had met and married in [[Tonypandy]] where his father had worked as a miner. In the hope of improving their prospects, the pair moved to Cardiff where his father found work at a [[foundry]] in [[Tremorfa]]. His mother, Constance, also took up work in the canteen of an aluminium manufacturing factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDwyer was the fifth child born to his parents. He had three older brothers, Brian, Kenny and Peter, and an older sister, Maureen. His siblings were significantly older than Dwyer and his brothers had already moved out of the family home by the time he was born.<ref name=\"dl1819\"/> Of his three brothers, Kenny died at the age of 36 from diabetes,<ref name=\"dl1819\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=nLdRsWYvKEND5wzucfk16A&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=29 February 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Peter joined the armed forces. His other, Brian, was a keen sportsman and played football at amateur level for local side St Patrick's. He also represented Wales at boxing at the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]].<ref name=\"dl1819\"/>\n\nAs a child, Dwyer attended St. Patrick's Primary School where he joined the school band as a drummer.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=21}}</ref> As his family was relatively poor, he and his friends would often steal fruit and vegetables from gardens and, on one occasion, he was caught shoplifting by a policeman.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=24}}</ref> He took up numerous sporting activities in his youth, including cricket, rugby and baseball, but was most keen on football, idolising [[Billy Bremner]] and [[George Best]]. Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Football career==\n\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time. He gained international recognition soon after when he was slecetes to represent Wales at under-15 level in the [[Victory Shield]], a youth competition held between the [[Home Nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Depsite this, he initially struggled to attract interest from clubs until he was invited to train with the youth team at Cardiff City by Harry Parsons, a long serving employee of the club. Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final. Cardiff held Arsenal to a goalless draw in the first leg before losing the return fixture 2\u20130 at Ninian Park.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=49\u201351}}</ref>\n\nOn his 18th birthday, Dwyer was offered his first professional contract with the club by manager [[Jimmy Scoular]], earning \u00a320 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=53}}</ref> With Cardiff struggling in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] during the 1972\u201373 season, Dwyer became increasingly involved in the first team as Scoular attempted to improve the side's fortunes. On 7 October 1972, Scoular dropped [[David Carver]] from the side and handed Dwyer his professional debut against [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/10/30/phil-dwyer-banned-from-driving-91466-22149335/ |title=Phil Dwyer banned from driving |publisher=[[South Wales Echo]] |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> Playing as a [[Rightback|right-back]], he helped the side record a goalless draw, having been reduced to ten men when [[Alan Foggon]] had been sent off after 30 minutes. Dwyer remained in the first team for the remainder of the season, helping the side narrowly avoid relegation with a 1\u20131 draw against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the final match of the campaign. Despite the team's disappointing league form, Dwyer ended the season by winning his first senior trophy as Cardiff defeated [[Bangor City F.C.|Bangor City]] 5\u20130 in the final of the [[Welsh Cup]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=60\u201362}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975 Dwyer, who would go on to break the club's appearance record, came close to never playing for the club again. While playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], he collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the players knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact had forced Dwyer to swallow his tongue and he stopped breathing before Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway, and save his life, by using the corner flag pole. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. However, Dwyer was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].\n\nHis final appearance for the club came on 17 March 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Following the match, Dwyer lambasted several of his teammates after believing that they had given up during the game. His outburst led manager [[Alan Durban]] to drop Dwyer from the side and inform him that he was no longer needed at the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Durban Packed Me off to Rochdale after My City Rant - Dwyer |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Rival South Wales clubs [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] showed interest in signing him, although Durban did not inform Dwyer of their interest.

Dingbats are not part of the text.]]\n\nIn typography, a '''dingbat''' (sometimes more formally known as a '''printer's ornament''' or '''printer's character''') is an [[ornament (art)|ornament]], character, or spacer used in [[typesetting]], often employed for the creation of box frames (similar to [[box-drawing character]]s). The term continues to be used in the [[computer]] industry to describe [[Typeface|fonts]] that have symbols and shapes in the positions designated for alphabetical or numeric characters.\n\nExamples of characters included in Unicode ([[ITC Zapf Dingbats]] series 100 and others):\n\n{| class=\"Unicode\" style=\"font-size:larger;\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;||[[Scissors|\u2701]]||\u2702||\u2703||\u2704||[[\u2705]]||[[\u2706]]||[[\u2707]]||[[\u2708]]||[[\u2709]]||[[\u261b]]||\u261e||[[\u270c]]||[[\u270d]]||[[\u270e]]||\u270f\n|-\n|\u2710||\u2711||[[\u2712]]||[[Tick (checkmark)|\u2713]]||\u2714||[[X mark|\u2715]]||\u2716||\u2717||\u2718||[[\u2719]]||\u271a||\u271b||\u271c||[[Christian cross|\u271d]]||[[Christian cross|\u271e]]||[[Christian cross|\u271f]]\n|-\n|[[Cross patt\u00e9e|\u2720]]||[[Star of David|\u2721]]||[[\u2722]]||\u2723||\u2724||[[\u2725]]||[[\u2726]]||\u2727||[[Star (glyph)|\u2605]]||\u2729||[[\u272a]]||\u272b||[[\u272c]]||\u272d||\u272e||\u272f\n|-\n|\u2730||[[\u2731]]||\u2732||\u2733||\u2734||\u2735||\u2736||\u2737||\u2738||\u2739||[[Starburst (symbol)|\u273a]]||\u273b||\u273c||\u273d||\u273e||[[\u273f]]\n|-\n|[[\u2740]]||[[\u2741]]||\u2742||\u2743||[[\u2744]]||[[\u2745]]||[[\u2746]]||\u2747||\u2748||\u2749||\u274a||\u274b||\u25cf||\u274d||\u25a0||\u274f\n|-\n|[[\u263a]]||\u263b||[[\u2665]]||[[\u2666]]||[[\u2663]]||[[\u2660]]||\u2022||\u25d8||[[\u25cb]]||\u2750||\u2751||\u2752||[[\u25b2]]||\u25bc||[[\u25c6]]||\u2756\n|-\n|[[\u25d7]]||[[\u2758]]||\u2759||\u275a||[[\u275b]]||[[\u275c]]||[[\u275d]]||[[\u275e]]||&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe advent of [[Unicode]] and the [[universal character set]] it provides allowed commonly used dingbats to be given their own [[Code point|character codes]]. Although [[fonts]] claiming Unicode coverage will contain [[glyph]]s for dingbats ''in addition to'' alphabetic characters, fonts that have dingbats ''in place of'' alphabetic characters continue to be popular, primarily for ease of [[Unicode#Input methods|input]].  Such fonts are also sometimes known as ''pi fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/PiFontInfo.pdf|title=Fonts by Adobe|work=adobe.com}}</ref>\n\nSome of the dingbat symbols have been used as [[signature mark]]s, used in [[bookbinding]] to order sections.\n\n=={{anchor|Unicode}}Dingbats Unicode block==\n<!-- Emoji article and Template:Unicode chart Dingbats both link to this section.
