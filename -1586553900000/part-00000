Immediately after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] around 200,000 Cubans came to South Florida. Of these emigrants many were collaborators in the recently toppled [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime, of the middle or upper class, and of European descent. Many emigrants believed their exile was temporary since [[Fidel Castro]] would soon be toppled. Travel between the United States and Cuba was not heavily restricted even in the wake of the recent revolution. In 1960 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which offered public services to Cuban emigrants. Many immigration restrictions were specifically waived for Cubans entering the United States.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\nMany of these original Cuban exiles were involved in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] which failed to topple [[Fidel Castro]].

This indeed happened later with the \"Escuelas al Campo\" project. Cuban children were separated from their parents and sent to labor camps known as IPUEC (Instituto Preuniversitario en el Campo), to be indoctrinated in Marxist ideals. Between November 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 children were sent to the U.S. by their parents in [[Operation Peter Pan]]. These children were taken under the care of the Catholic Church and placed in foster homes throughout the U.S until they could be reunited with their parents. Their parents sent them into the U.S in order to keep them from communist indoctrination, with many boys being sent to avoid getting drafted into the [[Cuban armed forces]], and girls being put into the greatly politized [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Alphabetization Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/ancien-espion-cia-cuba-raconte-sa-vie-echecs-477961.html|title=Un ancien espion de la CIA \u00e0 Cuba raconte sa vie \"d'\u00e9checs\" - Outre-mer la 1\u00e8re|author=|date=|website=francetvinfo.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Camarioca boatlift===\nOn September 28, 1965, Fidel Castro announced that Cubans wishing to emigrate could do so beginning 10 October from the Cuban port of [[Camarioca]]. The administration of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] tried to control the numbers it would admit to the U.S. and set some parameters for their qualifications, preferring those claiming political persecution and those with family members in the U.S. In negotiations with the Cuban government it set a target of 3,000 to 4,000 people to be transported by air. Despite those diplomatic discussions, [[Cuban Americans]] brought small leisure boats from the United States to Camarioca. In the resulting Camarioca boatlift, about 160 boats transported about 5,000 refugees to Key West for immigration processing by U.S. officials. The Johnson administration made only modest efforts to enforce restrictions on this boat traffic. Castro closed the port with little notice on November 15, stranding thousands. On November 6, the Cuban and U.S. governments agreed on the details on an emigration airlift based on family reunification and without reference to those the U.S. characterized as political prisoners and whom the Cubans termed counter-revolutionaries. To deal with the crowds at Camarioca, the U.S. added a maritime component to the airborne evacuation. Both forms of transport started operating on December 1.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engstrom|first1=David Wells|title=Presidential Decision Making Adrift: The Carter Administration and the Mariel Boatlift|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=24ff|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLhWkTUg5r0C&pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2016|isbn=9780847684144}}</ref><ref>\"Cuban Americans\", by Thomas D.

The mass ''boatlift'' occurred after a number of Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Havana Peruvian Embassy and requested asylum. One embassy guard died as a result of [[friendly fire]] when another guard machine gunned the incoming bus and hit the first one accidentally. When the Peruvian ambassador refused to return the exiled citizens to the authorities, Castro removed the Cuban guards from the embassy, basically opening the door to the 4,000 plus asylum seekers that came into the embassy within the next few days. Reacting to this sudden exodus, Castro stated, \"Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can do so\" and declared that those who were leaving the country were the \"escoria\" (scum).\n\nThis resulted in an even larger exodus through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]], where an improvised flotilla of Cuban exiles from Miami in small pleasure boats and commercial shrimping vessels brought Cuban citizens who wished to leave the island. Within weeks, 125,000 Cubans reached the United States despite [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] attempts to prevent boats from leaving U.S. waters for Cuba. As the exodus became international news and an embarrassment for the Cuban government, Castro emptied his hospitals and had prison inmates rounded up as \"social undesirables\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_exiles.html |title=American Experience &#124; Fidel Castro &#124; People & Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last= Cockburn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html |title=Criminals 'in exodus from Cuba': US fears Castro emptying his jails - into Florida |publisher=The Independent |date= 28 August 1994 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> and included them among the other refugees. The Cuban Communist Party staged meetings at the homes of those known to be leaving the country.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} People were intimidated by these \"repudiation meetings\" (mitines de repudio), where the participants screamed obscenities and defiled the facades of the homes, throwing eggs and garbage, for hours. Labeled as \"traitors to the revolution\" those who declared their wish to leave became the targeted victims of the attacks, their rationing cards were taken from them, their jobs were terminated, or they were expelled from schools or universities. Towards the end of the crisis, the repudiation meetings were ended. The scale of the exodus created political difficulties for the Cuban government, and an agreement was reached to end the boatlift after several months. Out of more than 125,000 refugees, a number from as low as 7,500 to as high as 40,000 were believed to have criminal records in Cuba, though many of their crimes would not qualify as crimes under U.S. law. Some 1,774 of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis. The majority of refugees were young adult males, 20 to 34 years of age, from the working class: skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled tradesmen, and unskilled laborers. In 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated an agreement to resume normal immigration and to return to Cuba those persons who had arrived during the boatlift who were \"excludable\" under U.S. law.\n\n===Balseros===\n{{Main|Balseros (rafters)}} {{Further|1994 Cuban rafter crisis|Wet feet, dry feet policy}}\nDuring the past years, exile waves have consisted of ''[[balseros (rafters)|balseros]]'', who travel in homemade rafts. On 18 August 1994, U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said in a press release:<ref>{{cite web|title=Attorney General's Statement on Cuban Influx|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/August94/474.txt.html|website=[[United States Department of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|To divert the Cuban people from seeking democratic change, the government of Cuba has resorted to an unconscionable tactic of letting people risk their lives by leaving in flimsy vessels through the treacherous waters of the Florida Straits. Many people have lost their lives in such crossings. We urge the people of Cuba to remain home and not to fall for this callous maneuver. I want to work with all concerned including the Cuban American community to make sure the message goes out to Cubans that putting a boat or raft to sea means putting life and limb at risk... To prevent this from happening again, the Coast Guard has mounted an aggressive public information campaign so people know that vessels... may be stopped and boarded and may be seized. Individuals who violate U.S. law will be prosecuted in appropriate circumstances.}}\n\nPresident Clinton, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed a dozen Latin American governments to provide internment camps that officials hoped would prove more attractive to refugees than the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Although the refugees at Guantanamo were held behind barbed wire, to many, the base was less forbidding than a foreign internment camp.\n\nAs a result of bilateral migration accords between the two governments, in September 1994 and May 1995, the status quo of U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The U.S. granted Cuba an annual minimum of 20,000 legal immigrant visas and, at the same time, determined that Cubans picked up at sea would be sent home just as any other group of illegal immigrants. President Clinton's agreement with Cuba resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then at Guantanamo. This new agreement had two new points. The United States agreed to take most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo through the humanitarian parole provision. Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum quota of 20,000 migrants from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over the years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in a camp, the United States began sending them back to Cuba. Both governments promised to follow international agreements to ensure that no action would be taken against the people returned to Cuba.\n\nAs a result of these migration agreements and interdiction policy, a \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice toward Cuban immigrants has developed. Those who do not reach dry land are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution there, but only those who meet the definition of asylum refugee are accepted for eventual resettlement in a third country. Those Cuban rafters who do reach land are inspected by [[Department of Homeland Security]] and usually are allowed to stay in the United States. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in eleven different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. Since March 2003  the State Department has not been allowed to monitor the treatment of the immigrants returned to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot was abruptly ended by [[President Obama]] days before he ended his second term in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|first = Alan |last =Gomez|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/12/obama-ends-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-cubans/96505172/|title=Obama ends 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans|date=12 January 2017|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> which sparked controversy for the Cuban Exile community <ref>NPR, \"Cuban-Americans React To Obama Ending Longstanding 'Wet Foot, Dry Foot' Policy\" [https://www.npr.org/2017/01/13/509722747/cuban-americans-react-to-obama-ending-longstanding-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy]</ref>\n\n===Cuban Thaw and aftermath===\n{{Main|Cuban Thaw}}\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] announced he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014.

He also states that as the Cuban exile progressed since 1959 more and more economically disenfranchised Cubans became part of the emigrant waves.

The acceptance of Cuban emigrants during the [[Freedom Flights]] was done in hopes of weakening the Cuban economy by draining it of workers. The United States also was generally able to paint a negative picture of Cuba by participating in the mass emigration of many who disliked Cuba and wished to flee the island. The [[Department of State]] painted Cuban emigrants in the 1960s as freedom seeking refugees. By the [[Mariel boatlift]] the United States had lost its total aggressive foreign policy towards Cuba and instead viewed the island as a nuisance rather than a security threat. The [[Mariel boatlift]] was soon canceled after it was initiated and received little public American support. Fidel Castro benefited from the exile because he was able to remove disloyalty by directly removing disloyal citizens from Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scanlan|first1=John|last2=Loescher|first2=John|title=U.

Immediately after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] around 200,000 Cubans came to South Florida. Of these emigrants many were collaborators in the recently toppled [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] regime, of the middle or upper class, and of European descent. Many emigrants believed their exile was temporary since [[Fidel Castro]] would soon be toppled. Travel between the United States and Cuba was not heavily restricted even in the wake of the recent revolution. In 1960 [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] established the Cuban Refugee Emergency Center which offered public services to Cuban emigrants. Many immigration restrictions were specifically waived for Cubans entering the United States.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\nMany of these original Cuban exiles were involved in the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] which failed to topple [[Fidel Castro]]. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 the Cuban government would restrict air traffic to the island, ending the first major wave of emigration.<ref name=NorthAmerica></ref>\n\n===Operation Peter Pans===\n{{Main|Operation Peter Pan}}\nTo destabilize the communist dictatorship, the CIA and [[Cuban dissident movement|Cubans dissidents]] began warning of a project by the castrist government, to remove the parents' custody of their children to indoctrinate them. This indeed happened later with the \"Escuelas al Campo\" project. Cuban children were separated from their parents and sent to labor camps known as IPUEC (Instituto Preuniversitario en el Campo), to be indoctrinated in Marxist ideals. Between November 1960 and October 1962, over 14,000 children were sent to the U.S. by their parents in [[Operation Peter Pan]]. These children were taken under the care of the Catholic Church and placed in foster homes throughout the U.S until they could be reunited with their parents. Their parents sent them into the U.S in order to keep them from communist indoctrination, with many boys being sent to avoid getting drafted into the [[Cuban armed forces]], and girls being put into the greatly politized [[Cuban Literacy Campaign|Alphabetization Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/ancien-espion-cia-cuba-raconte-sa-vie-echecs-477961.html|title=Un ancien espion de la CIA \u00e0 Cuba raconte sa vie \"d'\u00e9checs\" - Outre-mer la 1\u00e8re|author=|date=|website=francetvinfo.fr}}</ref>\n\n===Camarioca boatlift===\nOn September 28, 1965, Fidel Castro announced that Cubans wishing to emigrate could do so beginning 10 October from the Cuban port of [[Camarioca]]. The administration of U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] tried to control the numbers it would admit to the U.S. and set some parameters for their qualifications, preferring those claiming political persecution and those with family members in the U.S. In negotiations with the Cuban government it set a target of 3,000 to 4,000 people to be transported by air. Despite those diplomatic discussions, [[Cuban Americans]] brought small leisure boats from the United States to Camarioca. In the resulting Camarioca boatlift, about 160 boats transported about 5,000 refugees to Key West for immigration processing by U.S. officials. The Johnson administration made only modest efforts to enforce restrictions on this boat traffic. Castro closed the port with little notice on November 15, stranding thousands. On November 6, the Cuban and U.S. governments agreed on the details on an emigration airlift based on family reunification and without reference to those the U.S. characterized as political prisoners and whom the Cubans termed counter-revolutionaries. To deal with the crowds at Camarioca, the U.S. added a maritime component to the airborne evacuation. Both forms of transport started operating on December 1.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engstrom|first1=David Wells|title=Presidential Decision Making Adrift: The Carter Administration and the Mariel Boatlift|year=1997|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=24ff|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JLhWkTUg5r0C&pg=PA24|accessdate=24 March 2016|isbn=9780847684144}}</ref><ref>\"Cuban Americans\", by Thomas D.

The mass ''boatlift'' occurred after a number of Cubans drove a bus through the gates of the Havana Peruvian Embassy and requested asylum. One embassy guard died as a result of [[friendly fire]] when another guard machine gunned the incoming bus and hit the first one accidentally. When the Peruvian ambassador refused to return the exiled citizens to the authorities, Castro removed the Cuban guards from the embassy, basically opening the door to the 4,000 plus asylum seekers that came into the embassy within the next few days. Reacting to this sudden exodus, Castro stated, \"Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can do so\" and declared that those who were leaving the country were the \"escoria\" (scum).\n\nThis resulted in an even larger exodus through the port of [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]], where an improvised flotilla of Cuban exiles from Miami in small pleasure boats and commercial shrimping vessels brought Cuban citizens who wished to leave the island. Within weeks, 125,000 Cubans reached the United States despite [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] attempts to prevent boats from leaving U.S. waters for Cuba. As the exodus became international news and an embarrassment for the Cuban government, Castro emptied his hospitals and had prison inmates rounded up as \"social undesirables\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_exiles.html |title=American Experience &#124; Fidel Castro &#124; People & Events |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate= 18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last= Cockburn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/criminals-in-exodus-from-cuba-us-fears-castro-emptying-his-jails--into-florida-1386288.html |title=Criminals 'in exodus from Cuba': US fears Castro emptying his jails - into Florida |publisher=The Independent |date= 28 August 1994 |accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> and included them among the other refugees. The Cuban Communist Party staged meetings at the homes of those known to be leaving the country.{{According to whom|date=October 2015}} People were intimidated by these \"repudiation meetings\" (mitines de repudio), where the participants screamed obscenities and defiled the facades of the homes, throwing eggs and garbage, for hours. Labeled as \"traitors to the revolution\" those who declared their wish to leave became the targeted victims of the attacks, their rationing cards were taken from them, their jobs were terminated, or they were expelled from schools or universities. Towards the end of the crisis, the repudiation meetings were ended. The scale of the exodus created political difficulties for the Cuban government, and an agreement was reached to end the boatlift after several months. Out of more than 125,000 refugees, a number from as low as 7,500 to as high as 40,000 were believed to have criminal records in Cuba, though many of their crimes would not qualify as crimes under U.S. law. Some 1,774 of the refugees were classified as serious or violent criminals under U.S. law and denied citizenship on that basis. The majority of refugees were young adult males, 20 to 34 years of age, from the working class: skilled craftsmen, semi-skilled tradesmen, and unskilled laborers. In 1984, the United States and Cuba negotiated an agreement to resume normal immigration and to return to Cuba those persons who had arrived during the boatlift who were \"excludable\" under U.S. law.\n\n===Balseros===\n{{Main|Balseros (rafters)}} {{Further|1994 Cuban rafter crisis|Wet feet, dry feet policy}}\nDuring the past years, exile waves have consisted of ''[[balseros (rafters)|balseros]]'', who travel in homemade rafts. On 18 August 1994, U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said in a press release:<ref>{{cite web|title=Attorney General's Statement on Cuban Influx|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/Pre_96/August94/474.txt.html|website=[[United States Department of Justice]]|accessdate=17 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|To divert the Cuban people from seeking democratic change, the government of Cuba has resorted to an unconscionable tactic of letting people risk their lives by leaving in flimsy vessels through the treacherous waters of the Florida Straits. Many people have lost their lives in such crossings. We urge the people of Cuba to remain home and not to fall for this callous maneuver. I want to work with all concerned including the Cuban American community to make sure the message goes out to Cubans that putting a boat or raft to sea means putting life and limb at risk... To prevent this from happening again, the Coast Guard has mounted an aggressive public information campaign so people know that vessels... may be stopped and boarded and may be seized. Individuals who violate U.S. law will be prosecuted in appropriate circumstances.}}\n\nPresident Clinton, trying to stem the flow of Cuban rafters, pressed a dozen Latin American governments to provide internment camps that officials hoped would prove more attractive to refugees than the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Although the refugees at Guantanamo were held behind barbed wire, to many, the base was less forbidding than a foreign internment camp.\n\nAs a result of bilateral migration accords between the two governments, in September 1994 and May 1995, the status quo of U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants was altered significantly. The U.S. granted Cuba an annual minimum of 20,000 legal immigrant visas and, at the same time, determined that Cubans picked up at sea would be sent home just as any other group of illegal immigrants. President Clinton's agreement with Cuba resolved the dilemma of the approximately 33,000 Cubans then at Guantanamo. This new agreement had two new points. The United States agreed to take most of the Cubans detained at Guantanamo through the humanitarian parole provision. Cuba agreed to credit some of these admissions toward the minimum quota of 20,000 migrants from Cuba, with 5,000 charged annually over the years. Secondly, rather than placing Cubans intercepted at sea in a camp, the United States began sending them back to Cuba. Both governments promised to follow international agreements to ensure that no action would be taken against the people returned to Cuba.\n\nAs a result of these migration agreements and interdiction policy, a \"wet foot/dry foot\" practice toward Cuban immigrants has developed. Those who do not reach dry land are returned to Cuba unless they fear persecution there, but only those who meet the definition of asylum refugee are accepted for eventual resettlement in a third country. Those Cuban rafters who do reach land are inspected by [[Department of Homeland Security]] and usually are allowed to stay in the United States. From May 1995 through July 2003, about 170 Cuban refugees were resettled in eleven different countries, including Spain, Venezuela, Australia, and Nicaragua. Since March 2003  the State Department has not been allowed to monitor the treatment of the immigrants returned to Cuba. The wet foot/dry foot was abruptly ended by [[President Obama]] days before he ended his second term in 2017,<ref>{{cite web|first = Alan |last =Gomez|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/12/obama-ends-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy-cubans/96505172/|title=Obama ends 'wet foot, dry foot' policy for Cubans|date=12 January 2017|website=usatoday.com}}</ref> which sparked controversy for the Cuban Exile community <ref>NPR, \"Cuban-Americans React To Obama Ending Longstanding 'Wet Foot, Dry Foot' Policy\" [https://www.npr.org/2017/01/13/509722747/cuban-americans-react-to-obama-ending-longstanding-wet-foot-dry-foot-policy]</ref>\n\n===Cuban Thaw and aftermath===\n{{Main|Cuban Thaw}}\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] announced he would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014.

He states that many Cuban exiles face cultural and economic challenges resettling in the United States similar to many other American immigrant communities. He also states that as the Cuban exile progressed since 1959 more and more economically disenfranchised Cubans became part of the emigrant waves. These lower class Cuban exiles became noticeable in the [[Freedom Flights]] and especially so in the [[Mariel boatlift]] and [[Balseros (rafters)|balseros]] afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://journals.openedition.org/plc/464|title=Cuban communities in the United States: migration waves, settlement patterns and socioeconomic diversity|author=Jorge Duany|date=1999|website=journals.openedition.org}}</ref>\n\nMaria Torres wrote in the Chicago Tribune that contrary to the Golden exile myth Cubans are not entirely racially white but from various racial backgrounds and at the time the article was written in 1986, Cuban American families statistically earned less money than the average white family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-11-15-8603250989-story.html|title=CUBAN EXILES ARE NOT A BIT GOLDEN|author=Maria Torres|date=1986|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Political motives ===\nAccording to authors John Scanlan and Gilburt Loescher, United States acceptance of Cuban emigrants after the 1959 Cuban Revolution was done in hopes they could help the United States forcibly remove the Fidel Castro government from Cuba. The acceptance of Cuban emigrants during the [[Freedom Flights]] was done in hopes of weakening the Cuban economy by draining it of workers. The United States also was generally able to paint a negative picture of Cuba by participating in the mass emigration of many who disliked Cuba and wished to flee the island. The [[Department of State]] painted Cuban emigrants in the 1960s as freedom seeking refugees. By the [[Mariel boatlift]] the United States had lost its total aggressive foreign policy towards Cuba and instead viewed the island as a nuisance rather than a security threat. The [[Mariel boatlift]] was soon canceled after it was initiated and received little public American support. Fidel Castro benefited from the exile because he was able to remove disloyalty by directly removing disloyal citizens from Cuba.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scanlan|first1=John|last2=Loescher|first2=John|title=U.

Greenhill argues that the [[1994 Cuban rafter crisis]] was in part engineered by the Cuban government to push social problems out of Cuba and threaten the creation of a humanitarian crisis for the [[United States]]. This threat would stimulate fears of Cuban immigrants in the United States as was seen previously during the Mariel boatlift and would be able to change United States policy towards Cuba in Cuba's favor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Kelly|title=Engineered Migration and the Use of Refugees as Political Weapons: A Case Study of the 1994 Cuban Balseros Crisis\u2020|journal=International Migration|volume=40|issue=4|pages=39\u201374|year=2002|doi=10.1111/1468-2435.00205}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cuba}}\n* [[Cuba-United States relations]]\n* [[Cuban-American lobby]]\n* [[Opposition to Fidel Castro]]\n* [[Vietnamese boat people]]\n* [[North Korean defectors]]\n* [[Venezuelan refugee crisis]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Miguel A.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation.

Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

Helen tells Navarro Wendy and Marty are liabilities and Navarro tells her to do what she thinks best. Darlene persuades Nix to get Ben released in exchange for Nix's deputies not being included in Darlene's drug business. Ben goes to Helen's house, where he confronts Helen and Erin about Helen's illegal activities.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 29\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = Fire Pink\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Miki Johnson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = In a taxi following his confrontation with Helen and Erin, Ben engages in an extended, incoherent monologue. Marty goes to Ruth's and asks why she worked for Ben's release. Ben arrives and admits he went to Helen's house. Ruth hides Ben at Darlene's. Erin confronts Charlotte and Jonah about Ben's claims and they admit Ben is right. Erin tells Helen she knows the truth about Helen's work and returns to Chicago. Recognizing they are vulnerable because Ben went to Helen's, Marty and Wendy plot to show Navarro they are more valuable to him than she is. Ben leaves Darlene's so he can pledge his love to Ruth. Nelson follows him into the casino, so Marty takes Ben out a side exit. Nelson follows Ruth home and Ruth challenges him about Cade's murder. Marty engineers a sudden increase in casino profits, meaning Maya will remain and continue auditing the Byrdes. Ben flees with Wendy, then calls police on himself, but Wendy talks officers out of arresting him. Ben calls Helen to apologize, and Wendy ends the call before Helen learns Ben's location. Wendy abandons Ben at a restaurant, then breaks down during a call to Marty. Ben sees Nelson arrive.\n |LineColor       = 01405F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 30\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = All In\n |DirectedBy      = Alik Sakharov\n |WrittenBy       = Chris Mundy\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = Nelson, Marty and Ruth cremate Ben's body at the funeral home.

Ruth and Wendy argue about blame for Ben's and Cade's deaths. Ruth quits working for Marty. Wendy admits she made the call revealing Ben's location. Marty consoles her by agreeing with her plan to make Navarro see their value. Wendy and Marty realize the way to win Navarro over is to end the cartel war. Marty provides still photos from Jonah's drone video of the attack on Cosgrove's truck to Maya, resulting in arrests of Lagunas members. Darlene avenges Ruth by shooting and wounding Frank Jr., then brings Frank Sr. into her business as a peace offering. Jonah confronts Helen at gunpoint about Ben's death, but Helen talks him out of shooting. Maya tells Marty Trevor gave Helen a copy of the confession Marty made to Maya. Navarro requires Wendy, Marty and Helen to attend his son's second baptism. Upon arrival, Nelson kills Helen and Navarro tells Marty and Wendy that this is the beginning of increased cooperation between the three of them.\n|LineColor  = 01405F }}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#00AAC0;\"|\n| 1\n| 70% (69 reviews)\n| 66 (29 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#066069;\"|\n| 2\n| 76% (45 reviews)\n| 59 (14 reviews)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#01405F;\"|\n| 3\n| 97% (29 reviews)\n| 77 (11 reviews)\n|}\n\n====Season 1====\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the first season had an approval rating of 70% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 6.84/10.
