The cathedral is situated in [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann Street]] in the [[Brisbane central business district]], and is the successor to an earlier [[pro-cathedral]], which occupied part of the contemporary [[Queens Gardens, Brisbane|Queens Gardens]] on [[William Street, Brisbane|William Street]], from 1854 to 1904. The cathedral is the second-oldest Anglican church in Brisbane, predated only by the extant [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane|All Saints]] church on [[Wickham Terrace]] (1862). It is also the only existing building with a stone vaulted ceiling in the southern hemisphere. The cathedral is listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]].<ref>{{Cite QHR||St John's Cathedral|600076|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is the centre for big diocesan events such as the ordinations of priests and deacons which attract large congregations; a parish church catering for a diverse congregation of worshipers from around the city of Brisbane; a major centre for the arts and music with its own orchestra, the Camerata of St John's, which holds several concerts in the cathedral each year; and an international centre of pilgrimage attracting over 20,000 visitors annually from around the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe choir of men and boys sing the traditional Anglican repertoire as well as more adventurous fare. The cathedral also possesses a four manual pipe organ, the largest cathedral organ in Australia, which hosts many recitalists from across the world: Pearson's design (and stone-vaulting) creates a five-second reverberation making organ-music particularly resonant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSt John's Cathedral is unique in Australia as the completion of the building design was achieved through collaboration between clergy, stonemasons and architects over a period of almost 100 years, as with Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals in the Middle Ages and, more recently, 20th century cathedrals such as [[Liverpool Cathedral]] in England, [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|St John the Divine]] in New York and [[Washington National Cathedral]] in Washington DC.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Service Times\n|-\n!

As a result, the building has been executed in three stages over two centuries between 1906 and 2009.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\nIn April 1889, Pearson's plans for the cathedral were approved for the original site bounded by George, Elizabeth and William Streets.<blockquote>It was a cruciform church with a wide nave, double aisles, apse and ambulatory, short transepts about halfway along the length of the building and an apsidal side chapel on the north. The west front had towers close to the end of the nave. The upper part of the west wall was supported by a relieving arch, which continued the line of the interior cross arches. The towers had massive buttresses. Their strong vertical lines carried on into corner turrets set before pyramidal spires.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/></blockquote>\n\nJohn Pearson died in November 1897, two weeks before Webber presented fresh plans to the cathedral chapter. In 1898, Frank Loughborough Pearson (John Pearson's son and partner) was entrusted to carry out his father's design.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/> In 1899, the cathedral chapter approved Pearson's revised plans only to be forced to reconsider the entire cathedral when the state government bought the original intended site. The present Ann Street site was purchased in late 1899 because it was \"\u2026central, commodious and had the natural advantage of being able to make the building erected on it a landmark for miles around.\"<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/> Frank Loughborough Pearson spent a year reworking his father's design and, on 22 May 1901, the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]) laid the [[foundation stone]] of the cathedral.<ref>Sayer et al., p.12</ref> In 1903, Bishop [[William Thomas Thornhill Webber|William Webber]] died and in 1904 Frank Pearson submitted his final plans to the cathedral chapter.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/>\n\n=== First stage ===\n[[File:Queensland State Archives 28 St Johns Cathedral Ann Street Brisbane June 1927.png|thumb|right|The apse and crossing in 1927]]\nThe first stage of construction began in 1906 and took four years to complete. This included the chancel, sanctuary and ambulatory, the quire and its aisles, the transepts and crossing, the Lady Chapel to the liturgical north of the quire, the double aisles and the first bay of the [[nave]].<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/> This stage was consecrated in October 1910, but consecration of the full building (like construction) has been achieved in stages.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\"/> After the [[Second World War]] money was raised in the hope of completing the cathedral as a war memorial. In 1947, Field-Marshal [[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] laid a [[foundation stone]] for a further two bays of the nave,<ref name=\"Cleary, p.5\">Cleary, p.5</ref> but construction ceased after the laying of the foundations.\n\n=== Second stage ===\nIn 1965 the second stage was commenced.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> Work on the second stage proceeded for a further four years and consisted of the laying of foundations for the extensions, a two-bay extension to the nave and demolition and removal of the temporary west wall.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\n=== Third stage ===\nThe third stage of construction commenced in 1989 and was completed in 2009 (with the exception of 29 life-sized statues on the west front and a set of cloisters on the north side of the cathedral which have yet to be commissioned). The third stage of construction comprised the erection of the south west porch, the final bay of the nave, the west front, the north and south towers and the central tower. This stage of work was overseen by Peter Dare, [[Master Mason]] of [[Exeter Cathedral]] in England. To ensure enough supply of sandstone for the project, the cathedral authorities purchased a [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] at [[Helidon, Queensland|Helidon]], {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Brisbane where each piece of stone was cut and finished and then trucked to the cathedral site in Ann Street. Some other stone, which had been quarried for the abandoned project to build the [[Holy Name Cathedral, Brisbane|Holy Name Cathedral]], was also purchased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe third stage of construction cost [[Australian dollar|A$]]40 million which was raised by public donations, bequests and grants from the federal, state and local governments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe copper-clad western spires were lifted into position on 1 March 2008 and subsequently blessed by Bishop [[John Parkes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, St John's Cathedral was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"structure and engineering feat\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Consecration===\nThe Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr Phillip Aspinall, officially reconsecrated the completed cathedral on 29 October 2009, attended by about 1500 people, 108 years after the laying of the foundation stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-11/100-year-construction-completed-on-brisbane/201154|title=100-year construction completed on Brisbane cathedral|last=Andree Withey|date=11 November 2008|website=ABC News|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029151128/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-11/100-year-construction-completed-on-brisbane/201154|archive-date=29 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, a series of statues, costing $45 000 each, were purchased and blessed by Archbishop Aspinall before being installed on the cathedral's facade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-28/statues-raised-at-st-johns-cathedral-in-brisbane/6052432|title=Hand-carved statues raised into place at St John's Cathedral in Brisbane|first=Matt|last=Watson|date=28 January 2015|website=ABC News|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208064033/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-28/statues-raised-at-st-johns-cathedral-in-brisbane/6052432|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nShortly before this, a storm warped one of the cathedral's walls, causing millions of dollars' worth of damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/st-johns-cathedrals-3-million-storm-damage-bill-20150218-13ie3d.html|title=St John's Cathedral's $3 million storm damage bill|first=Cameron|last=Atfield|date=18 February 2015|website=Brisbane Times|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031259/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/st-johns-cathedrals-3-million-storm-damage-bill-20150218-13ie3d.html|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anglicanchurchsq.org.au/repairs-st-johns-completed/|title=Repairs at St John's Cathedral complete - Anglican Church Southern Qld : Anglican Church Southern Queensland|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031851/https://anglicanchurchsq.org.au/repairs-st-johns-completed/|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Design elements==\n[[File:Nave at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, 2020, 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nave facing liturgical west]] \nThe cathedral was designed in the [[Gothic revival]] style by [[John Loughborough Pearson]], one of England's leading church architects of the late 19th century and bears similarities to [[Truro Cathedral]] in Cornwall, also designed by Pearson, although the architecture of St John's is more decidedly French Gothic in inspiration. The external walls are of randomly arranged brown, pink and mauve [[Brisbane tuff]] stone from the O\u2019Connelltown Quarry in the (now) suburb of [[Windsor, Queensland|Windsor]],<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\">Cleary, p.4</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=O'Connelltown| url=http://www.brisbanehistory.com/forgotten_districts.html#O%27CONNELLTOWN| website=Brisbane History| accessdate=3 June 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606230708/http://www.brisbanehistory.com/forgotten_districts.html#O%27CONNELLTOWN| archive-date=6 June 2014| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref> while the interior is primarily dressed sandstone (Helidon freestone) from Helidon near Toowoomba.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\">Hogan, p.37</ref> The granite and basalt used in the foundations and at the base of the columns came from Harcourt and Footscray in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] for the window dressings, doorways and arcading came from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\"/>\n\nThe initial architectural impact is achieved via its lofty ceilings, tall, delicately proportioned columns and low level lighting. The architects achieve a layering effect through the masking of external walls via colonnades (a colonnade denotes a long sequence of columns joined by their entablature which is the superstructure of mouldings and bands which lies horizontally above the columns) often free-standing.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\"/> The interior (by Frank Loughborough Pearson) reflects liturgical arrangements favoured by the Oxford movement from the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/> The design of the central nave toward the east end was reworked by Frank Pearson (1898\u20131904). He lengthened the nave and exchanged the lancet windows in the north transept for a [[rose window]], simplified the details of the east end and omitted much of the cathedral's internal decoration to meet financial constraints.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\">Cleary, p.3</ref> The north and south aisles, representing a bird's folded wings, are separated from the nave, or body, by Pearson's slender piers. The nave terminates at the crossing. The central tower rests on four large piers and is directly above. The north and south transepts (the transverse part of a [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]], crossing the nave at right angles) representing outstretched arms are to the left and right and the most sacred part of the cathedral is ahead.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n[[Image:High altar.jpg|thumb|left|High altar]]\nIn many respects, the architecture of St John's resembles the great [[Cistercian]] abbey churches of 12th and 13th century Europe. The Cistercian monks believed that church architecture should be simple and utilitarian and also preferably made of stone, relying for its effects upon simple elegance of design, noble proportions and the natural qualities of the materials. This can be seen in St John's in the atmosphere of the building created by the mass of stone pillars, ceilings and arches, the quality of the sandstone and the basic simplicity of the design and, apart from the west front, minimal ornamentation.\n\nAccording to Cleary, Pearson's elevated choir symbolically marks the passage from the secular nave into the higher and more holy choir. Here the clergy are also accommodated in their \"elaborately carved\" stalls and the archbishop's throne ''cathedra'' (symbolising his authority and pastoral responsibilities) \u2013 designed by Pearson resides. The Archipiscopal throne was carved in situ by Brisbane carver and cabinet maker,'''Hedley Smith''', in the 1930s. Two statuettes by Hedley Smith were added in 1948.  \n\nBeyond the choir is the presbytery and then the high altar and its surrounding sanctuary. The high altar is a free-standing structure with a great Byzantine-style stone [[baldacchino]] (a permanent ornamental canopy, as above a freestanding altar or throne), rather than a reredos, (a screen or a decorated part of the wall behind an altar in a church) supported on columns planned to risehigh above it. Beneath the high altar lie the remains of Bishop Webber.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\">Sayer et al., p.13</ref>\n\nHowever, as yet the baldacchino has not been constructed. In front of the altar in the sanctuary floor are two pieces of mosaic from the Holy Land, brought back after being uncovered during the First World War by the Australian Light Horse Regiment. One of these is part of the floor of a 6th-century synagogue at Jericho. The other is a fragment from the floor of a 6th-century Christian church at Gaza and is part of a larger mosaic now housed in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> Beyond the high altar the cathedral ends in a semicircular apse and ambulatory (processional aisle), a link to the architecture's French-Norman past.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\nMany features beyond the crossing including the altar, cross, candle sticks, pulpit, canopy, clergy stalls, pendant lights and litany desk were designed by Frank Pearson. He also designed the carved organ case and the rose window in the north transept.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n\nMany Brisbane architects were commissioned to design liturgical furniture for the cathedral's three chapels, the Lady Chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Spirit and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n\nThe initial design called for a galvanised iron roof; this was changed to terracotta roof tiles in 1907.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\"/> The resolution of unfinished design elements continues to pose challenges.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\nPews are being replaced by free-standing chairs. The baptismal font, previously in the north transept, has been moved to the west end of the nave.\n\n== Church Bells ==\n[[Image:St John's Cathedral bell tower, Brisbane, 2017 (05).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the bell tower]] \nThe cathedral has a [[peal of bells|peal]] of 12 bells hung for [[full circle ringing]] with the tenor weighing 16 [[hundredweight]].<ref name=Dove>{{cite web| title=Brisbane: Cath Ch of S John| url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?&DoveID=BRISBANE| publisher=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers| accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref> The first bells were made by [[John Warner & Sons]] in 1876 with funds raised by public subscription.<ref>{{cite web| title=Bell Ringers| url=http://www.stjohnscathedral.com.au/cathedral-life/bell-ringers.html| publisher=St John's Cathedral| accessdate=3 April 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127124613/http://www.stjohnscathedral.com.au/cathedral-life/bell-ringers.html| archivedate=27 January 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ringing takes place before the 9:30am Sunday service, to mark special occasions, and for weddings. The bells are rung by members of [[The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers]]. The bell tower is equipped with sound control and electronic simulator equipment which is utilised for Monday night ringing practice, and to aid in the teaching of new ringers.\nThe bells are named after Deans and Administrators of the cathedral since 1925 when the role was separated from that of Bishop of Brisbane. <ref name=\"northerntowers.org\"/> Bell names, weights, and pitch are listed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n ! rowspan=2| Number\n ! rowspan=2| Name\n ! colspan=3| Mass\n ! rowspan=2| Pitch\n |-\n ![[long ton|long measure]]\n !lb\n !kg\n  |-\n\n|-\n| 1 (Treble) || John || {{long ton||4|3|8|disp=table}} || B\n|-\n| 2 || David || {{long ton||5|0|26|disp=table}} || A\n|-\n| 3 || Francis || {{long ton||5|1|2|disp=table}} || G#\n|-\n| 4 || Horace || {{long ton||5|2|6|disp=table}} || F#\n|-\n| 5 || William || {{long ton||5|3|12|disp=table}} || E\n|-\n| 6 || Denis || {{long ton||6|2|0|disp=table}} || D#\n|-\n| 7 || William Pye || {{long ton||6|3|16|disp=table}} || C#\n|-\n| 8 || Cecil || {{long ton||7|2|13|disp=table}} || B\n|-\n| 9 || Ian || {{long ton||9|1|7|disp=table}} || A\n|-\n| 10 || Ralph || {{long ton||11|1|20|disp=table}} || G#\n|-\n| 11 || Robert || {{long ton||12|1|20|disp=table}} || F#\n|-\n| 12 (Tenor) || Arthur || {{long ton||16|1|17|disp=table}} || E\n|}\n\n==Other buildings==\nBuildings associated with St John's include [[Webber House, Brisbane|Webber House]], [[Church House, Brisbane|Church House]], [[The Deanery, Brisbane|The Deanery]] (formerly Adelaide House) and [[St Martin's House]]. These buildings provide the traditional experience of only getting the full view of the cathedral when quite close (after having wound one's way through narrow medieval city streets) thus adding to the impact and feeling of grandeur.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.39\">Hogan, p.39</ref>\n\n=== Webber House ===\n[[File:Webber House, Ann Street, Brisbane, Queensland 2020.jpg|thumb|[[Webber House, Brisbane|Webber House]], 2020\n]]\nWebber House was built in 1904. It was designed by [[Robert Smith Dods|Robin Dods]] (1868\u20131920).  The stone used in the Webber house came from the old St John's Pro-Cathedral in William Street. Webber House was formerly known as School House and housed St John's Primary School until 1941.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> The school went on to become [[Anglican Church Grammar School]].\n\n=== Church House ===\n[[File:Church House, Brisbane, Queensland 2020, 01.jpg|thumb|[[Church House, Brisbane|Church House]], 2020]]\nChurch House was built in 1909. Also designed by [[Robert Smith Dods|Robin Dods]] and was designed to conform to Pearson's concept of St John's Cathedral and its traditional cathedral setting. (The heart design found in many of Dods\u2019 buildings can be seen on the iron gates.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/>) Both are Gothic in overall form and design, having details mainly in the style of ''Art Nouveau''. They have been placed to conceal a view of the cathedral from a northerly approach.<ref>Hogan, p.38</ref>\n\n=== Adelaide House ===\nThe oldest building in the precinct is [[The Deanery, Brisbane|The Deanery]], also known as called Adelaide House, built in 1853. From the verandah of this building the first [[Governor of Queensland]], Sir [[George Bowen]], read the proclamation declaring [[Separation of Queensland|Queensland a separate colony]] on 10 December 1859. The building then became Queensland's first [[Government House|government house]].<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/>\n\n=== St Martin's House ===\nThe other more eclectic building with Gothic touches found in the precinct is [[St Martin's House]], formerly St Martin's Hospital. It was built as a war memorial after the [[First World War]] and is dedicated to [[St Martin of Tours]] as 11 November ([[Remembrance Day]]) is his feast day.<ref>Sayer et al., p.14</ref> Designed by Lang Powell the design was strongly influenced by the Cathedral and adjacent buildings. This is evident through the choice of building materials, roof forms and architectural motifs. St Martin's is sited to protect St John's from noise and visual intrusion from the city and forms a quiet courtyard beside the cathedral.

The cathedral is situated in [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann Street]] in the [[Brisbane central business district]], and is the successor to an earlier [[pro-cathedral]], which occupied part of the contemporary [[Queens Gardens, Brisbane|Queens Gardens]] on [[William Street, Brisbane|William Street]], from 1854 to 1904. The cathedral is the second-oldest Anglican church in Brisbane, predated only by the extant [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane|All Saints]] church on [[Wickham Terrace]] (1862). It is also the only existing building with a stone vaulted ceiling in the southern hemisphere. The cathedral is listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]].<ref>{{Cite QHR||St John's Cathedral|600076|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe cathedral is the centre for big diocesan events such as the ordinations of priests and deacons which attract large congregations; a parish church catering for a diverse congregation of worshipers from around the city of Brisbane; a major centre for the arts and music with its own orchestra, the Camerata of St John's, which holds several concerts in the cathedral each year; and an international centre of pilgrimage attracting over 20,000 visitors annually from around the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe choir of men and boys sing the traditional Anglican repertoire as well as more adventurous fare. The cathedral also possesses a four manual pipe organ, the largest cathedral organ in Australia, which hosts many recitalists from across the world: Pearson's design (and stone-vaulting) creates a five-second reverberation making organ-music particularly resonant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSt John's Cathedral is unique in Australia as the completion of the building design was achieved through collaboration between clergy, stonemasons and architects over a period of almost 100 years, as with Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals in the Middle Ages and, more recently, 20th century cathedrals such as [[Liverpool Cathedral]] in England, [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|St John the Divine]] in New York and [[Washington National Cathedral]] in Washington DC.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Service Times\n|-\n!

As a result, the building has been executed in three stages over two centuries between 1906 and 2009.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\nIn April 1889, Pearson's plans for the cathedral were approved for the original site bounded by George, Elizabeth and William Streets.<blockquote>It was a cruciform church with a wide nave, double aisles, apse and ambulatory, short transepts about halfway along the length of the building and an apsidal side chapel on the north. The west front had towers close to the end of the nave. The upper part of the west wall was supported by a relieving arch, which continued the line of the interior cross arches. The towers had massive buttresses. Their strong vertical lines carried on into corner turrets set before pyramidal spires.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/></blockquote>\n\nJohn Pearson died in November 1897, two weeks before Webber presented fresh plans to the cathedral chapter. In 1898, Frank Loughborough Pearson (John Pearson's son and partner) was entrusted to carry out his father's design.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/> In 1899, the cathedral chapter approved Pearson's revised plans only to be forced to reconsider the entire cathedral when the state government bought the original intended site. The present Ann Street site was purchased in late 1899 because it was \"\u2026central, commodious and had the natural advantage of being able to make the building erected on it a landmark for miles around.\"<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/> Frank Loughborough Pearson spent a year reworking his father's design and, on 22 May 1901, the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]) laid the [[foundation stone]] of the cathedral.<ref>Sayer et al., p.12</ref> In 1903, Bishop [[William Thomas Thornhill Webber|William Webber]] died and in 1904 Frank Pearson submitted his final plans to the cathedral chapter.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.2\"/>\n\n=== First stage ===\n[[File:Queensland State Archives 28 St Johns Cathedral Ann Street Brisbane June 1927.png|thumb|right|The apse and crossing in 1927]]\nThe first stage of construction began in 1906 and took four years to complete. This included the chancel, sanctuary and ambulatory, the quire and its aisles, the transepts and crossing, the Lady Chapel to the liturgical north of the quire, the double aisles and the first bay of the [[nave]].<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/> This stage was consecrated in October 1910, but consecration of the full building (like construction) has been achieved in stages.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\"/> After the [[Second World War]] money was raised in the hope of completing the cathedral as a war memorial. In 1947, Field-Marshal [[Viscount Montgomery of Alamein]] laid a [[foundation stone]] for a further two bays of the nave,<ref name=\"Cleary, p.5\">Cleary, p.5</ref> but construction ceased after the laying of the foundations.\n\n=== Second stage ===\nIn 1965 the second stage was commenced.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> Work on the second stage proceeded for a further four years and consisted of the laying of foundations for the extensions, a two-bay extension to the nave and demolition and removal of the temporary west wall.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\n=== Third stage ===\nThe third stage of construction commenced in 1989 and was completed in 2009 (with the exception of 29 life-sized statues on the west front and a set of cloisters on the north side of the cathedral which have yet to be commissioned). The third stage of construction comprised the erection of the south west porch, the final bay of the nave, the west front, the north and south towers and the central tower. This stage of work was overseen by Peter Dare, [[Master Mason]] of [[Exeter Cathedral]] in England. To ensure enough supply of sandstone for the project, the cathedral authorities purchased a [[sandstone]] [[quarry]] at [[Helidon, Queensland|Helidon]], {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Brisbane where each piece of stone was cut and finished and then trucked to the cathedral site in Ann Street. Some other stone, which had been quarried for the abandoned project to build the [[Holy Name Cathedral, Brisbane|Holy Name Cathedral]], was also purchased.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe third stage of construction cost [[Australian dollar|A$]]40 million which was raised by public donations, bequests and grants from the federal, state and local governments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe copper-clad western spires were lifted into position on 1 March 2008 and subsequently blessed by Bishop [[John Parkes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, St John's Cathedral was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as a \"structure and engineering feat\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Consecration===\nThe Archbishop of Brisbane, Dr Phillip Aspinall, officially reconsecrated the completed cathedral on 29 October 2009, attended by about 1500 people, 108 years after the laying of the foundation stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-11/100-year-construction-completed-on-brisbane/201154|title=100-year construction completed on Brisbane cathedral|last=Andree Withey|date=11 November 2008|website=ABC News|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029151128/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-11-11/100-year-construction-completed-on-brisbane/201154|archive-date=29 October 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, a series of statues, costing $45 000 each, were purchased and blessed by Archbishop Aspinall before being installed on the cathedral's facade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-28/statues-raised-at-st-johns-cathedral-in-brisbane/6052432|title=Hand-carved statues raised into place at St John's Cathedral in Brisbane|first=Matt|last=Watson|date=28 January 2015|website=ABC News|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208064033/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-28/statues-raised-at-st-johns-cathedral-in-brisbane/6052432|archive-date=8 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nShortly before this, a storm warped one of the cathedral's walls, causing millions of dollars' worth of damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/st-johns-cathedrals-3-million-storm-damage-bill-20150218-13ie3d.html|title=St John's Cathedral's $3 million storm damage bill|first=Cameron|last=Atfield|date=18 February 2015|website=Brisbane Times|accessdate=31 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031259/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/st-johns-cathedrals-3-million-storm-damage-bill-20150218-13ie3d.html|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anglicanchurchsq.org.au/repairs-st-johns-completed/|title=Repairs at St John's Cathedral complete - Anglican Church Southern Qld : Anglican Church Southern Queensland|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731031851/https://anglicanchurchsq.org.au/repairs-st-johns-completed/|archive-date=31 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Design elements==\n[[File:Nave at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, 2020, 01.jpg|thumb|right|Nave facing liturgical west]] \nThe cathedral was designed in the [[Gothic revival]] style by [[John Loughborough Pearson]], one of England's leading church architects of the late 19th century and bears similarities to [[Truro Cathedral]] in Cornwall, also designed by Pearson, although the architecture of St John's is more decidedly French Gothic in inspiration. The external walls are of randomly arranged brown, pink and mauve [[Brisbane tuff]] stone from the O\u2019Connelltown Quarry in the (now) suburb of [[Windsor, Queensland|Windsor]],<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\">Cleary, p.4</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=O'Connelltown| url=http://www.brisbanehistory.com/forgotten_districts.html#O%27CONNELLTOWN| website=Brisbane History| accessdate=3 June 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606230708/http://www.brisbanehistory.com/forgotten_districts.html#O%27CONNELLTOWN| archive-date=6 June 2014| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref> while the interior is primarily dressed sandstone (Helidon freestone) from Helidon near Toowoomba.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\">Hogan, p.37</ref> The granite and basalt used in the foundations and at the base of the columns came from Harcourt and Footscray in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] for the window dressings, doorways and arcading came from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\"/>\n\nThe initial architectural impact is achieved via its lofty ceilings, tall, delicately proportioned columns and low level lighting. The architects achieve a layering effect through the masking of external walls via colonnades (a colonnade denotes a long sequence of columns joined by their entablature which is the superstructure of mouldings and bands which lies horizontally above the columns) often free-standing.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.37\"/> The interior (by Frank Loughborough Pearson) reflects liturgical arrangements favoured by the Oxford movement from the 1840s.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/> The design of the central nave toward the east end was reworked by Frank Pearson (1898\u20131904). He lengthened the nave and exchanged the lancet windows in the north transept for a [[rose window]], simplified the details of the east end and omitted much of the cathedral's internal decoration to meet financial constraints.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\">Cleary, p.3</ref> The north and south aisles, representing a bird's folded wings, are separated from the nave, or body, by Pearson's slender piers. The nave terminates at the crossing. The central tower rests on four large piers and is directly above. The north and south transepts (the transverse part of a [[Cruciform#Cruciform architectural plan|cruciform church]], crossing the nave at right angles) representing outstretched arms are to the left and right and the most sacred part of the cathedral is ahead.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n[[Image:High altar.jpg|thumb|left|High altar]]\nIn many respects, the architecture of St John's resembles the great [[Cistercian]] abbey churches of 12th and 13th century Europe. The Cistercian monks believed that church architecture should be simple and utilitarian and also preferably made of stone, relying for its effects upon simple elegance of design, noble proportions and the natural qualities of the materials. This can be seen in St John's in the atmosphere of the building created by the mass of stone pillars, ceilings and arches, the quality of the sandstone and the basic simplicity of the design and, apart from the west front, minimal ornamentation.\n\nAccording to Cleary, Pearson's elevated choir symbolically marks the passage from the secular nave into the higher and more holy choir. Here the clergy are also accommodated in their \"elaborately carved\" stalls and the archbishop's throne ''cathedra'' (symbolising his authority and pastoral responsibilities) \u2013 designed by Pearson resides. The Archipiscopal throne was carved in situ by Brisbane carver and cabinet maker,'''Hedley Smith''', in the 1930s. Two statuettes by Hedley Smith were added in 1948.  \n\nBeyond the choir is the presbytery and then the high altar and its surrounding sanctuary. The high altar is a free-standing structure with a great Byzantine-style stone [[baldacchino]] (a permanent ornamental canopy, as above a freestanding altar or throne), rather than a reredos, (a screen or a decorated part of the wall behind an altar in a church) supported on columns planned to risehigh above it. Beneath the high altar lie the remains of Bishop Webber.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\">Sayer et al., p.13</ref>\n\nHowever, as yet the baldacchino has not been constructed. In front of the altar in the sanctuary floor are two pieces of mosaic from the Holy Land, brought back after being uncovered during the First World War by the Australian Light Horse Regiment. One of these is part of the floor of a 6th-century synagogue at Jericho. The other is a fragment from the floor of a 6th-century Christian church at Gaza and is part of a larger mosaic now housed in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> Beyond the high altar the cathedral ends in a semicircular apse and ambulatory (processional aisle), a link to the architecture's French-Norman past.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\nMany features beyond the crossing including the altar, cross, candle sticks, pulpit, canopy, clergy stalls, pendant lights and litany desk were designed by Frank Pearson. He also designed the carved organ case and the rose window in the north transept.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n\nMany Brisbane architects were commissioned to design liturgical furniture for the cathedral's three chapels, the Lady Chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Spirit and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.3\"/>\n\nThe initial design called for a galvanised iron roof; this was changed to terracotta roof tiles in 1907.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.4\"/> The resolution of unfinished design elements continues to pose challenges.<ref name=\"Cleary, p.1\"/>\n\nPews are being replaced by free-standing chairs. The baptismal font, previously in the north transept, has been moved to the west end of the nave.\n\n== Church Bells ==\n[[Image:St John's Cathedral bell tower, Brisbane, 2017 (05).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the bell tower]] \nThe cathedral has a [[peal of bells|peal]] of 12 bells hung for [[full circle ringing]] with the tenor weighing 16 [[hundredweight]].<ref name=Dove>{{cite web| title=Brisbane: Cath Ch of S John| url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?&DoveID=BRISBANE| publisher=Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers| accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref> The first bells were made by [[John Warner & Sons]] in 1876 with funds raised by public subscription.<ref>{{cite web| title=Bell Ringers| url=http://www.stjohnscathedral.com.au/cathedral-life/bell-ringers.html| publisher=St John's Cathedral| accessdate=3 April 2014| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127124613/http://www.stjohnscathedral.com.au/cathedral-life/bell-ringers.html| archivedate=27 January 2014| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ringing takes place before the 9:30am Sunday service, to mark special occasions, and for weddings. The bells are rung by members of [[The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers]].

It was designed by [[Robert Smith Dods|Robin Dods]] (1868\u20131920).  The stone used in the Webber house came from the old St John's Pro-Cathedral in William Street. Webber House was formerly known as School House and housed St John's Primary School until 1941.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/> The school went on to become [[Anglican Church Grammar School]].\n\n=== Church House ===\n[[File:Church House, Brisbane, Queensland 2020, 01.jpg|thumb|[[Church House, Brisbane|Church House]], 2020]]\nChurch House was built in 1909.

(The heart design found in many of Dods\u2019 buildings can be seen on the iron gates.<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/>) Both are Gothic in overall form and design, having details mainly in the style of ''Art Nouveau''. They have been placed to conceal a view of the cathedral from a northerly approach.<ref>Hogan, p.38</ref>\n\n=== Adelaide House ===\nThe oldest building in the precinct is [[The Deanery, Brisbane|The Deanery]], also known as called Adelaide House, built in 1853. From the verandah of this building the first [[Governor of Queensland]], Sir [[George Bowen]], read the proclamation declaring [[Separation of Queensland|Queensland a separate colony]] on 10 December 1859. The building then became Queensland's first [[Government House|government house]].<ref name=\"Sayer et al., p.13\"/>\n\n=== St Martin's House ===\nThe other more eclectic building with Gothic touches found in the precinct is [[St Martin's House]], formerly St Martin's Hospital. It was built as a war memorial after the [[First World War]] and is dedicated to [[St Martin of Tours]] as 11 November ([[Remembrance Day]]) is his feast day.<ref>Sayer et al., p.14</ref> Designed by Lang Powell the design was strongly influenced by the Cathedral and adjacent buildings. This is evident through the choice of building materials, roof forms and architectural motifs. St Martin's is sited to protect St John's from noise and visual intrusion from the city and forms a quiet courtyard beside the cathedral. St Martin's shows similarities to the \"Red Brick House\" designed by Philip Webb for William Morris.<ref name=\"Hogan, p.39\"/>\n\n==Deans of Brisbane==\nThe role of dean was separated from that of bishop in 1925.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* 2008\u2013present: Peter Charles Catt (previously [[Anglican Diocese of Grafton|Dean of Grafton]])\n* 2004\u20132008: [[John Parkes|Anthony John Parkes]] (afterwards [[Bishop of Wangaratta]], 2008)\n* 1999-2003: David Thomas \n* 1985\u20131998: [[Arthur John Grimshaw]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.anglicanarchives.org.au/hdms-html/HAMIS063.htm| title=Parish records created by the provenance of Hamilton| accessdate=2012-12-26| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410023520/http://anglicanarchives.org.au/HDMS-HTML/HAMIS063.htm| archivedate=10 April 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* 1973\u20131981: [[Ian George|Ian Gordon Combe George]] (afterwards Archdeacon of Canberra, 1981)\n* 1967\u20131972: [[Cecil Muschamp|Cecil Emerson Barron Muschamp]] (previously [[Bishop of Kalgoorlie]], 1950\u20131967)\n* 1958\u20131967: [[Bill Baddeley|William Pye Baddeley]]\n* 1932\u20131952: [[William Barrett (priest)|William Edward Colvile Barrett]]\n* 1925\u20131930: [[De Witt Batty|Francis de Witt Batty]] (afterwards [[Bishop of Newcastle (Australia)|Bishop of Newcastle]], 1930)\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of new ecclesiastical buildings by J.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R. Medical University]] (1989), [[Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University|Veterinary and Animal Sciences University]] (1989), [[Periyar University]] (1997) and [[Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University|Dr. Ambedkar Law University]] (1996).\n\nIn 1912 endowments were made to the university to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology and Indian Economics. In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background.

The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people to the risk of fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise.

Calcitonin decreases osteoclast activity, and decreases the formation of new osteoclasts, resulting in decreased resorption.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  Calcitonin has a greater effect in young children than in adults, and plays a smaller role in bone remodeling than PTH.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn some cases where bone resorption outpaces ossification, the bone is broken down much faster than it can be renewed. The bone becomes more porous and fragile, exposing people to the risk of fractures. Depending on where in the body bone resorption occurs, additional problems like tooth loss can arise. This can be caused by conditions such as [[hyperparathyroidism]] and [[hypovitaminosis D]] or even decreased hormonal production in the elderly.  Some diseases with symptoms of decreased bone density are [[osteoporosis]], and [[rickets]].\n\nSome people who experience increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation are [[astronauts]]. Due to the condition of being in a [[zero-gravity]] environment, astronauts do not need to work their musculoskeletal system as hard as when on [[earth]]. Ossification decreases due to a lack of stress, while resorption  increases, leading to a net decrease in bone density.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Iwamoto J, Takeda T, Sato Y | date = Jun 2005 | title = Interventions to prevent bone loss in astronauts during space flight | url = | journal = The Keio Journal of Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 55\u20139 | pmid = 16077253 | doi=10.2302/kjm.54.55}}</ref>\n\n== Alcoholism ==\nThe effects of alcohol on [[bone mineral density]] (BMD) are well-known and well-studied in animal and human populations. Through direct and indirect pathways, prolonged ethanol exposure increases fracture risk by decreasing bone mineral density and promoting osteoporosis.

Styles include English and Western, which each have different skills and disciplines within them. English includes jumping, dressage, equitation, and hunter while Western includes barrel racing, pole bending, roping, and reining <ref>\u201cEnglish Vs Western: What Is Right For You?\u201d COWGIRL Magazine, 15 May 2019, https://cowgirlmagazine.com/english-vs-western/.</ref>. Each discipline also requires different equipment and attire. Along with that, there are some breeds that are better for each discipline.\n\nFor English hunter and jumper riding, it's best to have a Belgian Warmblood, Dutch Warmblood, Hanoverian, Holsteiner, or an Oldenburger <ref> \u201cBest Show Jumping Horse Breeds.\u201d HIPICO Santa Fe, 27 July 2017, https://www.hipicosantafe.com/best-show-jumping-horse-breeds/. </ref>. These two styles of riding are very similar for the demands of the horse, the biggest difference between the two styles is the rules involved, therefore the same breeds can be suitable for either <ref> \u201cHunter Jumper Horses - Horse Breeds & Info.\u201d Hunter Jumper Horses -Horse Breeds, https://www.artbycrane.com/horse_breeds/light_horse_breeds/hunter_jumper_horses.html. </ref>. For English dressage, it's best to have an Andalusian, Hanoverian, Oldenburg, Danish Warmblood, or a Lusitano <ref> Top Five Dressage Breeds, http://horsebreedsinfo.com/Top-Five-Dressage-Breeds.html. </ref>. For English equitation, a Morgan horse is best <ref> https://www.equestrian-escapes.com/10-Of-The-World\u2019s-Best-Horse-Breeds/ </ref>, however, many other breeds can be suitable. The most important qualities in an equitation horse are a happiness to do the job, a steady mindset, and good movement <ref> Malenfant, Dallys. \u201cEquitation Horses: How to Choose the Right One.\u201d Saddle & Bridle, 26 Oct. 2016, https://www.saddleandbridle.com/articles/learn/311-picking-the-perfect-equitation-horse. </ref>. Many horses can fit these qualities, thus there is not just one specific set of breeds that are best for equitation.\n\nFor Western barrel racing, pole bending, and reining, it's best to have a Thoroughbred, Paint Horse, Quarter Horse, Appaloosa, or a Grade Horse. These horses are smaller, fast, and agile, making them the best horse for the job <ref> LaShauna. \u201cTop 5 Horse Breeds for Barrel Racing.\u201d PetHelpful, PetHelpful, 7 Aug. 2019, https://pethelpful.com/horses/Top-5-horse-breeds-for-barrel-racing. </ref>. These events are usually found in rodeos, where the same breed of horse can complete different tasks. For Western pole bending, it's best to have a horse that can also complete cattle work. These are warmbloods, Quarter horses, appaloosas, palominos, fox trotters and paints <ref> \u201cWhat\u0092s Involved in Reining Equestrian Events: Cutting, Sliding, Spins and More.\u201d Reining Equestrian Event Basics: Freestyle, Cutting and Spins, http://www.horses-and-horse-information.com/articles/horsereining.shtml. </ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Driving (horse)]]\n*[[Domestication of the horse]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Working animals}}\n\n[[Category:Equestrianism]]\n", "name_user": "\u00dejarkur", "label": "safe", "comment": "WP:REFPUNC, links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_horse"}

The interview is usually preceded by the evaluation of submitted [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s from interested candidates, possibly by examining job applications or reading many resumes. Next, after this screening, a small number of  candidates for interviews is selected.\n\nPotential job interview opportunities also include networking events and career fairs. The job interview is considered one of the most useful tools for evaluating potential employees.<ref name=Chron>{{cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/value-importance-job-interview-1660.html |title=The Value or Importance of a Job Interview |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]] |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> It also demands significant resources from the employer, yet has been demonstrated to be notoriously unreliable in identifying the optimal person for the job.<ref name=Chron/> An interview also allows the candidate to assess the [[corporate culture]] and demands of the job.\n\nMultiple rounds of job interviews and/or other candidate selection methods may be used where there are many candidates or the job is particularly challenging or desirable. Earlier rounds sometimes called 'screening interviews' may involve fewer staff from the employers and will typically be much shorter and less in-depth. An increasingly common initial interview approach is the telephone interview. This is especially common when the candidates do not live near the employer and has the advantage of keeping costs low for both sides. Since 2003, interviews have been held through video conferencing software, such as [[Skype]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/hiatt/howto/interview/index.html |title=INTRODUCTION TO INTERVIEWING |publisher=[[Brandeis University]] |accessdate=2015-05-02}}</ref> Once all candidates have been interviewed, the employer typically selects the most desirable candidate(s) and begins the negotiation of a job offer.\n\n==Constructs==\nResearchers have attempted to identify which interview strategies or \"constructs\" can help interviewers choose the best candidate.

The job-relevant applicant attributes that the questions purportedly assess are thought to be necessary for one to successfully perform on the job. The job-relevant constructs that have been assessed in the interview can be classified into three categories: general traits, experiential factors, and core job elements. The first category refers to relatively stable applicant traits. The second category refers to job knowledge that the applicant has acquired over time. The third category refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities associated with the job.\n \n'''General traits:'''\n* Mental ability: Applicants' capacity to listen, to communicate, to work with a team, to have attention to detail,<ref>[https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/151793/1/2019_12_Pinciroli.pdf ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF BUSINESS AGILITY MODEL ON SMART ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS | Marco Pinciroli | interpersonal skills; critical thinking; independent evaluation; tolerance and empathy]</ref>, and to learn and process information,<ref name=\"Huffcutt, A.

San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref>\n\n'''Interviewee performance'''\nInterviewer evaluations of applicant responses also tend to be colored by how an applicant behaves in the interview. These behaviors may not be directly related to the constructs the interview questions were designed to assess, but can be related to aspects of the job for which they are applying. Applicants without realizing it may engage in a number of behaviors that influence ratings of their performance. The applicant may have acquired these behaviors during training or from previous interview experience. These interviewee performance constructs can also be classified into three categories: social effectiveness skills, interpersonal presentation, and personal/contextual factors.\n \n'''Social effectiveness skills:'''\n* Impression management: Applicants' attempt to make sure the interviewer forms a positive impression of them<ref>Schlenker, B.

These factors are typically not relevant to whether the individual can do the job (that is, not related to [[job performance]]), thus, their influence on interview ratings should be minimized or excluded. In fact, there are laws in many countries that prohibit consideration of many of these protected classes of people when making selection decisions. Using structured interviews with multiple interviewers coupled with training may help reduce the effect of the following characteristics on interview ratings.<ref name=\"McCarthy, J.

For example, some research suggests that applicant's cognitive ability, education, training, and work experiences may be better captured in unstructured interviews, whereas applicant's job knowledge, organizational fit, interpersonal skills, and applied knowledge may be better captured in a structured interview.<ref name=\"Huffcutt, A.

Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by constructs beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific constructs measured during the interview.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = P.

Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some constructs in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same constructs.

When interview fit questions were examined, only 4% of the questions used in interviews were similar across the majority of organizations. 22% of questions were commonly used by recruiters in some organizations. In contrast, 74% of the questions had no commonality between organizations.<ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/> Although the idea of fit is similar in many organizations, the questions used and how that information is judged may be very different.<ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/>\n\nPerson-job fit and Person-organization fit have different levels of importance at different stages of a multi-stage interview proves. Despite this, Person-job fit is considered of highest importance throughout the entire process. Organizations focus more on job-related skills early on to screen out potential unqualified candidates. Thus, more questions are devoted to Person-job fit during the initial interview stages.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/> Once applicants have passed the initial stages, more questions are used for Person-organization fit in the final interview stages.

Again, Person-job fit questions are used to screen out and reduce the number of applicants.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/>\n\nPotential applicants also use job interviews to assess their fit within an organization. This can determine if an applicant will take a job offer when one is offered.

That is, impressions interviewers form early on may affect how they view the person in a later phase.\n\n'''Preinterview phase''':\nThe preinterview phase encompasses the information available to the interviewer beforehand (e.g., resumes, test scores, social networking site information) and the perceptions interviewers form about applicants from this information prior to the actual face-to-face interaction between the two individuals. In this phase, interviewers are likely to already have ideas about the characteristics that would make a person ideal or qualified for the position.<ref name=\"DMS\">Dipboye, R.

In this way, interviewers typically have an impression even before the actual face-to-face interview interaction. Nowadays with [[recent technological advancements]], interviewers have an even larger amount of information available on some candidates. For example, interviewers can obtain information from search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo), blogs, and even social networks (e.g. Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter). While some of this information may be job-related, some of it may not be. In some cases, a review of Facebook may reveal undesirable behaviors such as drunkenness or drug use. Despite the relevance of the information, any information interviewers obtain about the applicant before the interview is likely to influence theirimpression of the candidate. <ref name=\"MD88\"/><ref name=\"MD88Effect\">{{cite journal | last1 = Macan | first1 = T. | last2 = Dipboye | first2 = R.

Such anxiety may hamper how well they actually perform and present themselves during the interview, fulfilling the original thoughts of the interviewer. Alternatively, interviewees who perceive an interviewer believes they are qualified for the job may feel more at ease and comfortable during the exchange, and consequently actually perform better in the interview. Because of the dynamic nature of the interview, the interaction between the behaviors and thoughts of both parties is a continuous process whereby information is processed and informs subsequent behavior, thoughts, and evaluations.\n\n'''Postinterview phase''':\nAfter the interview is conducted, the interviewer must form an evaluation of the interviewee's qualifications for the position. The interviewer most likely takes into consideration all the information, even from the preinterview phase, and integrates it to form a postinterview evaluation of the applicant. In the final stage of the interview process, the interviewer uses his/her evaluation of the candidate (i.e., in the form of interview ratings or judgment) to make a final decision. Sometimes other selection tools (e.g., work samples, cognitive ability tests, personality tests) are used in combination with the interview to make final hiring decisions; however, interviews remain the most commonly used selection device in North America.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = A. | last2 = McFarland | first2 = L. | last3 = Baron | first3 = H. | last4 = Page | first4 = R. | year = 1999 | title = An international look at selection practices: Nation and culture as explanations for variability in practice | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 359\u2013391 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1999.tb00165.x}}</ref>\n\n'''For interviewees''':\nAlthough the description of the interview process above focuses on the perspective of the interviewer, job applicants also gather information on the job and/or organization and form impressions prior to the interview.<ref name=\"DMS\"/> The interview is a two-way exchange and applicants are also making decisions about whether the company is a good fit for them. Essentially, the process model illustrates that the interview is not an isolated interaction, but rather a complex process that begins with two parties forming judgments and gathering information, and ends with a final interviewer decision.\n\n==Types==\nThere are many types of interviews that organizations can conduct. What is the same across all interview types, however, is the idea of interview structure. How much an interview is structured, or developed and conducted the same way across all applicants, depends on the number of certain elements included in that interview. Overall, the interview can be standardized both with regard to the content (i.e., what questions are asked) and to the evaluative process (i.e., how the applicants\u2019 responses to the questions are scored). When an interview is standardized, it increases the likelihood that an interviewee's ratings are due to the quality of his/her responses instead of non-job-related and often distracting factors, such as appearance. Interview structure is more appropriately thought to be on a continuum, ranging from completely unstructured to fully structured.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese|year=2009|title=The employment interview: A review of current studies and directions for future research|url=|journal=Human Resource Management Review|volume=19|issue=3|pages=203\u2013218|doi=10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.03.006}}</ref> However, structure is often treated as a having only two categories (that is, structured vs. unstructured), which many researchers believe to be too simple of an approach.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Chapman\" />\n\n'''<big>Unstructured</big>'''\n\nThe unstructured interview, or one that does not include a good number of standardization elements, is the most common form of interview today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsai, W., Chen, F., Chen, H., Tseng K.|year=2016|title=When will interviewers be willing to use high-structured job interviews?

Unstructured interviews essentially allow the interviewer to conduct the interview however he or she thinks is best.\n\nGiven unstructured interviews can change based on who the interviewer might be, it is not surprising that unstructured interviews are typically preferred by interviewers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Structured selection interviews: Why do they work?

An interview's degree of structure is often thought of as the extent to which these elements are included when conducting interviews.\n\nContent structure:\n \n* Ensure questions are relevant to the job, as indicated by a [[job analysis]]\n* Ask the same questions of all interviewees\n* Limit prompting, or follow up questions, that interviewers may ask\n* Ask better questions, such as behavioral description questions\n* Have a longer interview\n* Control ancillary information available to the interviewees, such as resumes\n* Do not allow questions from applicants during interview\n \nEvaluation structure:\n \n* Rate each answer rather than making an overall evaluation at the end of the interview\n* Use anchored rating scales (for an example, see [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales|BARS]])\n* Have the interviewer take detailed notes\n* Have more than one interviewer view each applicant (i.e. have panel interviews)\n* Have the same interviewers rate each applicant\n* Do not allow any discussion about the applicants between interviewers\n* Train the interviewers\n* Use statistical procedures to create an overall interview score\n\nMultiple research studies have shown that using these elements to design the interview increases the interview's ability to identify high-performing individuals.

P. 1980\" /> ask job applicants to imagine a set of circumstances and then indicate how they would respond in that situation; hence, the questions are future oriented. One advantage of situational questions is that all interviewees respond to the same hypothetical situation rather than describe experiences unique to them from their past.  Another advantage is that situational questions allow respondents who have had no direct job experience relevant to a particular question to provide a hypothetical response.<ref name=\"Pulakos, E. D. 1995\"/> Two core aspects of the SI are the development of situational dilemmas that employees encounter on the job, and a scoring guide to evaluate responses to each dilemma.<ref name=\"Latham, G.

The most common types of questions either ask the applicant to solve puzzles or [[brain teaser]]s (e.g., \"Why are manhole covers round?\") or to solve unusual problems (e.g., \"How would you weigh an airplane without a scale?\").<ref>{{cite web |author=Honer, J., Wright, C.

The case problem is often a business situation or a business case that the interviewer has worked on in real life.\nIn recent years, company in other sectors like Design, Architecture, Marketing, Advertising, Finance and Strategy have adopted a similar approach to interviewing candidates. Technology has transformed the Case-based and Technical interview process from a purely private in-person experience to an online exchange of job skills and endorsements.\n\n====Panel====\nAnother type of job interview found throughout the professional and academic ranks is the ''panel interview''.  In this type of interview the candidate is interviewed by a group of panelists representing the various stakeholders in the hiring process.  Within this format there are several approaches to conducting the interview.  Example formats include; \n* Presentation format \u2013 The candidate is given a generic topic and asked to make a presentation to the panel.  Often used in academic or sales-related interviews.\n* Role format \u2013 Each panelist is tasked with asking questions related to a specific role of the position.  For example, one panelist may ask technical questions, another may ask management questions, another may ask customer service related questions etc.\n* Skeet shoot format \u2013 The candidate is given questions from a series of panelists in rapid succession to test his or her ability to handle stress filled situations.\n\nThe benefits of the panel approach to interviewing include: time savings over serial interviewing, more focused interviews as there is often less time spend building rapport with small talk, and \"[[Apples and oranges|apples to apples]]\" comparison because each stake holder/interviewer/panelist gets to hear the answers to the same questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com/Panel-Interview.html |title=Panel Interview - The good, the bad and what do look out for! |publisher=Staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>\n\n====Group====\nIn the group interview, multiple applicants are interviewed at one time by one or more interviewers. This type of interview can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a group interview to assess an applicant's stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained.<ref name=\"Bye, H. H. 2016\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bye | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Sandal | first2 = G.

In group interviews the interviewer has to multitask more than when interviewing one applicant at a time. Interviewers in one-on-one interviews are already busy doing many things. These include attending to what applicants are saying and how they are acting, taking notes, rating applicant responses to questions, and managing what they say and how they act. Interviewing more than one applicant at a time makes it more challenging for the interviewer. This can negatively affect that interviewer and his/her job as interviewer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Latorella | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Investigating interruptions: Implication for flightdeck performance | url = | journal = Dissertation Abstracts International | volume = 58 | issue = 1| page = 0365B }}</ref> Another problem with group interviews is that applicants who get questioned later in the interview have more of a chance to think about how to answer the questions already asked by the interviewer. This can give applicants questioned later in the interview an advantage over the earlier-questioned applicants. These problems can make it less likely for group interviews to accurately predict who will perform well on the job.\n\nGroup interviews have not been studied as much as one-on-one interviews, but the research that has been done suggests that in the field of education group interviews can be an effective method of selection.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byrnes | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Kiger | first2 = G. | last3 = Shechtman | first3 = Z. | year = 2003 | title = Evaluating the use of group interviews to select students into teacher-education programs | url = | journal = Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 163\u2013172 | doi=10.1177/0022487102250310}}</ref> For example, a 2016 study found that applicants for teaching jobs thought that the group interview was fair.<ref name=\"Bye, H. H. 2016\"/> A 2006 study found conflicting findings.<ref name=\"Tran, T. 2006\"/> These include that applicants in a group interview who were questioned later in the interview gave more complete and higher quality responses and that group interviews were seen as not fair. They also found that group interviews were not as effective as one-on-one interviews. Further research needs to be conducted to more extensively evaluate the group interview's usefulness for various purposes. This research needs to be done across various domains outside of the education sector. Research also needs to clarify conflicting findings by determining in which situations study results can be applied.\n\n====Stress====\nStress interviews are still in common use. One type of stress interview is where the employer uses a succession of interviewers (one at a time or ''en masse'') whose mission is to intimidate the candidate and keep him/her off-balance. The ostensible purpose of this interview: to find out how the candidate handles stress. Stress interviews might involve testing an applicant's behavior in a busy environment. Questions about handling work overload, dealing with multiple projects, and handling conflict are typical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.money-zine.com/Definitions/Career-Dictionary/Stress-Interview/ |title=Stress Interview |publisher=Money-zine.com |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of stress interview may involve only a single interviewer who behaves in an uninterested or hostile manner. For example, the interviewer may not make eye contact, may roll his eyes or sigh at the candidate's answers, interrupt, turn his back, take phone calls during the interview, or ask questions in a demeaning or challenging style. The goal is to assess how the interviewee handles pressure or to purposely evoke emotional responses. This technique was also used in research protocols studying [[workplace stress|stress]] and type A (coronary-prone) behavior because it would evoke hostility and even changes in [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in study subjects. The key to success for the candidate is to de-personalize the process. The interviewer is acting a role, deliberately and calculatedly trying to \"rattle the cage\". Once the candidate realizes that there is nothing personal behind the interviewer's approach, it is easier to handle the questions with aplomb.\n\nExample stress interview questions:\n* Sticky situation: \"If you caught a colleague cheating on his expenses, what would you do?\"\n* Putting one on the spot: \"How do you feel this interview is going?\"\n* \"Popping the balloon\": (deep sigh) \"Well, if that's the best answer you can give ... \" (shakes head) \"Okay, what about this one ...?\"\n* Oddball question: \"What would you change about the design of the hockey stick?\"\n* Doubting one's veracity: \"I don't feel like we're getting to the heart of the matter here. Start again \u2013 tell me what ''really'' makes you tick.\"\n \nCandidates may also be asked to deliver a [[presentation]] as part of the selection process. One stress technique is to tell the applicant that they have 20 minutes to prepare a presentation, and then come back to room five minutes later and demand that the presentation be given immediately. The \"Platform Test\" method involves having the candidate make a presentation to both the selection panel and other candidates for the same job. This is obviously highly stressful and is therefore useful as a predictor of how the candidate will perform under similar circumstances on the job. Selection processes in academic, training, airline, legal and teaching circles frequently involve presentations of this sort. <!-- http://0-www.mopp.qut.edu.au.innopac.up.ac.za:80/B/B_04_04.html Can someone find citation info for this, format it, and verify? -->\n\n====Technical====\n{{Further|Coding interview}}\nThis kind of interview focuses on problem solving and creativity. The questions aim at the interviewee's problem-solving skills and likely show their ability in solving the challenges faced in the job through creativity. Technical interviews are being conducted online at progressive companies before in-person talks as a way to screen job applicants.\n\n===Technology in interviews===\n\nAdvancements in technology along with increased usage has led to interviews becoming more common through a [[telephone interview]] and through [[videoconferencing]] than face-to-face. Companies utilize technology in interviews due to their cheap costs, time-saving benefits, and their ease of use.<ref name=\"Chapman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = D.S. | year = 2000 | title = Modeling Job Application Decision Processes: Integrating Applicant Reactions to Selection Procedures into the Critical Contact Framework of Recruiting | url = | journal = Dissertation Abstracts International, Section B: The Sciences and Engineering | volume = 61 | issue = 10\u2013B | page = 5605 }}</ref>\nAlso, technology enables a company to recruit more applicants from further away.<ref name =\"Chapman2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Uggerslev | first2 = K.L. | last3 = Webster | first3 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Applicant Reactions to Face-to-Face and Technology-Mediated Interviews: A Field Investigation | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 5| pages = 944\u2013953 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.944| pmid = 14516254 }}</ref> Although they are being utilized more, it is still not fully understood how technology may affect how well interviewers select the best person for the job when compared to in-person interviews.<ref name =\"Potosky\">{{cite journal | last1 = Potosky | first1 = D | year = 2008 | title = A conceptual framework for the role of the administration medium in the personnel assessment process | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 629\u2013648 | doi=10.5465/amr.2008.32465704}}</ref>\n\n[[Media richness theory]] states that more detailed forms of communication will be able to better convey complex information. The ability to convey this complexity allows more media-rich forms of communication to better handle uncertainty (like what can occur in an interview) than shallower and less detailed communication mediums.<ref name =\"Daft & Lengel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Daft | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Lengel | first2 = R.

Verbal and nonverbal cues are read more in the moment and in relation to what else is happening in the interview. A video interview may have a lag between the two participants. Poor latency can influence the understanding of verbal and nonverbal behaviors, as small differences in the timing of behaviors can change their perception. Likewise, behaviors such as eye contact may not work as well. A video interview would be more media rich than a telephone interview due to the inclusion of both visual and audio data. Thus, in a more media-rich interview, interviewers have more ways to gather, remember, and interpret the data they gain about the applicants.\n\nSo are these new types of technology interviews better? Research on different interview methods has examined this question using media richness theory. According to the theory, interviews with more richness are expected to result in a better outcome. In general, studies have found results are consistent with media richness theory. Applicants\u2019 interview scores and hiring ratings have been found to be worse in phone and video interviews than in face-to-face interviews.<ref name=\"Blacksmith\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blacksmith | first1 = N. | last2 = WIllford | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Behrend | first3 = T.S. | year = 2016 | title = Technology in the employment interview: A meta-analysis and future research agenda | url = | journal = Personnel Assessment and Decisions | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 12\u201320 | doi = 10.25035/pad.2016.002 }}</ref> Applicants are also seen as less likable and were less likely to be endorsed for jobs in interviews using video.<ref name =\"Sears\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sears | first1 = G.J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiesner | first3 = W.H. | last4 = Hackett | first4 = R.D. | last5 = Yuan | first5 = Y. | year = 2013 | title = A comparative assessment of videoconference and face-to-face employment interviews | url = | journal = Management Decisions | volume = 51 | issue = 8| pages = 1733\u20131752 | doi=10.1108/md-09-2012-0642}}</ref> Applicants have had a say too.

Interviewers are seen as less friendly in video interviews.<ref name=\"Chapman\"/> Furthermore, applicants are more likely to accept a job after a face-to-face interview than after a telephone or video interview.<ref name =\"Chapman2\"/> Due to these findings, companies should weigh the costs and benefits of using technology over face-to-face interviews when deciding on selection methods.\n\n==Interviewee strategies and behaviors==\nWhile preparing for an interview, prospective [[employees]] usually look at what the job posting or job description says in order to get a better understanding of what is expected of them should they get hired. Exceptionally good interviewees look at the wants and needs of a job posting and show off how good they are at those abilities during the interview to impress the interviewer and increase their chances of getting a job.\n\nResearching the [[company]] itself is also a good way for interviewees to impress lots of people during an interview. It shows the interviewer that the interviewee is not only knowledgeable about the company's goals and [[Goal|objectives]], but also that the interviewee has done their [[homework]] and that they make a great effort when they are given an assignment. Researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for, and at the end of the interview, the interviewee might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company, either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research. In any case, it impresses the interviewer and it shows that the interviewee is willing to learn more about the company.\n\nMost interviewees also find that practising answering the most common questions asked in interviews helps them prepare for the real one. It minimizes the chance of their being caught off-guard regarding certain questions, prepares their minds to convey the right information in the hopes of impressing the interviewer, and also makes sure that they do not accidentally say something that might not be suitable in an interview situation.\n\nInterviewees are generally dressed properly in [[business attire]] for the interview, so as to look [[professional]] in the eyes of the interviewer. They also bring their [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]], [[cover letter]] and [[references]] to the interview to supply the interviewer the information they need, and to also cover them in case they forgot to bring any of the papers. Items like [[cellphone]]s, a cup of [[coffee]] and [[chewing gum]] are not recommended to bring to an interview, as it can lead to the interviewer perceiving the interviewee as unprofessional and in some cases, even [[rude]].\n\nAbove all, interviewees should be [[confident]] and courteous to the interviewer, as they are taking their time off work to participate in the interview. An interview is often the first time an interviewer looks at the interviewee first hand, so it is important to make a good first impression.<ref>http://jobsearch.about.com/od/interviewsnetworking/ss/job-interview_1.htm - accessed September 18, 2014</ref>\n\n===Nonverbal behaviors===\nIt may not only be what you say in an interview that matters, but also how you say it (e.g., how fast you speak) and how you behave during the interview (e.g., hand gestures, eye contact).

You may want to be careful of what you may be communicating through the nonverbal behaviors you display.\n\n===Physical attractiveness===\nTo hire the best applicants for the job, interviewers form judgments, sometimes using applicants\u2019 physical attractiveness. That is, physical attractiveness is usually not necessarily related to how well one can do the job, yet has been found to influence interviewer evaluations and judgments about how suitable an applicant is for the job. Once individuals are categorized as attractive or unattractive, interviewers may have expectations about physically attractive and physically unattractive individuals and then judge applicants based on how well they fit those expectations.<ref name=\"Hosoda, M. 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hosoda | first1 = M. | last2 = Stone-Romero | first2 = E.

Vocal attractiveness, defined as an appealing mix of speech rate, loudness, pitch, and variability, has been found to be favorably related to interview ratings and job performance.<ref name=\"DeGroot, T. 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = DeGroot | first1 = T. | last2 = Kluemper | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence of Predictive and Incremental Validity of Personality Factors, Vocal Attractiveness and the Situational Interview | url = | journal = International Journal of Selection and Assessment | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u201339 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2389.2007.00365.x}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In addition, the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness predict performance more strongly for people with more attractive voices compared to those with less attractive voices.<ref name=\"DeGroot, T. 2007\"/>\n\nAs important as it is to understand how physical attractiveness can influence the judgments, behaviors, and final decisions of interviewers, it is equally important to find ways to decrease potential bias in the job interview.

Information used by interviewees comes from a variety of sources ranging from popular how-to books to formal coaching programs, sometimes even provided by the hiring organization. Within the more formal coaching programs, there are two general types of coaching. One type of coaching is designed to teach interviewees how to perform better in the interview by focusing on how to behave and present oneself. This type of coaching is focused on improving aspects of the interview that are not necessarily related to the specific elements of performing the job tasks. This type of coaching could include how to dress, how to display nonverbal behaviors (head nods, smiling, eye contact), verbal cues (how fast to speak, speech volume, articulation, pitch), and impression management tactics. Another type of coaching is designed to focus interviewees on the content specifically relevant to describing one's qualifications for the job, in order to help improve their answers to interview questions. This coaching, therefore, focuses on improving the interviewee's understanding of the skills, abilities, and traits the interviewer is attempting to assess, and responding with relevant experience that demonstrates these skills.<ref name=\"Maurer, T. 2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = T. | last2 = Solamon | first2 = J. | last3 = Lippstreu | first3 = M. | year = 2008 | title = How does coaching interviewees affect the validity of a structured interview? | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 355\u2013371 | doi=10.1002/job.512}}</ref> For example, this type of coaching might teach an interviewee to use the STAR approach for answering behavioral interview questions.<ref>[http://www.mfgjobs.com/articles/how-to-answer-behavioral-interview-questions/ How To Answer Behavioral Interview Questions - MFGJobs.com]</ref>\n\nA coaching program might include several sections focusing on various aspects of the interview. It could include a section designed to introduce interviewees to the interview process, and explain how this process works (e.g., administration of interview, interview day logistics, different types of interviews, advantages of structured interviews). It could also include a section designed to provide feedback to help the interviewee to improve their performance in the interview, as well as a section involving practice answering example interview questions.

The interviewee's goal is typically to perform well (i.e. obtain high interview ratings), in order to get hired.

Such applicant faking can influence interview outcomes when present. One concept related to faking is [[impression management]] (IM; when you intend or do not intend to influence how favorably you are seen during interactions<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = A.P.J. | last2 = West | first2 = B.J. | last3 = Ryan | first3 = A.M. | last4 = DeShon | first4 = R.P | year = 2002 | title = The use of impression management tactics in structured interviews: A function of question type? | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a09da5fbea897c2bc192b86ff1a0d83daeecbdb3| journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 6| pages = 1200\u20131208 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.87.6.1200| pmid = 12558226 }}</ref>).

This can be accomplished through omitting certain negative experiences, concealing negatively perceived aspects of the applicant's background, and by separating oneself from negative experiences.\n#The fourth and final component of faking involves [[ingratiating]] oneself to the interviewer by conforming personal opinions to align with those of the organization, as well as insincerely praising or complimenting the interviewer or organization.\n\nOf all of the various faking behaviors listed, ingratiation tactics were found to be the most prevalent in the employment interview, while flat out making up answers or claiming others\u2019 experiences as one's own is the least common.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/> However, fabricating true skills appears to be at least somewhat prevalent in employment interviews. One study found that over 80% of participants lied about job-related skills in the interview,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = B. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R.S. | year = 2006 | title = Looking good and lying to do it: Deception as an impression management strategy in job interviews | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 1070\u20131086 | doi=10.1111/j.0021-9029.2006.00055.x}}</ref> presumably to compensate for a lack of job-required skills/traits and further their chances for employment.\n\nMost importantly, faking behaviors have been shown to affect outcomes of employment interviews. For example, the probability of getting another interview or job offer increases when interviewees make up answers.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/>\n\nDifferent interview characteristics also seem to impact the likelihood of faking.  Faking behavior is less prevalent, for instance, in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews, although follow-up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews. Therefore, if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in employment interview settings, they should utilize structured, past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow-up questions.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/>\n\n==Factors impacting effectiveness==\n\n===Interviewee characteristics===\nInterviewees may differ on any number of dimensions commonly assessed by job interviews and evidence suggests that these differences affect interview ratings. Many interviews are designed to measure some specific differences between applicants, or individual difference variables, such as [[Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities]] needed to do the job well. Other individual differences can affect how interviewers rate the applicants even if that characteristic is not meant to be assessed by the interview questions.<ref name = \"Van Iddekinge, Raymark, Edison, & Attenweiler, 2004.\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van Iddekinge | first1 = C.

For instance, someone with high general mental ability may perform better in a cognitively demanding situation, such as a job interview, which requires quick thinking and responding. Similarly, someone with strong social skills may perform better in a job interview, as well as other social situations, because they understand how to act correctly. Thus, when an applicant performs well in an interview due to higher general mental abilities or better social skills, it is not necessarily undesirable, because they may also perform better when they are faced with situations on the job in which those skills would be valuable.\n\tOn the other hand, not all individual difference variables that lead to higher interview performance would be desirable on the job. Some individual difference variables, such as those that are part of the [[dark triad]], can lead to increased interview ratings, initially, but may not be reflective of actual KSAOs that would help the individual to perform better once hired.\n\n====The Dark Triad====\n=====Machiavellianism=====\n{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}\nIndividuals who are high in [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellianism]] may be more willing and more skilled at faking and less likely to give honest answers during interviews.<ref>Fletch, 1990</ref><ref name = \"Levashina & Campion, 2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Levashina | first1 = J. | last2 = Campion | first2 = M.

Narcissists also tend to be neater and flashier dressers, display friendlier facial expressions, and exhibit more self-assured body movements.<ref name = \"Berscheid & Reis, 1998\">Berscheid, E., & Reis, H.

They\nlook like they are of good ability, emotionally well adjusted and reasonable, and these traits make them attractive to those in charge of hiring staff within organizations. Unlike narcissists, psychopaths are better able to create long-lasting favorable first impressions, though people may still eventually see through their facades.<ref name=fbi>{{Cite web | url=https://leb.fbi.gov/2012/november/the-corporate-psychopath\n | title=The Corporate Psychopath}}</ref> Psychopaths\u2019 undesirable personality traits may be easily misperceived by even skilled interviewers. For instance, their irresponsibility may be misconstrued by interviewers as risk-taking or entrepreneurial spirit. Their thrill-seeking tendencies may be conveyed as high energy and enthusiasm for the job or work. Their [[superficial charm]] may be misinterpreted by interviewers as charisma.<ref name=fbi/><ref>Hare R [[Snakes in Suits]] (2006)</ref> It is worth noting that psychopaths are not only accomplished liars, they are also more likely to lie in interviews.<ref name = \"Roulin & Bourdage, 2017\"/> For instance, psychopaths may create fictitious work experiences or resumes.<ref name=fbi/> They may also fabricate credentials such as diplomas, certifications, or awards.<ref name = fbi/>  Thus, in addition to seeming competent and likable in interviews, psychopaths are also more likely to outright make-up information during interviews than non-psychopaths.\n\n===Interviewer characteristics===\nThere are many differences about interviewers that may affect how well they conduct an interview and make decisions about applicants. A few of them are how much experience they have as an interviewer, their personality, and intelligence.<ref name=\"Graves, L. M. 1993\">{{cite journal | last1 = Graves | first1 = L.

In some cases, prior experience as an interviewer leads them to use more of the information provided by the applicant to decide if an applicant is right for the job intelligence.<ref name=\"Graves, L.

L. 2012\"/>\n\nThe mental ability of interviewers may play a role in how good they are as interviewers. Higher mental ability is important because during the interview, a lot of information needs to be processed \u2013 what the applicant said, what they meant, what it means for how they can do the job, etc. Research has shown that those higher in general mental ability were more accurate when judging the personality of others.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Christiansen | first1 = N.

Some of the specific social skills good judges display are warmth, interest in engaging with others, and eye contact.<ref name=\"Letzring, T.

Where the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often lower costs.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel%20et%20al%201994%20JAP%20Validity%20of%20interviews.pdf | title = The Validity of Employment Interviews: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis| first = Michael A. |last = McDaniel | first2 = Deborah L. |last2=Whetzel | first3 = Frank L. |last3 = Schmidt | first4 = Steven D. |last4 = Maurer | year = 1994 | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages= 599\u2013616 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.79.4.599}}</ref>\n\n====Interview structure issues====\n[[File:Job interview 0001.jpg|thumb|right|An interview at a [[job fair]]]]\n\nAs discussed previously, interviews with more structure are considered best practice, as they tend to result in much better decisions about who will be a good performing employee than interviews with less structure.<ref name=\"Huffcutt, A.

Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; interviewers decide the number and content of questions, rate responses using whatever strategy they want (e.g., relying on intuition, or using overall ratings at the end of the interview rather than after each time the applicant responds), and may score some applicants more harshly than others. Thus, interviewers who do not consider at least a moderate amount of structure may make it hard for an organization's interview to effectively select candidates that best fit the work needs of the organization.\n\n====Interviewer rating reliability====\nIn terms of reliability, meta-analytic results provided evidence that interviews can have acceptable levels of interrater reliability, or consistent ratings across interviewers [[interrater reliability]] (i.e. .75 or above), when a structured panel interview is used.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = J.

In fact, one structured interview that included a) a predetermined set of questions that interviewers were able to choose from, and b) interviewer scoring of applicant answers after each individual question using previously created benchmark answers, showed validity levels comparable to cognitive ability tests (traditionally one of the best predictors of job performance) for entry level jobs.<ref name=\"Huffcutt, A.

Research has concentrated on four key issues: how interviewers rate applicants with disabilities, the reactions of applicants with disabilities to the interview, the effects of disclosing a disability during the interview, and the perceptions different kinds of applicant disabilities may have on interviewer ratings.\n\nThe job interview is a tool used to measure constructs or overall characteristics that are relevant for the job.  Oftentimes, applicants will receive a score based on their performance during the interview. Research has found different findings based on interviewers\u2019 perceptions of the disability.  For example, some research has found a leniency effect (i.e., applicants with disabilities receive higher ratings than equally qualified non-disabled applicants) in ratings of applicants with disabilities<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Breecher | first1 = E. | last2 = Bragger | first2 = J. | last3 = Kutcher | first3 = E. | year = 2006 | title = The structured interview: Reducing biases toward job applicants with physical disabilities | url = | journal = Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 155\u2013170 | doi = 10.1007/s10672-006-9014-y }}</ref><ref name=\"Nordstrom\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nordstrom | first1 = C.

Applicants with disabilities and able-bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview.<ref name=\"Duckett\">{{cite journal | last1 = Duckett | first1 = P. S. | year = 2000 | title = Disabling employment interviews: Warfare to work | url = | journal = Disability & Society | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 1019\u20131039 | doi = 10.1080/713662022 }}</ref>  Applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely, which leads such applicants to experience anxiety and tension themselves. The interview is felt to be the part of the selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur.<ref name=\"Duckett\"/> Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability.  If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience.<ref name=\"Duckett\"/> Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.\n\nResearch has also demonstrated that different types of disabilities have different effects on interview outcomes.  Disabilities with a negative stigma and that are perceived as resulting from the actions of the person (e.g., HIV-Positive, substance abuse) result in lower interview scores than disabilities for which the causes are perceived to be out of the individual's control (e.g., physical birth defect).<ref name=\"Miceli, N. S. 2002\"/> A physical disability often results in higher interviewer ratings than psychological (e.g., mental illness) or sensory conditions (e.g., Tourette Syndrome).<ref name=\"Nordstrom\"/><ref name=\"Dalgin\">Dalgin, S. R., & Bellini, J. (2008). Invisible disability disclosure in an employment interview: Impact on employers\u2019 hiring decision and views of employability. Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin, 52, 6\u201315.</ref> In addition, there are differences between the effects of disclosing disabilities that are visible (e.g., wheelchair bound) and non-visible (e.g., Epilepsy) during the interview.  When applicants had a non-visible disability and disclosed their disability early in the interview they were not rated more negatively than applicants who did not disclose. In fact, they were liked more than the applicants who did not disclose their disability and were presumed not disabled.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = L.

Not all disabilities are the same and more research is needed to find whether these results are relevant for other types of disabilities.\n\nSome practical implications for job interviews for applicants with disabilities include research findings that show there are no differences in interviewer responses to a brief, shorter discussion or a detailed, longer discussion about the disability during the interview.<ref name=\"Dalgin\"/>  Applicants, however, should note that when a non-visible disability is disclosed near the end of the interview, applicants were rated more negatively than early disclosing and non-disclosing applicants.  Therefore, it is possible that interviewers feel individuals who delay disclosure may do so out of shame or embarrassment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Milani | first1 = Silvia | title = Embarrassing job interview | url = https://relationshiplatestnews.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/the-most-embarrassing-job-interviews | journal = Relationship Tips and Advice| date = 2018-03-23 }}</ref>  In addition, if the disability is disclosed after being hired, employers may feel deceived by the new hire and reactions could be less positive than would have been in the interview.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = D.

That is, when the interviewer perceives the applicant is psychologically well and/or comfortable with his or her disability, there can be positive interviewer effects.  In contrast, if the interviewer perceives the applicant as uncomfortable or anxious discussing the disability, this may either fail to garner positive effect or result in more negative interview ratings for the candidate. Caution must again be taken when applying these research findings to other types of disabilities not investigated in the studies discussed above.  There are many factors that can influence the interview of an applicant with a disability, such as whether the disability is physical or psychological, visible or non-visible, or whether the applicant is perceived as responsible for the disability or not. Therefore, applicants should make their own conclusions about how to proceed in the interview after comparing their situations with those examined in the research discussed here.\n\n=== Applicants with criminal backgrounds ===\n\nAlthough it is illegal{{Where|date=November 2018}} for employers to ask about applicants\u2019 arrest record during an interview as a deciding factor in applicant hiring decisions, employers do have the right to obtain information about applicants\u2019 criminal convictions before hiring, including during the interview phase.<ref name=\"legal1\"/> Many companies consider hiring applicants with criminal history a liability. For instance, if a company hired someone with an assault charge and that person later assaulted another employee or vendor, some people would say that the company was liable or legally responsible for not maintaining a safe work environment. Although the legalities are more complex, this potential responsibility an organization may carry often is a reason why many companies conduct criminal background checks. When making hiring decisions that somewhat depend on one's criminal background, employers must consider the following:\n\n* Employers should only ask about an applicant's criminal conviction history if it is job related.<ref name=\"eeoc.gov\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/inquiries_arrest_conviction.cfm | title=Pre-Employment Inquiries and Arrest & Conviction}}</ref>\n* Treating job applicants with criminal histories differently based on their race or national origin is a disparate treatment liability.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm</ref> Disparate treatment is defined as intentional discrimination<ref name=\"Landy, F. J. 2010\">Landy, F. J. (2010). Employment discrimination litigation: behavioral, quantitative, and legal perspectives. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref> If employers ask about criminal convictions in the interview process, the interviewer must ask all interviewees and not just interviewees of a perceived sex, race, or national origin. \n* Excluding applicants with certain criminal records may end up overly excluding groups of individuals protected under Title VII<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm | title=Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964}}</ref> which is a disparate impact liability.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Disparate impact is defined as unintentional discrimination.<ref name=\"Landy, F. J. 2010\"/> \n* Some states have different laws about how arrest and conviction records can be used in hiring decisions and when employers can obtain information about criminal records.<ref name=\"eeoc.gov\"/>\n\nAlthough not much research has been conducted to examine whether applicants should talk about their criminal histories or not, a 2012 study<ref name=\"Swanson, S. J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Swanson | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Langfitt-Reese | first2 = S. | last3 = Bond | first3 = G.

Applicants also had an increased chance of being hired if they discussed what they learned from their experience in the justice system, as well as how they were rehabilitated, during the interview.  This study found that employers preferred applicants that revealed their criminal records upfront and were willing to take responsibility for their actions.<ref name=\"Swanson, S. J. 2012\"/>\n\n[[Ban the Box]] is a campaign to remove the question about criminal history from job applications as an opportunity to give people with criminal histories a reasonable chance in the employment selection process.

As such, differences between the tightness-looseness of the interviewer's and interviewee's home countries can introduce method bias, negatively affecting the interviewer's assessment of interviewee answers and behaviors. First construct bias must be measured by comparing groups of persons from distinct cultures and comparing if any real differences are discovered. Then information on those differences can be used to make the adjustments needed to allow the construct to measure what it is intended to measure in people from a different culture.\n\n====Method bias====\n[[Response bias]] is another cross-cultural difference that has been shown to affect how we measure constructs and interpret the results.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = R | year = 2004 | title = Standardization to Account for Cross-Cultural Response Bias: A Classification of Score Adjustment Procedures and Review of Research in JCCP | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bb0ed2f0b746250b677c99c39fe5dec360075a9d| journal = J.

Ind. Psychol. | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 13 | doi = 10.4102/sajip.v41i1.1259 }}</ref> One simple example of socially acceptable answers is called acquiescence bias, which is a tendency to agree with all questions with positive meaning.<ref name=\":4\" /> People also have been found to show different attitudes towards answers on the extreme high and low end of a set of options (extremely agree or extremely disagree).<ref name=\":4\" /> In some cases, people from a different cultures may just be unfamiliar with a word (term, concept, context) or with a type of question.<ref name=\":4\" /> Another research study found that self and other reports of conscientiousness failed to relate with expected job behaviors across cultures, demonstrating that one of the most predictive constructs in the USA is tied to aspects of USA culture that may not be present in a different type of culture.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example, in the West, applicants prefer to eliminate details and focus on the larger issue, tending towards a comprehensive evaluation starting from individual elements then moving towards the whole.<ref name=\":5\">Lievens, F., 2006. International situational judgment tests, in: Situational Judgment Tests: Theory, Measurement and Application. Routledge, pp. 279\u2013300.</ref> In Japan, a respondent would go from the general to the specific in answering, preferring to divide a problem and analyze it piece by piece. Likewise, there are differences between individualist and collectivist cultures in the types of answers they chose. When given a series of options, individualists tend to choose the task oriented option that involves direct communication with others.<ref name=\":5\" /> Yet collectivists choose the option that sees group harmony and protecting or saving face for others as more important.<ref name=\":5\" /> These differences can introduce method bias when interviewers evaluate or score how the applicant did in the interview. This is why it is important to understand how and why the best answer in one culture is not the best elsewhere. It might even be completely wrong.\n\n====Item bias====\nThere is also item bias introduced by the actual items or questions in an interview. Poor item translation can be a problem.<ref name=\":3\" /> This might be incorrectly translating the same item to another language such as in an organization that hires both English and Spanish speaking employees. Or it might be in someone not understanding the wording of an item because they are not native to that country's language. Similar to construct bias, the wording of an item can result in measuring different traits because of different meanings in the two different cultures.\n\n==See also==\n* [[College interview]]\n* [[Interview]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131209205211/https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/getajob/interviews/Pages/top10interviewquestions.aspx NCS - Interview Advice]\n*[https://jaishreegupta.com/interview-question-tell-me-about-yourself-answer-with-example/ Interview Most Famous Question(Tell me about yourself answer)]\n{{Employment}}\n{{Jobs}}\n\n[[Category:Job interview| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Job interview.jpg|thumb|right|A candidate is interviewed at a job interview]]\nA '''job interview''' is an [[interview]] consisting of a conversation between a job applicant and a representative of an [[employer]] which is conducted to assess whether the applicant should be hired.<ref name = \"Dipboye et al\">Dipboye, R.

Earlier rounds sometimes called 'screening interviews' may involve fewer staff from the employers and will typically be much shorter and less in-depth. An increasingly common initial interview approach is the telephone interview. This is especially common when the candidates do not live near the employer and has the advantage of keeping costs low for both sides. Since 2003, interviews have been held through video conferencing software, such as [[Skype]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/hiatt/howto/interview/index.html |title=INTRODUCTION TO INTERVIEWING |publisher=[[Brandeis University]] |accessdate=2015-05-02}}</ref> Once all candidates have been interviewed, the employer typically selects the most desirable candidate(s) and begins the negotiation of a job offer.\n\n==Constructs==\nResearchers have attempted to identify which interview strategies or \"constructs\" can help interviewers choose the best candidate.

These factors are typically not relevant to whether the individual can do the job (that is, not related to [[job performance]]), thus, their influence on interview ratings should be minimized or excluded. In fact, there are laws in many countries that prohibit consideration of many of these protected classes of people when making selection decisions. Using structured interviews with multiple interviewers coupled with training may help reduce the effect of the following characteristics on interview ratings.<ref name=\"McCarthy, J.

For example, some research suggests that applicant's cognitive ability, education, training, and work experiences may be better captured in unstructured interviews, whereas applicant's job knowledge, organizational fit, interpersonal skills, and applied knowledge may be better captured in a structured interview.<ref name=\"Huffcutt, A. I. 2001\"/>\n\nFurther, interviews are typically designed to assess a number of constructs. Given the social nature of the interview, applicant responses to interview questions and interviewer evaluations of those responses are sometimes influenced by constructs beyond those the questions were intended to assess, making it extremely difficult to tease out the specific constructs measured during the interview.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = P.

Moreover, of practical importance is whether the interview is a better measure of some constructs in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same constructs. Indeed, certain constructs (mental ability and skills, experience) may be better measured with paper and pencil tests than during the interview, whereas personality-related constructs seem to be better measured during the interview in comparison to paper and pencil tests of the same personality constructs.<ref>Dipboye, R.

When interview fit questions were examined, only 4% of the questions used in interviews were similar across the majority of organizations. 22% of questions were commonly used by recruiters in some organizations. In contrast, 74% of the questions had no commonality between organizations.<ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/> Although the idea of fit is similar in many organizations, the questions used and how that information is judged may be very different.<ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/>\n\nPerson-job fit and Person-organization fit have different levels of importance at different stages of a multi-stage interview proves. Despite this, Person-job fit is considered of highest importance throughout the entire process. Organizations focus more on job-related skills early on to screen out potential unqualified candidates. Thus, more questions are devoted to Person-job fit during the initial interview stages.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/> Once applicants have passed the initial stages, more questions are used for Person-organization fit in the final interview stages.

Again, Person-job fit questions are used to screen out and reduce the number of applicants.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"Kristof-Brown 643\u2013671\"/>\n\nPotential applicants also use job interviews to assess their fit within an organization. This can determine if an applicant will take a job offer when one is offered.

That is, impressions interviewers form early on may affect how they view the person in a later phase.\n\n'''Preinterview phase''':\nThe preinterview phase encompasses the information available to the interviewer beforehand (e.g., resumes, test scores, social networking site information) and the perceptions interviewers form about applicants from this information prior to the actual face-to-face interaction between the two individuals. In this phase, interviewers are likely to already have ideas about the characteristics that would make a person ideal or qualified for the position.<ref name=\"DMS\">Dipboye, R.

In this way, interviewers typically have an impression even before the actual face-to-face interview interaction. Nowadays with [[recent technological advancements]], interviewers have an even larger amount of information available on some candidates. For example, interviewers can obtain information from search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo), blogs, and even social networks (e.g. Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter). While some of this information may be job-related, some of it may not be. In some cases, a review of Facebook may reveal undesirable behaviors such as drunkenness or drug use.

Such anxiety may hamper how well they actually perform and present themselves during the interview, fulfilling the original thoughts of the interviewer. Alternatively, interviewees who perceive an interviewer believes they are qualified for the job may feel more at ease and comfortable during the exchange, and consequently actually perform better in the interview. Because of the dynamic nature of the interview, the interaction between the behaviors and thoughts of both parties is a continuous process whereby information is processed and informs subsequent behavior, thoughts, and evaluations.\n\n'''Postinterview phase''':\nAfter the interview is conducted, the interviewer must form an evaluation of the interviewee's qualifications for the position. The interviewer most likely takes into consideration all the information, even from the preinterview phase, and integrates it to form a postinterview evaluation of the applicant. In the final stage of the interview process, the interviewer uses his/her evaluation of the candidate (i.e., in the form of interview ratings or judgment) to make a final decision. Sometimes other selection tools (e.g., work samples, cognitive ability tests, personality tests) are used in combination with the interview to make final hiring decisions; however, interviews remain the most commonly used selection device in North America.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ryan | first1 = A. | last2 = McFarland | first2 = L. | last3 = Baron | first3 = H. | last4 = Page | first4 = R. | year = 1999 | title = An international look at selection practices: Nation and culture as explanations for variability in practice | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 359\u2013391 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1999.tb00165.x}}</ref>\n\n'''For interviewees''':\nAlthough the description of the interview process above focuses on the perspective of the interviewer, job applicants also gather information on the job and/or organization and form impressions prior to the interview.<ref name=\"DMS\"/> The interview is a two-way exchange and applicants are also making decisions about whether the company is a good fit for them. Essentially, the process model illustrates that the interview is not an isolated interaction, but rather a complex process that begins with two parties forming judgments and gathering information, and ends with a final interviewer decision.\n\n==Types==\nThere are many types of interviews that organizations can conduct. What is the same across all interview types, however, is the idea of interview structure. How much an interview is structured, or developed and conducted the same way across all applicants, depends on the number of certain elements included in that interview. Overall, the interview can be standardized both with regard to the content (i.e., what questions are asked) and to the evaluative process (i.e., how the applicants\u2019 responses to the questions are scored). When an interview is standardized, it increases the likelihood that an interviewee's ratings are due to the quality of his/her responses instead of non-job-related and often distracting factors, such as appearance. Interview structure is more appropriately thought to be on a continuum, ranging from completely unstructured to fully structured.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Macan|first=Therese|year=2009|title=The employment interview: A review of current studies and directions for future research|url=|journal=Human Resource Management Review|volume=19|issue=3|pages=203\u2013218|doi=10.1016/j.hrmr.2009.03.006}}</ref> However, structure is often treated as a having only two categories (that is, structured vs. unstructured), which many researchers believe to be too simple of an approach.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Chapman\" />\n\n'''<big>Unstructured</big>'''\n\nThe unstructured interview, or one that does not include a good number of standardization elements, is the most common form of interview today.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsai, W., Chen, F., Chen, H., Tseng K.|year=2016|title=When will interviewers be willing to use high-structured job interviews?

Unstructured interviews essentially allow the interviewer to conduct the interview however he or she thinks is best.\n\nGiven unstructured interviews can change based on who the interviewer might be, it is not surprising that unstructured interviews are typically preferred by interviewers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Structured selection interviews: Why do they work?

Specifically, researchers commonly address 15 elements<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Campion, M., Palmer, D., Campion, J.|year=1997|title=A review of structure in the selection interview|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/378cf3f13929876ea3a507be7e0000831bd7cd01|journal=Personnel Psychology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=655\u2013702|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1997.tb00709.x}}</ref> that can be used to make the interview's content and evaluation process similar. An interview's degree of structure is often thought of as the extent to which these elements are included when conducting interviews.\n\nContent structure:\n \n* Ensure questions are relevant to the job, as indicated by a [[job analysis]]\n* Ask the same questions of all interviewees\n* Limit prompting, or follow up questions, that interviewers may ask\n* Ask better questions, such as behavioral description questions\n* Have a longer interview\n* Control ancillary information available to the interviewees, such as resumes\n* Do not allow questions from applicants during interview\n \nEvaluation structure:\n \n* Rate each answer rather than making an overall evaluation at the end of the interview\n* Use anchored rating scales (for an example, see [[Behaviorally anchored rating scales|BARS]])\n* Have the interviewer take detailed notes\n* Have more than one interviewer view each applicant (i.e. have panel interviews)\n* Have the same interviewers rate each applicant\n* Do not allow any discussion about the applicants between interviewers\n* Train the interviewers\n* Use statistical procedures to create an overall interview score\n\nMultiple research studies have shown that using these elements to design the interview increases the interview's ability to identify high-performing individuals. As mentioned, the structure of an interview is on a scale that ranges from unstructured to structured, but it remains unclear which or how many structure elements must be included before the interview can be considered \u2018structured.\u2019 Some researchers argue that including at least some, but not all, elements into the interview should be considered \u201csemi-structured.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kohn, L., Dipboye, R.|year=1998|title=The effects of interview structure on recruiting outcomes|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=28|issue=9|pages=821\u2013843|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01733.x}}</ref> Others have attempted to create levels of structure, such as Huffcutt, Culbertson, and Weyhrauch's<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Huffcutt, A., Culbertson, S., Weyhrauch, W.|year=2014|title=Moving forward indirectly: Reanalyzing the validity of employment interviews with indirect range restriction methodology|url=|journal=International Journal of Selection and Assessment|volume=22 | issue = 3 |pages=297\u2013309|doi=10.1111/ijsa.12078}}</ref> four levels of structure, which point to varying degrees of standardization in each level.

P. 1980\" /> ask job applicants to imagine a set of circumstances and then indicate how they would respond in that situation; hence, the questions are future oriented. One advantage of situational questions is that all interviewees respond to the same hypothetical situation rather than describe experiences unique to them from their past.  Another advantage is that situational questions allow respondents who have had no direct job experience relevant to a particular question to provide a hypothetical response.<ref name=\"Pulakos, E. D. 1995\"/> Two core aspects of the SI are the development of situational dilemmas that employees encounter on the job, and a scoring guide to evaluate responses to each dilemma.<ref name=\"Latham, G.

The case problem is often a business situation or a business case that the interviewer has worked on in real life.\nIn recent years, company in other sectors like Design, Architecture, Marketing, Advertising, Finance and Strategy have adopted a similar approach to interviewing candidates. Technology has transformed the Case-based and Technical interview process from a purely private in-person experience to an online exchange of job skills and endorsements.\n\n====Panel====\nAnother type of job interview found throughout the professional and academic ranks is the ''panel interview''.  In this type of interview the candidate is interviewed by a group of panelists representing the various stakeholders in the hiring process.  Within this format there are several approaches to conducting the interview.  Example formats include; \n* Presentation format \u2013 The candidate is given a generic topic and asked to make a presentation to the panel.  Often used in academic or sales-related interviews.\n* Role format \u2013 Each panelist is tasked with asking questions related to a specific role of the position.  For example, one panelist may ask technical questions, another may ask management questions, another may ask customer service related questions etc.\n* Skeet shoot format \u2013 The candidate is given questions from a series of panelists in rapid succession to test his or her ability to handle stress filled situations.\n\nThe benefits of the panel approach to interviewing include: time savings over serial interviewing, more focused interviews as there is often less time spend building rapport with small talk, and \"[[Apples and oranges|apples to apples]]\" comparison because each stake holder/interviewer/panelist gets to hear the answers to the same questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com/Panel-Interview.html |title=Panel Interview - The good, the bad and what do look out for! |publisher=Staffing-and-recruiting-essentials.com |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>\n\n====Group====\nIn the group interview, multiple applicants are interviewed at one time by one or more interviewers. This type of interview can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a group interview to assess an applicant's stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained.<ref name=\"Bye, H. H. 2016\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bye | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Sandal | first2 = G.

In group interviews the interviewer has to multitask more than when interviewing one applicant at a time. Interviewers in one-on-one interviews are already busy doing many things. These include attending to what applicants are saying and how they are acting, taking notes, rating applicant responses to questions, and managing what they say and how they act. Interviewing more than one applicant at a time makes it more challenging for the interviewer. This can negatively affect that interviewer and his/her job as interviewer.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Latorella | first1 = K | year = 1997 | title = Investigating interruptions: Implication for flightdeck performance | url = | journal = Dissertation Abstracts International | volume = 58 | issue = 1| page = 0365B }}</ref> Another problem with group interviews is that applicants who get questioned later in the interview have more of a chance to think about how to answer the questions already asked by the interviewer. This can give applicants questioned later in the interview an advantage over the earlier-questioned applicants. These problems can make it less likely for group interviews to accurately predict who will perform well on the job.\n\nGroup interviews have not been studied as much as one-on-one interviews, but the research that has been done suggests that in the field of education group interviews can be an effective method of selection.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byrnes | first1 = D.

H. 2016\"/> A 2006 study found conflicting findings.<ref name=\"Tran, T. 2006\"/> These include that applicants in a group interview who were questioned later in the interview gave more complete and higher quality responses and that group interviews were seen as not fair. They also found that group interviews were not as effective as one-on-one interviews. Further research needs to be conducted to more extensively evaluate the group interview's usefulness for various purposes. This research needs to be done across various domains outside of the education sector. Research also needs to clarify conflicting findings by determining in which situations study results can be applied.\n\n====Stress====\nStress interviews are still in common use. One type of stress interview is where the employer uses a succession of interviewers (one at a time or ''en masse'') whose mission is to intimidate the candidate and keep him/her off-balance. The ostensible purpose of this interview: to find out how the candidate handles stress. Stress interviews might involve testing an applicant's behavior in a busy environment. Questions about handling work overload, dealing with multiple projects, and handling conflict are typical.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.money-zine.com/Definitions/Career-Dictionary/Stress-Interview/ |title=Stress Interview |publisher=Money-zine.com |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of stress interview may involve only a single interviewer who behaves in an uninterested or hostile manner. For example, the interviewer may not make eye contact, may roll his eyes or sigh at the candidate's answers, interrupt, turn his back, take phone calls during the interview, or ask questions in a demeaning or challenging style. The goal is to assess how the interviewee handles pressure or to purposely evoke emotional responses. This technique was also used in research protocols studying [[workplace stress|stress]] and type A (coronary-prone) behavior because it would evoke hostility and even changes in [[blood pressure]] and heart rate in study subjects. The key to success for the candidate is to de-personalize the process. The interviewer is acting a role, deliberately and calculatedly trying to \"rattle the cage\". Once the candidate realizes that there is nothing personal behind the interviewer's approach, it is easier to handle the questions with aplomb.\n\nExample stress interview questions:\n* Sticky situation: \"If you caught a colleague cheating on his expenses, what would you do?\"\n* Putting one on the spot: \"How do you feel this interview is going?\"\n* \"Popping the balloon\": (deep sigh) \"Well, if that's the best answer you can give ... \" (shakes head) \"Okay, what about this one ...?\"\n* Oddball question: \"What would you change about the design of the hockey stick?\"\n* Doubting one's veracity: \"I don't feel like we're getting to the heart of the matter here. Start again \u2013 tell me what ''really'' makes you tick.\"\n \nCandidates may also be asked to deliver a [[presentation]] as part of the selection process. One stress technique is to tell the applicant that they have 20 minutes to prepare a presentation, and then come back to room five minutes later and demand that the presentation be given immediately. The \"Platform Test\" method involves having the candidate make a presentation to both the selection panel and other candidates for the same job. This is obviously highly stressful and is therefore useful as a predictor of how the candidate will perform under similar circumstances on the job. Selection processes in academic, training, airline, legal and teaching circles frequently involve presentations of this sort. <!-- http://0-www.mopp.qut.edu.au.innopac.up.ac.za:80/B/B_04_04.html Can someone find citation info for this, format it, and verify? -->\n\n====Technical====\n{{Further|Coding interview}}\nThis kind of interview focuses on problem solving and creativity. The questions aim at the interviewee's problem-solving skills and likely show their ability in solving the challenges faced in the job through creativity. Technical interviews are being conducted online at progressive companies before in-person talks as a way to screen job applicants.\n\n===Technology in interviews===\n\nAdvancements in technology along with increased usage has led to interviews becoming more common through a [[telephone interview]] and through [[videoconferencing]] than face-to-face. Companies utilize technology in interviews due to their cheap costs, time-saving benefits, and their ease of use.<ref name=\"Chapman\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = D.S. | year = 2000 | title = Modeling Job Application Decision Processes: Integrating Applicant Reactions to Selection Procedures into the Critical Contact Framework of Recruiting | url = | journal = Dissertation Abstracts International, Section B: The Sciences and Engineering | volume = 61 | issue = 10\u2013B | page = 5605 }}</ref>\nAlso, technology enables a company to recruit more applicants from further away.<ref name =\"Chapman2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Uggerslev | first2 = K.L. | last3 = Webster | first3 = J. | year = 2003 | title = Applicant Reactions to Face-to-Face and Technology-Mediated Interviews: A Field Investigation | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 5| pages = 944\u2013953 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.944| pmid = 14516254 }}</ref> Although they are being utilized more, it is still not fully understood how technology may affect how well interviewers select the best person for the job when compared to in-person interviews.<ref name =\"Potosky\">{{cite journal | last1 = Potosky | first1 = D | year = 2008 | title = A conceptual framework for the role of the administration medium in the personnel assessment process | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 629\u2013648 | doi=10.5465/amr.2008.32465704}}</ref>\n\n[[Media richness theory]] states that more detailed forms of communication will be able to better convey complex information. The ability to convey this complexity allows more media-rich forms of communication to better handle uncertainty (like what can occur in an interview) than shallower and less detailed communication mediums.<ref name =\"Daft & Lengel\">{{cite journal | last1 = Daft | first1 = R.

Verbal and nonverbal cues are read more in the moment and in relation to what else is happening in the interview. A video interview may have a lag between the two participants. Poor latency can influence the understanding of verbal and nonverbal behaviors, as small differences in the timing of behaviors can change their perception. Likewise, behaviors such as eye contact may not work as well. A video interview would be more media rich than a telephone interview due to the inclusion of both visual and audio data. Thus, in a more media-rich interview, interviewers have more ways to gather, remember, and interpret the data they gain about the applicants.\n\nSo are these new types of technology interviews better? Research on different interview methods has examined this question using media richness theory. According to the theory, interviews with more richness are expected to result in a better outcome. In general, studies have found results are consistent with media richness theory. Applicants\u2019 interview scores and hiring ratings have been found to be worse in phone and video interviews than in face-to-face interviews.<ref name=\"Blacksmith\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blacksmith | first1 = N. | last2 = WIllford | first2 = J.C. | last3 = Behrend | first3 = T.S. | year = 2016 | title = Technology in the employment interview: A meta-analysis and future research agenda | url = | journal = Personnel Assessment and Decisions | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 12\u201320 | doi = 10.25035/pad.2016.002 }}</ref> Applicants are also seen as less likable and were less likely to be endorsed for jobs in interviews using video.<ref name =\"Sears\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sears | first1 = G.J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = H. | last3 = Wiesner | first3 = W.H. | last4 = Hackett | first4 = R.D. | last5 = Yuan | first5 = Y. | year = 2013 | title = A comparative assessment of videoconference and face-to-face employment interviews | url = | journal = Management Decisions | volume = 51 | issue = 8| pages = 1733\u20131752 | doi=10.1108/md-09-2012-0642}}</ref> Applicants have had a say too.

Exceptionally good interviewees look at the wants and needs of a job posting and show off how good they are at those abilities during the interview to impress the interviewer and increase their chances of getting a job.\n\nResearching the [[company]] itself is also a good way for interviewees to impress lots of people during an interview. It shows the interviewer that the interviewee is not only knowledgeable about the company's goals and [[Goal|objectives]], but also that the interviewee has done their [[homework]] and that they make a great effort when they are given an assignment. Researching about the company makes sure that employees are not entirely clueless about the company they are applying for, and at the end of the interview, the interviewee might ask some questions to the interviewer about the company, either to learn more information or to clarify on some points that they might have found during their research. In any case, it impresses the interviewer and it shows that the interviewee is willing to learn more about the company.\n\nMost interviewees also find that practising answering the most common questions asked in interviews helps them prepare for the real one. It minimizes the chance of their being caught off-guard regarding certain questions, prepares their minds to convey the right information in the hopes of impressing the interviewer, and also makes sure that they do not accidentally say something that might not be suitable in an interview situation.\n\nInterviewees are generally dressed properly in [[business attire]] for the interview, so as to look [[professional]] in the eyes of the interviewer. They also bring their [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]], [[cover letter]] and [[references]] to the interview to supply the interviewer the information they need, and to also cover them in case they forgot to bring any of the papers. Items like [[cellphone]]s, a cup of [[coffee]] and [[chewing gum]] are not recommended to bring to an interview, as it can lead to the interviewer perceiving the interviewee as unprofessional and in some cases, even [[rude]].\n\nAbove all, interviewees should be [[confident]] and courteous to the interviewer, as they are taking their time off work to participate in the interview. An interview is often the first time an interviewer looks at the interviewee first hand, so it is important to make a good first impression.<ref>http://jobsearch.about.com/od/interviewsnetworking/ss/job-interview_1.htm - accessed September 18, 2014</ref>\n\n===Nonverbal behaviors===\nIt may not only be what you say in an interview that matters, but also how you say it (e.g., how fast you speak) and how you behave during the interview (e.g., hand gestures, eye contact).

Some researchers maintain that nonverbal behaviors affect interview ratings a great deal,<ref name=\"Hollandsworth 1979\"/> while others have found that they have a relatively small impact on interview outcomes,  especially when considered with applicant qualifications presented in r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.<ref name=\"Rasmussen 1984\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rasmussen Jr | first1 = K.

You may want to be careful of what you may be communicating through the nonverbal behaviors you display.\n\n===Physical attractiveness===\nTo hire the best applicants for the job, interviewers form judgments, sometimes using applicants\u2019 physical attractiveness. That is, physical attractiveness is usually not necessarily related to how well one can do the job, yet has been found to influence interviewer evaluations and judgments about how suitable an applicant is for the job. Once individuals are categorized as attractive or unattractive, interviewers may have expectations about physically attractive and physically unattractive individuals and then judge applicants based on how well they fit those expectations.<ref name=\"Hosoda, M. 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hosoda | first1 = M. | last2 = Stone-Romero | first2 = E.

Vocal attractiveness, defined as an appealing mix of speech rate, loudness, pitch, and variability, has been found to be favorably related to interview ratings and job performance.<ref name=\"DeGroot, T. 2007\">{{cite journal | last1 = DeGroot | first1 = T. | last2 = Kluemper | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence of Predictive and Incremental Validity of Personality Factors, Vocal Attractiveness and the Situational Interview | url = | journal = International Journal of Selection and Assessment | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u201339 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-2389.2007.00365.x}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In addition, the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness predict performance more strongly for people with more attractive voices compared to those with less attractive voices.<ref name=\"DeGroot, T. 2007\"/>\n\nAs important as it is to understand how physical attractiveness can influence the judgments, behaviors, and final decisions of interviewers, it is equally important to find ways to decrease potential bias in the job interview.

Information used by interviewees comes from a variety of sources ranging from popular how-to books to formal coaching programs, sometimes even provided by the hiring organization. Within the more formal coaching programs, there are two general types of coaching. One type of coaching is designed to teach interviewees how to perform better in the interview by focusing on how to behave and present oneself. This type of coaching is focused on improving aspects of the interview that are not necessarily related to the specific elements of performing the job tasks. This type of coaching could include how to dress, how to display nonverbal behaviors (head nods, smiling, eye contact), verbal cues (how fast to speak, speech volume, articulation, pitch), and impression management tactics. Another type of coaching is designed to focus interviewees on the content specifically relevant to describing one's qualifications for the job, in order to help improve their answers to interview questions. This coaching, therefore, focuses on improving the interviewee's understanding of the skills, abilities, and traits the interviewer is attempting to assess, and responding with relevant experience that demonstrates these skills.<ref name=\"Maurer, T. 2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = T. | last2 = Solamon | first2 = J. | last3 = Lippstreu | first3 = M. | year = 2008 | title = How does coaching interviewees affect the validity of a structured interview? | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 355\u2013371 | doi=10.1002/job.512}}</ref> For example, this type of coaching might teach an interviewee to use the STAR approach for answering behavioral interview questions.<ref>[http://www.mfgjobs.com/articles/how-to-answer-behavioral-interview-questions/ How To Answer Behavioral Interview Questions - MFGJobs.com]</ref>\n\nA coaching program might include several sections focusing on various aspects of the interview. It could include a section designed to introduce interviewees to the interview process, and explain how this process works (e.g., administration of interview, interview day logistics, different types of interviews, advantages of structured interviews). It could also include a section designed to provide feedback to help the interviewee to improve their performance in the interview, as well as a section involving practice answering example interview questions. An additional section providing general interview tips about how to behave and present oneself could also be included.<ref name=\"Maurer, T. 2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Maurer | first1 = T. | last2 = Solamon | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = The science and practice of a structured employment interview coaching program | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 431\u2013454 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.2006.00797.x}}</ref>\n\nIt is useful to consider coaching in the context of the competing goals of the interviewer and interviewee.  The interviewee's goal is typically to perform well (i.e. obtain high interview ratings), in order to get hired.

This can be accomplished through omitting certain negative experiences, concealing negatively perceived aspects of the applicant's background, and by separating oneself from negative experiences.\n#The fourth and final component of faking involves [[ingratiating]] oneself to the interviewer by conforming personal opinions to align with those of the organization, as well as insincerely praising or complimenting the interviewer or organization.\n\nOf all of the various faking behaviors listed, ingratiation tactics were found to be the most prevalent in the employment interview, while flat out making up answers or claiming others\u2019 experiences as one's own is the least common.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/> However, fabricating true skills appears to be at least somewhat prevalent in employment interviews.

For example, the probability of getting another interview or job offer increases when interviewees make up answers.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/>\n\nDifferent interview characteristics also seem to impact the likelihood of faking.  Faking behavior is less prevalent, for instance, in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews, although follow-up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews. Therefore, if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in employment interview settings, they should utilize structured, past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow-up questions.<ref name=\"Levashina, J. 2007\"/>\n\n==Factors impacting effectiveness==\n\n===Interviewee characteristics===\nInterviewees may differ on any number of dimensions commonly assessed by job interviews and evidence suggests that these differences affect interview ratings. Many interviews are designed to measure some specific differences between applicants, or individual difference variables, such as [[Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities]] needed to do the job well. Other individual differences can affect how interviewers rate the applicants even if that characteristic is not meant to be assessed by the interview questions.<ref name = \"Van Iddekinge, Raymark, Edison, & Attenweiler, 2004.\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van Iddekinge | first1 = C.

For instance, someone with high general mental ability may perform better in a cognitively demanding situation, such as a job interview, which requires quick thinking and responding. Similarly, someone with strong social skills may perform better in a job interview, as well as other social situations, because they understand how to act correctly. Thus, when an applicant performs well in an interview due to higher general mental abilities or better social skills, it is not necessarily undesirable, because they may also perform better when they are faced with situations on the job in which those skills would be valuable.\n\tOn the other hand, not all individual difference variables that lead to higher interview performance would be desirable on the job. Some individual difference variables, such as those that are part of the [[dark triad]], can lead to increased interview ratings, initially, but may not be reflective of actual KSAOs that would help the individual to perform better once hired.\n\n====The Dark Triad====\n=====Machiavellianism=====\n{{Main|Machiavellianism in the workplace}}\nIndividuals who are high in [[Machiavellianism (psychology)|Machiavellianism]] may be more willing and more skilled at faking and less likely to give honest answers during interviews.<ref>Fletch, 1990</ref><ref name = \"Levashina & Campion, 2006\">{{cite journal | last1 = Levashina | first1 = J. | last2 = Campion | first2 = M.

Research has concentrated on four key issues: how interviewers rate applicants with disabilities, the reactions of applicants with disabilities to the interview, the effects of disclosing a disability during the interview, and the perceptions different kinds of applicant disabilities may have on interviewer ratings.\n\nThe job interview is a tool used to measure constructs or overall characteristics that are relevant for the job.  Oftentimes, applicants will receive a score based on their performance during the interview. Research has found different findings based on interviewers\u2019 perceptions of the disability.  For example, some research has found a leniency effect (i.e., applicants with disabilities receive higher ratings than equally qualified non-disabled applicants) in ratings of applicants with disabilities<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Breecher | first1 = E. | last2 = Bragger | first2 = J. | last3 = Kutcher | first3 = E. | year = 2006 | title = The structured interview: Reducing biases toward job applicants with physical disabilities | url = | journal = Employee Responsibilities and Rights Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 155\u2013170 | doi = 10.1007/s10672-006-9014-y }}</ref><ref name=\"Nordstrom\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nordstrom | first1 = C.

The interview is felt to be the part of the selection process where covert discrimination against applicants with disabilities can occur.<ref name=\"Duckett\"/> Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability.  If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience.<ref name=\"Duckett\"/> Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.\n\nResearch has also demonstrated that different types of disabilities have different effects on interview outcomes.  Disabilities with a negative stigma and that are perceived as resulting from the actions of the person (e.g., HIV-Positive, substance abuse) result in lower interview scores than disabilities for which the causes are perceived to be out of the individual's control (e.g., physical birth defect).<ref name=\"Miceli, N.

When applicants had a non-visible disability and disclosed their disability early in the interview they were not rated more negatively than applicants who did not disclose. In fact, they were liked more than the applicants who did not disclose their disability and were presumed not disabled.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = L.

Not all disabilities are the same and more research is needed to find whether these results are relevant for other types of disabilities.\n\nSome practical implications for job interviews for applicants with disabilities include research findings that show there are no differences in interviewer responses to a brief, shorter discussion or a detailed, longer discussion about the disability during the interview.<ref name=\"Dalgin\"/>  Applicants, however, should note that when a non-visible disability is disclosed near the end of the interview, applicants were rated more negatively than early disclosing and non-disclosing applicants.  Therefore, it is possible that interviewers feel individuals who delay disclosure may do so out of shame or embarrassment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Milani | first1 = Silvia | title = Embarrassing job interview | url = https://relationshiplatestnews.wordpress.com/2018/03/23/the-most-embarrassing-job-interviews | journal = Relationship Tips and Advice| date = 2018-03-23 }}</ref>  In addition, if the disability is disclosed after being hired, employers may feel deceived by the new hire and reactions could be less positive than would have been in the interview.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = D.

That is, when the interviewer perceives the applicant is psychologically well and/or comfortable with his or her disability, there can be positive interviewer effects.  In contrast, if the interviewer perceives the applicant as uncomfortable or anxious discussing the disability, this may either fail to garner positive effect or result in more negative interview ratings for the candidate. Caution must again be taken when applying these research findings to other types of disabilities not investigated in the studies discussed above.  There are many factors that can influence the interview of an applicant with a disability, such as whether the disability is physical or psychological, visible or non-visible, or whether the applicant is perceived as responsible for the disability or not. Therefore, applicants should make their own conclusions about how to proceed in the interview after comparing their situations with those examined in the research discussed here.\n\n=== Applicants with criminal backgrounds ===\n\nAlthough it is illegal{{Where|date=November 2018}} for employers to ask about applicants\u2019 arrest record during an interview as a deciding factor in applicant hiring decisions, employers do have the right to obtain information about applicants\u2019 criminal convictions before hiring, including during the interview phase.<ref name=\"legal1\"/> Many companies consider hiring applicants with criminal history a liability. For instance, if a company hired someone with an assault charge and that person later assaulted another employee or vendor, some people would say that the company was liable or legally responsible for not maintaining a safe work environment. Although the legalities are more complex, this potential responsibility an organization may carry often is a reason why many companies conduct criminal background checks. When making hiring decisions that somewhat depend on one's criminal background, employers must consider the following:\n\n* Employers should only ask about an applicant's criminal conviction history if it is job related.<ref name=\"eeoc.gov\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/practices/inquiries_arrest_conviction.cfm | title=Pre-Employment Inquiries and Arrest & Conviction}}</ref>\n* Treating job applicants with criminal histories differently based on their race or national origin is a disparate treatment liability.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm</ref> Disparate treatment is defined as intentional discrimination<ref name=\"Landy, F. J. 2010\">Landy, F. J. (2010). Employment discrimination litigation: behavioral, quantitative, and legal perspectives. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.</ref> If employers ask about criminal convictions in the interview process, the interviewer must ask all interviewees and not just interviewees of a perceived sex, race, or national origin. \n* Excluding applicants with certain criminal records may end up overly excluding groups of individuals protected under Title VII<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm | title=Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964}}</ref> which is a disparate impact liability.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Disparate impact is defined as unintentional discrimination.<ref name=\"Landy, F. J. 2010\"/> \n* Some states have different laws about how arrest and conviction records can be used in hiring decisions and when employers can obtain information about criminal records.<ref name=\"eeoc.gov\"/>\n\nAlthough not much research has been conducted to examine whether applicants should talk about their criminal histories or not, a 2012 study<ref name=\"Swanson, S. J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Swanson | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Langfitt-Reese | first2 = S. | last3 = Bond | first3 = G.

Applicants also had an increased chance of being hired if they discussed what they learned from their experience in the justice system, as well as how they were rehabilitated, during the interview.  This study found that employers preferred applicants that revealed their criminal records upfront and were willing to take responsibility for their actions.<ref name=\"Swanson, S. J. 2012\"/>\n\n[[Ban the Box]] is a campaign to remove the question about criminal history from job applications as an opportunity to give people with criminal histories a reasonable chance in the employment selection process.

International situational judgment tests, in: Situational Judgment Tests: Theory, Measurement and Application. Routledge, pp. 279\u2013300.</ref> In Japan, a respondent would go from the general to the specific in answering, preferring to divide a problem and analyze it piece by piece. Likewise, there are differences between individualist and collectivist cultures in the types of answers they chose. When given a series of options, individualists tend to choose the task oriented option that involves direct communication with others.<ref name=\":5\" /> Yet collectivists choose the option that sees group harmony and protecting or saving face for others as more important.<ref name=\":5\" /> These differences can introduce method bias when interviewers evaluate or score how the applicant did in the interview. This is why it is important to understand how and why the best answer in one culture is not the best elsewhere. It might even be completely wrong.\n\n====Item bias====\nThere is also item bias introduced by the actual items or questions in an interview. Poor item translation can be a problem.<ref name=\":3\" /> This might be incorrectly translating the same item to another language such as in an organization that hires both English and Spanish speaking employees. Or it might be in someone not understanding the wording of an item because they are not native to that country's language. Similar to construct bias, the wording of an item can result in measuring different traits because of different meanings in the two different cultures.\n\n==See also==\n* [[College interview]]\n* [[Interview]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131209205211/https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/getajob/interviews/Pages/top10interviewquestions.aspx NCS - Interview Advice]\n{{Employment}}\n{{Jobs}}\n\n[[Category:Job interview| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:328f:cd4:941:3bc0:894c:eed6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_interview"}
