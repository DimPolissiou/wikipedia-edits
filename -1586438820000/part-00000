They promise each other to keep in touch. Among them are Hanumanta Rao ([[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]]), who has a son named Prabha ([[Prabhas]]), and Vishwanath ([[Ahuti Prasad]]) who has a daughter named Nandini ([[Kajal Agarwal]]). To reach their professional goals, Vishwanath and Nandini travel to [[Switzerland]], while Hanumanta Rao becomes a criminal lawyer and settles in India. Thus, Prabha and Nandini get separated in their childhood.\n\nYears later, these old friends call for a reunion where a grown-up Prabha is eager to see his lover Nandini, but Nisha ([[Shraddha Das]]), the daughter of a local don ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), attempts suicide when Prabha does not accept her love. Her father tries to kill Prabha and his friends, but Prabha gets out of trouble by faking a story about his childhood love Nandini.\n\nDuring the reunion at Bhadram's ([[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]]) farmhouse, Prabha happens to see Nandini. He tries various tantrums to impress her, but in vain. His attempts are always thwarted by her brother (Master Gaurav). One day, he knowingly gives a lead about his sister's favorite game of [[basketball]], forcing Prabha and his team to create a basketball court. As they play basketball, in comes Rishi ([[Vamsi Krishna]]), Appala Raju's ([[M. S. Narayana]]) son who gatecrashes into the game as he is cheered by Nandini. Both Rishi and Prabha vie with each other to impress Nandini, leading to a cold war between them.\n\nMeanwhile Bhadram's daughter, Prasanna (Shilpa) confesses to Prabha that she was in love with a man and would marry him if she could pay a dowry of 5&nbsp;million, and she forces Prabha to talk to her father into marrying off her to her boyfriend. Prabha is able to convince Bhadram about his daughter's marriage with the help of his father and his friends. Impressed by his managing skills, Nandini begins to show affection to Prabha. Jealous of Nandini's liking for Prabha, Rishi's friends try to paralyse Prabha by misconnecting the power cable of an iron box. Hanumanta Rao, unaware of their conspiracy, accidentally touches the iron box and gets an [[Electric Shock|electric shock]], leading to a scuffle between Prabha and Rishi. The fight results in Hanumanta Rao ejecting Prabha out of the house.\n\nLater, Prabha finds out that Rishi is not Appala Raju's son, but Vishwanath's nephew. Vishwanath betrayed his father ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) by marrying his girlfriend rather than the girl chosen by his father. As a result, he is ousted by his father. Hanumanta Rao, on Viswanath's behalf, negotiates with his father for a reconciliation. After many attempts, he agrees to forgive Viswanath, but on the condition that his daughter's son should marry Nandini.\n\nPrabha decides not to reveal his love for Nandini and makes up his mind to leave. As Prabha tries to leave, Nandini reveals that she was in love with him all along. She was playing hard to get with him, only to know how much he loves her. However, to save his father's reputation, he does not reveal his love to her and leaves the place, leaving Nandini heartbroken. Nisha's father too realizes the truth that the story Prabha had said was a lie, and tries to kill him. Meanwhile, Nandini gets to know the truth behind Prabha's silence and injures herself on purpose as she is angry at Hanumanta Rao. She tells Vishwanath that she loves Prabha and she wants to marry him. Feeling bad for her, he agrees to her proposal. Hanumanta Rao reminds him of the condition, but Viswanath says no and reminds him of their friendship for helping each other. Even Viswanath's father feels emotional about it, so he forgives his son and allows Nandini to marry Prabha.\n\nOutside, Nandini runs to Prabha and sees him getting beaten up by Nisha's father. He sends his men to kill her, but Prabha manages to stop them and save Nandini. Nisha's father later raises a gun at Prabha, but Nandini pleads him to not shoot and shows her love for Prabha. Feeling emotional, Nisha's father lowers the gun and lets them go. Prabha and Nandini finally get married and live a happy life.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[uppalapati Prabhas raju]] as Prabha/Prabhas\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Nandini\n* [[Shraddha Das]] as Nisha\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Hanumanta Rao\n* [[Ahuti Prasad]] as Vishwanath\n* [[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]] as Bhadram\n* [[Mukesh Rishi]] as Nisha's father\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Vishwanath's father\n* [[Tulasi (actress)|Tulasi]] as Rajeshwari\n* [[M.

They had elaborate costumes, and held gilt books. John Burrell described the costume in verse. They curtsied, and sang, but did not speak; instead another schoolboy spoke for them in verse, explaining to Anne that the muses served the king and she would be their refuge and mother.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 111, 145.</ref> \n[[File:Netherbow E.jpg|thumb|right|The Netherbow or East Port gate of Edinburgh]]\n\n===The Virtues===\nOutside [[St Giles Kirk]] there was a large stage, on which stood the mother Virtue or Piety crowned with her four daughters dressed in black silk with chaplets of flowers on their head. Virtue took off her crown and gave it to the queen. Virtue's speech exhorted Anne to welcome her daughters, [[Prudentia|Prudence]], [[Justitia|Justice]], [[Courage|Fortitude]] and [[Temperantia|Temperance]] into her home where they would watch over her. Each daughter then came forward, Prudence with an [[astrolabe]] in her hand, who counselled against the laziness that brings misfortune; Justice, with her sword and scales, explained that strong castles are built on the principle of equity; Fortitude, with the club of [[Hercules]] and a shield, advised humility in success and patience in failure to disregard sorrow. Temperance, with her hourglass and bridle, counselled self-control. Mother Virtue concluded that the Word of God was the greatest wealth. Then [[Psalm 120]] was sung.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 112-114.</ref>\n\nThe five actors were young men dressed as women. Another account of the event says they held the usual traditional attributes, Prudence a serpent and dove, Fortitude a broken pillar, and Temperance a cup of wine. This discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that the performance involved the virtues picking up these alternative objects.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 146.</ref>\n\n===Banquet of Bacchus and Ceres===\nAnne of Denmark got out of her coach and walked into St Giles under the red velvet canopy or \"paill\" flanked by Peder Munk and Lord Hamilton, while a choir sang [[Psalm 19]]. Robert Bruce preached on the subject of [[Psalm 107]], a reflection of thanksgiving for the safe return of mariners; then [[Psalm 23]] was sung. Outside the church, where the [[Mercat Cross]] is now situated, the next pageant showed the ancestry of the kings of Denmark and the arms of previous Scottish queen consorts. Nearby were [[Bacchus]] and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], played by schoolboys, offering a banquet referring to the abundance of the lands of the queen's \"morning gift\". A big older actor, who had been seated on a wine barrel, got up and threw food gifts into the crowd of spectators.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 114-5, 146.</ref>\n\n===The Family Tree===\nAt the place where salt was weighed, the \"Salt Tron\", where the [[Tron Kirk]] is now, an artificial tree had five stages or branches with boys representing kings and queens with the arms of the monarchs of Denmark and Scotland. At the base of the tree a king in armour resting on a couch was [[Christian I of Denmark]], a common ancestor of James VI and Anne, from whom these monarchs descended, as the Biblical kings [[Tree of Jesse|sprang from Jesse]]. For Anne's benefit, a boy rehearsed her family tree.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 115-7, 146.</ref>\n\n===Solomon and the Queen of Sheba===\nThe final pageant of the Entry took place at the East Port or Netherbow, the gate on the Royal Mile to the Canongate that leads to Holyroodhouse. A dialogue between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was dramatised. The queen said she had come to Solomon to study his unequalled wisdom. She brought him the balsam that does not grow in Scotland, and thanked him for his company which was like drinking at Pallas Athena's breast. Solomon replied that she should always remain in his respect and honour, and so good-night. Then another schoolboy explained to Anne of Denmark that as the Queen of Sheba had desired to meet Solomon, so James had travelled to meet her, and now all Scotland would serve her. He gave Anne of Denmark the town's gift of a jewel, which was lowered from the Netherbow with a length of silk ribbon.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 117-120, 148.</ref> \n\nAnne returned down the Canongate to Holyroodhouse, according to John Burrell, still accompanied by the 40 or 50 young men in costume as \"moors\". Adrian Damman explains that at Holyrood they tied bronze bells to the white buskins or shanks they wore on their lower legs, and began to dance, in contrast to their slow processional walk, as if they were [[Korybantes|Corybants]] followers of the goddess [[Cybele]].<ref>Adriam Damman, 'De Introitu Reg. Annae in Edinburgam' (Edinburgh, 1590).</ref>\n\n===The Jewel===\nThe town had obtained a jewel in security for a loan of \u00a34000 [[Pounds Scots|Scots]] to the king, a locket with a diamond and emerald, and decided to have the goldsmith David Gilbert remake and enlarge it as a gift for the queen. The purpose of the loan had to been to finance ambassadors sent to England to plead for the life of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref>Marguerite Wood, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454498&view=1up&seq=36 ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 4, 20.]: Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 113.</ref> David Calderwood said the jewel was called the \"A\", probably referring to the crowned initial or cipher of \"A\" on its case.<ref>Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 115: David Calderwood, ''History of the Kirk'', vol. 5, p. 97: Maureen M.

At the base of the tree a king in armour resting on a couch was [[Christian I of Denmark]], a common ancestor of James VI and Anne, from whom these monarchs descended, as the Biblical kings [[Tree of Jesse|sprang from Jesse]]. For Anne's benefit, a boy rehearsed her family tree.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 115-7, 146.</ref>\n\n===Solomon and the Queen of Sheba===\nThe final pageant of the Entry took place at the East Port or Netherbow, the gate on the Royal Mile to the Canongate that leads to Holyroodhouse. A dialogue between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was dramatised. The queen said she had come to Solomon to study his unequalled wisdom. She brought him the balsam that does not grow in Scotland, and thanked him for his company which was like drinking at Pallas Athena's breast. Solomon replied that she should always remain in his respect and honour, and so good-night. Then another schoolboy explained to Anne of Denmark that as the Queen of Sheba had desired to meet Solomon, so James had travelled to meet her, and now all Scotland would serve her. He gave Anne of Denmark the town's gift of a jewel, which was lowered from the Netherbow with a length of silk ribbon.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 117-120, 148.</ref> \n\nAnne returned down the Canongate to Holyroodhouse, according to John Burrell, still accompanied by the 40 or 50 young men in costume as \"moors\". Adrian Damman explains that at Holyrood they tied bronze bells to the white buskins or shanks they wore on their lower legs, and began to dance, in contrast to their slow processional walk, as if they were [[Korybantes|Corybants]] followers of the goddess [[Cybele]].<ref>Adriam Damman, 'De Introitu Reg. Annae in Edinburgam' (Edinburgh, 1590).</ref>\n\n===The Jewel===\nThe town had obtained a jewel in security for a loan of \u00a34000 [[Pounds Scots|Scots]] to the king, a locket with a diamond and emerald, and decided to have the goldsmith David Gilbert remake and enlarge it as a gift for the queen. The purpose of the loan had to been to finance ambassadors sent to England to plead for the life of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref>Marguerite Wood, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454498&view=1up&seq=36 ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 4, 20.]: Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 113.</ref> David Calderwood said the jewel was called the \"A\", probably referring to the crowned initial or cipher of \"A\" on its case.<ref>Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 115: David Calderwood, ''History of the Kirk'', vol. 5, p. 97: Maureen M.

Julian the Apostate, a scholarly man who was made emperor against his desire in 361, greatly admired Prohaeresius, and in a letter spoke of his \"exuberant and overflowing stream of speech...mighty in discourse, just like [[Pericles]]\". In the hope of winning Prohaeresius to [[Theurgy]], Julian maintained him in a professorial chair, dismissing all others; but Prohaeresius remained loyal to his faith, and voluntarily resigned his lucrative post.<ref name=\"Vahan\"/>\n\nOtherwise, Eunapius described Prohaeresius in pagan terms by comparing him to famous [[Greek myth]]ological figures ([[Geryon]] and [[Hermes]]) and Athenian ruler [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]]. Overall Eunapius presented his teacher Prohaeresius as an icon of Hellenic holiness.<ref name =\"Hagg\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eunapius_02_text.htm#PROHAERESIUS  Eunapius: The Life of Prohaeresius]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/philosophes/eunape/deux.htm Eunapius: The Life of Prohaeresius]\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek rhetoricians]]\n[[Category:Greek educators]]\n[[Category:272 births]]\n[[Category:367 deaths]]\n[[Category:4th-century Christians]]\n[[Category:Roman-era Athenian rhetoricians]]\n[[Category:Armenian Christians]]\n[[Category:Armenian educators]]\n", "name_user": "Srnec", "label": "safe", "comment": "Greek transcription", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohaeresius"}

The Eighth Army took part in many of the [[amphibious landing]]s in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], eventually participating in no less than sixty of them. The first mission of the Eighth Army, in September 1944, was to take over from the [[Sixth United States Army|U.S. Sixth Army]] in [[New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Admiralty Islands]] and on [[Morotai]], in order to free up the Sixth Army to engage in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)]].\n\nThe Eighth Army again followed in the wake of the Sixth Army in December 1944, when it took over control of operations on [[Leyte Island]] on 26 December. In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on [[Luzon]], landing the [[XI Corps (United States)|XI Corps]] on 29 January near [[San Antonio, Zambales|San Antonio]] and the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] on the other side of [[Manila Bay]] two days later. Combining with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped [[Manila]] in a great double-[[pincer movement]]. Eighth Army's final operation of the [[Pacific War]] was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]], including on the major island of [[Mindanao]], an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.\n\n===Occupation of Japan===\nEighth Army was to have participated in [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. It would have taken part in [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], the second phase of the invasion, which would have seen the invasion of the [[Kant\u014d Plain]] on eastern [[Honsh\u016b]]. However, the Japanese surrender cancelled the invasion, and the Eighth Army found itself in charge of occupying it peacefully. [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation forces]] landed on 30 August 1945, with its headquarters in [[Yokohama]], then the HQ moved to the [[DN Tower 21|Dai-Ichi]] building in [[Tokyo]]. At the beginning of 1946, Eighth Army assumed responsibility for occupying all of Japan. Four quiet years then followed, during which the Eighth Army gradually deteriorated from a combat-ready fighting force into a somewhat soft, minimally-trained constabulary. Lieutenant General [[Walton H. Walker]] took command in September 1948, and he tried to re-invigorate the Army's training, but he was largely unsuccessful. This situation was to have serious consequences in South Korea.\n\n===Korean War===\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, [[Korea]] was divided into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] with North Korea (assisted by the [[Soviet Union]]),<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/korean-war-begins This Day in History], 1950, Korean War Begins</ref> becoming a [[communism|communist]] government after 1946, known as the [[People's Republic|Democratic People's Republic]], followed by South Korea becoming the [[Republic of Korea]].<ref name=\"National Archives\">[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/korean-conflict National Archives], ''US Enters the Korean Conflict''</ref> [[China]] became the communist People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1950, the Soviet Union backed North Korea while the United States backed South Korea, and China allied with the Soviet Union in what was to become the first military action of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault], Korean War</ref>\n\n[[File:Warkorea American Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fighting with the 2nd Inf. Div. north of the Chongchon River, SFC Major Cleveland, weapons squad leader, points out Communist-led North Korean position to his machine gun crew, 20 November 1950, PFC James Cox.]]\n\nThe peace of occupied Japan was shattered in June 1950 when 75,000 [[North Korean People's Army|North Korean]] troops with [[Soviet Union|Russian]] made tanks invaded South Korea, igniting the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault] Korean War</ref> U.S. naval and air forces quickly became involved in combat operations, and it was soon clear that U.S. ground forces would have to be committed. To stem the North Korean advance, the occupation forces in Japan were thus shipped off to South Korea as quickly as possible, but their lack of training and equipment was telling, as some of the initial U.S. units were destroyed by the North Koreans. However, the stage was eventually reached as enough units of Eighth Army arrived in Korea to make a firm front. The North Koreans threw themselves against that front, the [[Pusan Perimeter]], and failed to break it. {{quote|Eighth Army arrived in July 1950 and never left. \u2014Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Vandal, CG, Eighth Army, 29 August 2017<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/193076/the_national_defense_committee_visits_eighth_army_hqs The National Defense Committee visits Eighth Army Headquarters (29 August 2017)]</ref>}} In the meantime, Eighth Army had reorganized, since it had too many divisions under its command for it to exercise effective control directly. The [[U.S. I Corps|I Corps]] and the [[U.S. IX Corps|IX Corps]] were reactivated in the United States and then shipped to Korea to assume command of Eighth Army's subordinate divisions.\n\nThe stalemate was broken by the [[Battle of Incheon|Inchon landings]] of the [[U.S. X Corps|X Corps]] (tenth corps, consisting of soldiers and Marines). The North Korean forces, when confronted with this threat to their rear areas, combined with a breakout operation at Pusan, broke away and hastily retired north.\n\n[[File:General Walker and Lt. Gen William Dean.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lt. Gen. Walker (left) confers with Maj. Gen. [[William F. Dean]], Commander Ground Forces in Korea, on 7 July 1950]]\nBoth South and North Korea were almost entirely occupied by United Nations forces. However, once U.S. units neared the [[Yalu River]] and the frontier between North Korea and [[China]], the Chinese intervened and drastically changed the character of the war. Eighth Army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of the Chongchon River]] and forced to retreat all the way back to South Korea. U.S. historian [[Clay Blair]] noted that the Eighth Army was left completely unprotected on its right flank due to the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s retreat despite myths that arose about the Turks killing 200 enemies by bayonet. The defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any U.S. military unit in history. General Walker was killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950, and replaced by Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]]. The overstretched Eighth Army suffered heavily with the Chinese offensive, who were able to benefit from shorter lines of communication and with rather casually deployed enemy forces. The Chinese broke through the U.S. defenses despite U.S. [[air supremacy]] and the Eighth Army and U.N. forces retreated hastily to avoid encirclement. The Chinese offensive continued pressing U.S. forces, which lost [[Seoul]], the South Korean capital. Eighth Army's morale and ''esprit de corps'' hit rock bottom, to where it was widely regarded as a broken, defeated rabble.\n\nGeneral Ridgway forcefully restored Eighth Army to combat effectiveness over several months. Eighth Army slowed and ultimately halted the Chinese advance at the battles of [[Chipyong-ni]] and [[Wonju]]. It then counter-attacked the Chinese, re-took Seoul, and drove to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], where the front stabilized.\n\nWhen General Ridgway replaced [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] as the overall U.N. commander, Lieutenant General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of Eighth Army. After the war of movement during the first stages, the fighting in Korea settled down to a war of attrition. Ceasefire negotiations were begun at the village of [[Panmunjom]] in the summer of 1951, and they dragged on for two years. During the final combat operation of the war, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] (promoted to general 23 June 1953) commanded the Eighth Army. When the [[Military Demarcation Line]] was finally agreed to by the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]], South Korea and North Korea continued on as separate states.\n\n===Occupation of Korea===\n[[File:Eighth United States Army memorial (South Korea) 001.jpg|thumb|Eighth United States Army memorial at Yongsan]]\nDuring the [[aftermath of the Korean War]], the Eighth Army remained in South Korea. By the 1960s, I Corps, consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], remained as part of the Eighth Army. Then, in 1971, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, along with the command units of I Corps, which were moved across the Pacific Ocean to [[Fort Lewis]], [[State of Washington|Washington]].<ref>Don Oberdorfter, ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'', Addison-Wesley, 1997, p. 86.</ref> Later, in March 1977, a memo from President Jimmy Carter said \"...American forces will be withdrawn. Air cover will be continued.\" Bureaucratic resistance from the Executive Branch, with support in Congress, eventually saw the proposal watered down. Eventually one combat battalion and about 2,600 non-combat troops were withdrawn.<ref>Oberdorfer, The Two Koreas, 1997, 86-94.</ref>\n\nThis left the 2nd Infantry Division at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to assist the [[South Korean Army]]. Besides forming a trip-wire against another North Korean invasion, the 2nd Infantry Division remained there as the only Army unit in South Korea armed with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. (Otherwise, there is only the [[U.S. Air Force]] in South Korea and on [[Okinawa]].)  All nuclear weapons were taken from the Army to be under Air Force control. Later, all U.S. nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to move the 2nd Infantry Division southward. As of 2015, it appears that one brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division will remain at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]], near [[Dongducheon]].\n\nThe headquarters of the Eighth Army was [[Yongsan Garrison]], but moved southward to [[Camp Humphreys]] by 2019.<ref name=MoveGarrison/> In April 2017 the Eighth Army headquarters began its move from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys and held a ceremony to relocate a statue of General Walton Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/04/26/2017042601582.html|publisher=The Chosun Ilbo|title=8th U.S. Army Starts Moving Out of Seoul|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n[[File:Eighth US Army -

The Eighth Army took part in many of the [[amphibious landing]]s in the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], eventually participating in no less than sixty of them. The first mission of the Eighth Army, in September 1944, was to take over from the [[Sixth United States Army|U.S. Sixth Army]] in [[New Guinea]], [[New Britain]], the [[Admiralty Islands]] and on [[Morotai]], in order to free up the Sixth Army to engage in the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)]].\n\nThe Eighth Army again followed in the wake of the Sixth Army in December 1944, when it took over control of operations on [[Leyte Island]] on 26 December. In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on [[Luzon]], landing the [[XI Corps (United States)|XI Corps]] on 29 January near [[San Antonio, Zambales|San Antonio]] and the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] on the other side of [[Manila Bay]] two days later. Combining with [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] and [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped [[Manila]] in a great double-[[pincer movement]]. Eighth Army's final operation of the [[Pacific War]] was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]], including on the major island of [[Mindanao]], an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.\n\n===Occupation of Japan===\nEighth Army was to have participated in [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. It would have taken part in [[Operation Downfall#Coronet|Operation Coronet]], the second phase of the invasion, which would have seen the invasion of the [[Kant\u014d Plain]] on eastern [[Honsh\u016b]]. However, the Japanese surrender cancelled the invasion, and the Eighth Army found itself in charge of occupying it peacefully. [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation forces]] landed on 30 August 1945, with its headquarters in [[Yokohama]], then the HQ moved to the [[DN Tower 21|Dai-Ichi]] building in [[Tokyo]]. At the beginning of 1946, Eighth Army assumed responsibility for occupying all of Japan. Four quiet years then followed, during which the Eighth Army gradually deteriorated from a combat-ready fighting force into a somewhat soft, minimally-trained constabulary. Lieutenant General [[Walton H. Walker]] took command in September 1948, and he tried to re-invigorate the Army's training, but he was largely unsuccessful. This situation was to have serious consequences in South Korea.\n\n===Korean War===\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, [[Korea]] was divided into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] with North Korea (assisted by the [[Soviet Union]]),<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/korean-war-begins This Day in History], 1950, Korean War Begins</ref> becoming a [[communism|communist]] government after 1946, known as the [[People's Republic|Democratic People's Republic]], followed by South Korea becoming the [[Republic of Korea]].<ref name=\"National Archives\">[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/korean-conflict National Archives], ''US Enters the Korean Conflict''</ref> [[China]] became the communist People's Republic of China in 1949. In 1950, the Soviet Union backed North Korea while the United States backed South Korea, and China allied with the Soviet Union in what was to become the first military action of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault], Korean War</ref>\n\n[[File:Warkorea American Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fighting with the 2nd Inf. Div. north of the Chongchon River, SFC Major Cleveland, weapons squad leader, points out Communist-led North Korean position to his machine gun crew, 20 November 1950, PFC James Cox.]]\n\nThe peace of occupied Japan was shattered in June 1950 when 75,000 [[North Korean People's Army|North Korean]] troops with [[Soviet Union|Russian]] made tanks invaded South Korea, igniting the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"National Archives\"/><ref>[http://www.history.com/topics/korean-war History Vault] Korean War</ref> U.S. naval and air forces quickly became involved in combat operations, and it was soon clear that U.S. ground forces would have to be committed. To stem the North Korean advance, the occupation forces in Japan were thus shipped off to South Korea as quickly as possible, but their lack of training and equipment was telling, as some of the initial U.S. units were destroyed by the North Koreans. However, the stage was eventually reached as enough units of Eighth Army arrived in Korea to make a firm front. The North Koreans threw themselves against that front, the [[Pusan Perimeter]], and failed to break it. {{quote|Eighth Army arrived in July 1950 and never left. \u2014Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Vandal, CG, Eighth Army, 29 August 2017<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/193076/the_national_defense_committee_visits_eighth_army_hqs The National Defense Committee visits Eighth Army Headquarters (29 August 2017)]</ref>}} In the meantime, Eighth Army had reorganized, since it had too many divisions under its command for it to exercise effective control directly. The [[U.S. I Corps|I Corps]] and the [[U.S. IX Corps|IX Corps]] were reactivated in the United States and then shipped to Korea to assume command of Eighth Army's subordinate divisions.\n\nThe stalemate was broken by the [[Battle of Incheon|Inchon landings]] of the [[U.S. X Corps|X Corps]] (tenth corps, consisting of soldiers and Marines). The North Korean forces, when confronted with this threat to their rear areas, combined with a breakout operation at Pusan, broke away and hastily retired north.\n\n[[File:General Walker and Lt. Gen William Dean.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lt. Gen. Walker (left) confers with Maj. Gen. [[William F. Dean]], Commander Ground Forces in Korea, on 7 July 1950]]\nBoth South and North Korea were almost entirely occupied by United Nations forces. However, once U.S. units neared the [[Yalu River]] and the frontier between North Korea and [[China]], the Chinese intervened and drastically changed the character of the war. Eighth Army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of the Chongchon River]] and forced to retreat all the way back to South Korea. U.S. historian [[Clay Blair]] noted that the Eighth Army was left completely unprotected on its right flank due to the [[Turkish Brigade]]'s retreat despite myths that arose about the Turks killing 200 enemies by bayonet. The defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any U.S. military unit in history. General Walker was killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950, and replaced by Lieutenant General [[Matthew Ridgway]]. The overstretched Eighth Army suffered heavily with the Chinese offensive, who were able to benefit from shorter lines of communication and with rather casually deployed enemy forces. The Chinese broke through the U.S. defenses despite U.S. [[air supremacy]] and the Eighth Army and U.N. forces retreated hastily to avoid encirclement. The Chinese offensive continued pressing U.S. forces, which lost [[Seoul]], the South Korean capital. Eighth Army's morale and ''esprit de corps'' hit rock bottom, to where it was widely regarded as a broken, defeated rabble.\n\nGeneral Ridgway forcefully restored Eighth Army to combat effectiveness over several months. Eighth Army slowed and ultimately halted the Chinese advance at the battles of [[Chipyong-ni]] and [[Wonju]]. It then counter-attacked the Chinese, re-took Seoul, and drove to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], where the front stabilized.\n\nWhen General Ridgway replaced [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] as the overall U.N. commander, Lieutenant General [[James Van Fleet]] assumed command of Eighth Army. After the war of movement during the first stages, the fighting in Korea settled down to a war of attrition. Ceasefire negotiations were begun at the village of [[Panmunjom]] in the summer of 1951, and they dragged on for two years. During the final combat operation of the war, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] (promoted to general 23 June 1953) commanded the Eighth Army. When the [[Military Demarcation Line]] was finally agreed to by the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]], South Korea and North Korea continued on as separate states.\n\n===Occupation of Korea===\n[[File:Eighth United States Army memorial (South Korea) 001.jpg|thumb|Eighth United States Army memorial at Yongsan]]\nDuring the [[aftermath of the Korean War]], the Eighth Army remained in South Korea. By the 1960s, I Corps, consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] and the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], remained as part of the Eighth Army. Then, in 1971, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, along with the command units of I Corps, which were moved across the Pacific Ocean to [[Fort Lewis]], [[State of Washington|Washington]].<ref>Don Oberdorfter, ''The Two Koreas: A Contemporary History'', Addison-Wesley, 1997, p. 86.</ref> Later, in March 1977, a memo from President Jimmy Carter said \"...American forces will be withdrawn. Air cover will be continued.\" Bureaucratic resistance from the Executive Branch, with support in Congress, eventually saw the proposal watered down. Eventually one combat battalion and about 2,600 non-combat troops were withdrawn.<ref>Oberdorfer, The Two Koreas, 1997, 86-94.</ref>\n\nThis left the 2nd Infantry Division at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] to assist the [[South Korean Army]]. Besides forming a trip-wire against another North Korean invasion, the 2nd Infantry Division remained there as the only Army unit in South Korea armed with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. (Otherwise, there is only the [[U.S. Air Force]] in South Korea and on [[Okinawa]].)  All nuclear weapons were taken from the Army to be under Air Force control. Later, all U.S. nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to move the 2nd Infantry Division southward. As of 2015, it appears that one brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division will remain at [[Camp Casey, South Korea|Camp Casey]], near [[Dongducheon]].\n\nThe headquarters of the Eighth Army is [[Yongsan Garrison]], but it is scheduled to move southward to [[Camp Humphreys]] by 2019.<ref name=MoveGarrison/> In April 2017 the Eighth Army headquarters began its move from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys and held a ceremony to relocate a statue of General Walton Walker.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/04/26/2017042601582.html|publisher=The Chosun Ilbo|title=8th U.S. Army Starts Moving Out of Seoul|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current structure==\n[[File:Eighth US Army -

She achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her hit single \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\" and became one of the lead female artists during the [[British Invasion]] in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Hampstead]], [[London]], Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a [[Rolling Stones]] party, where she was discovered by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. After the release of her hit single \"As Tears Go By\", she became an international star. Her debut album ''[[Marianne Faithfull (album)|Marianne Faithfull]]'' (1965) (released simultaneously with her album ''[[Come My Way]]'') was a commercial success followed by a number of albums on [[Decca Records]]. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with [[Mick Jagger]]. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]'' (1967), ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' (1968), and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s. During that time she was [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], homeless, and a [[Opioid use disorder|heroin addict]].\n\nNoted for her distinctive voice, Faithfull's previously melodic and higher registered vocals (which were prevalent throughout her career in the 1960s) were affected by severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during the 1970s, permanently altering her voice, leaving it raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. This new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics for helping capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nAfter a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]].'' The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. ''Broken English'' earned Faithfull a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] and is often regarded as her \"definitive recording.\" She followed with a series of albums, including ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'' (1981), ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' (1983), and ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'' (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: ''[[Faithfull: An Autobiography]]'' (1994), ''Memories, Dreams & Reflections'' (2007), and ''Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record'' (2014).\n\nFaithfull is listed on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" list. She received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 [[Women's World Award]]s and was made a ''Commandeur'' of the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the government of France.\n\n==Early life and links to nobility==\nFaithfull was born in [[Hampstead]], London. Her half-brother is artist [[Simon Faithfull]]. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officer and professor of Italian Literature at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] of London University. Robert Glynn Faithfull's family lived in [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire, while he completed a doctorate at [[Liverpool University]].<ref name=\"BeatlesE\"/>\n\nFaithfull's mother, Eva, was the daughter of an [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian nobleman]], Artur Wolfgang, [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch (1875\u20131953). Eva chose to [[Courtesy style|style]] herself as [[Eva von Sacher-Masoch|Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whodoyouthinkyouaremagazine.com/episode/marianne-faithfull|title=Marianne Faithfull|work= Who Do You Think You Are?

Her parents divorced when she was six years old,<ref name=\"BeatlesE\"/> after which she moved with her mother to Milman Road in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Her primary school was in [[Brixton]].

During that time period, Faithfull started smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and became best friends with Pallenberg.

In an interview 27 years later with [[A.M.

To be a male [[drug addict]] and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\" In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to [[cocaine]], miscarried a daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while retreating to Jagger's country house in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/><ref name=\"Marianne Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/faithfull-marianne-biography |title=Marianne Biography |website=Enotes.com |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFaithfull's involvement in Jagger's life would be reflected in some of the Rolling Stones's best known songs. \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\", featured on the 1968 album ''[[Beggars Banquet]],'' was partially inspired by ''[[The Master and Margarita]],'' written by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], a book to which Faithfull introduced Jagger. The song \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]],\" on the 1969 album ''[[Let It Bleed]],'' was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[I Got the Blues]]\" on the 1971 album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' were also allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote \"[[Sister Morphine]]\". (The writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle; the resolution of the case has Faithfull listed as co-author of the song.) In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent did not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and battling with heroin addiction at the time. Faithfull appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' concert, giving a solo performance of \"Something Better\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nFaithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970, and she lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> Faithfull's personal life went into decline, and her career went into a tailspin. She made only a few appearances, including an [[The 1980 Floor Show|October 1973 performance]] for [[NBC]] with [[David Bowie]], singing [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nFaithfull lived on London's [[Soho]] streets for two years, suffering from [[heroin addiction]] and [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref>Sylvie Simmons [http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 interview], ''Mojo Magazine'', 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193903/http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 |date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Friends intervened and enrolled her in an [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] drug programme, from which she could get her daily fix on prescription from a chemist.<ref>{{cite web |author= Barber, Lynn |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,521920,00.html |title=You know, I'm not everybody's cup of tea! |work=The Observer |date=15 July 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> She failed at controlling or stabilising her [[drug addiction|addiction]] at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBUGo2YaJg |title=Marianne Faithfull Interview 1978|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> In 1971, producer [[Mike Leander]] found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]''. The album was shelved until 1985.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nSevere [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during this period, permanently altered Faithfull's voice, leaving it cracked and lower in pitch. While the new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics, journalist John Jones, of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', wrote that she had \"permanently vulgarised her voice\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In 1975 she released the [[country music|country]]-influenced record [[Dreamin' My Dreams (Marianne Faithfull album)|''Dreamin' My Dreams'']] (a.k.a. ''Faithless''), which reached No.1 on the [[Irish Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/> Faithfull moved into a [[squatting|squat]] without hot water or electricity in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] with then-boyfriend Ben Brierly, of the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[the Vibrators]]. She later shared flats in Chelsea and [[Regent's Park]] with [[Henrietta Moraes]].\n\nFaithfull's career returned full force in 1979 (the same year she was arrested for marijuana possession in [[Norway]]) with the album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]'', one of her most critically hailed albums.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> The album was partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year. In addition to the [[punk-pop]] sounds of the title track (which addressed terrorism in Europe, being dedicated to [[Ulrike Meinhof]]), the album also included \"Why D'Ya Do It?\", a punk-[[reggae]] song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by [[Heathcote Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Robert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1D61339F932A15753C1A967948260 |title=The Pop Life |work=The New York Times |date=21 October 1981 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> The musical structure of this song is complex; though on the surface hard rock, it is a [[Tango (dance)|tango]] in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by [[Barry Reynolds]] in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure are accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 is accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams' lyric was \"an early form of [[rap music|rap]]\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/> ''Broken English'' was also the album which revealed the full extent of Faithfull's drinking and drug use and its effect on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records being replaced by a raucous, deep voice which helped capture the raw emotions expressed in the album's songs.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nFaithfull began living in [[New York City|New York]] after the release of the follow-up to ''Broken English'', ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'', in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]'' (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed \"Ballad of the Soldier's Wife\" on [[Hal Willner]]'s tribute album ''[[Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill]]''. Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.\n\nIn 1985, she was at the [[Hazelden Foundation]] Clinic in [[Minnesota]] for rehabilitation. She then received treatment at [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]]. While living at a hotel in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a [[dual diagnosis]] ([[mental illness|mentally ill]] and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a ''\"thank you\"'' to Tose within the album package of ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]]'', on the back sleeve: \"To Howard Tose with love and thanks\". Faithfull's divorce from Brierly was also finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose's death in \"Flaming September\" from the album ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]''.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, this time as a jazz and blues singer, on ''Strange Weather'', also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\" for ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'', this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. \"I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song,\" she told [[Jay Cocks]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Faithfull declared, \"forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen.\"<ref name=\"Marianne Biography\"/> The album of covers was produced by [[Hal Willner]] after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of [[20th-century music]]. They chose to record such diverse tracks as [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]\" and \"[[Yesterdays (1933 song)|Yesterdays]]\", written by Broadway composers [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Otto Harbach]]. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Bessie Smith]]; [[Tom Waits]] wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhen [[Roger Waters]] assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]'' live in [[Berlin]] in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink's overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album ''Blazing Away,'' which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. ''Blazing Away'' was recorded at St. Ann's Cathedral in [[Brooklyn]]. The 13 selections include \"Sister Morphine\", a cover of [[Edith Piaf]]'s \"Les Prisons du Roy\", and \"Why D'Ya Do It?\" from ''Broken English''. Alanna Nash of ''Stereo Review'' commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her\u2014longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former [[The Band|Band]] member [[Garth Hudson]] and pianist [[Dr. John]]. Nash was also impressed with the album's autobiographical tone, noting \"Faithfull's gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who's been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has.\" The reviewer extolled Faithfull as \"one of the most challenging and artful of women artists,\" and ''Rolling Stone'' writer Fred Goodman asserted: \"''Blazing Away'' is a fine retrospective \u2013 proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa.\"<ref name=\"Marianne Biography\"/>\n\n''A Collection of Her Best Recordings'' was released in 1994 by [[Island Records]] to coincide with the release of the Faithfull autobiography; the two products originally shared the same cover art. It contained Faithfull's updated version of \"As Tears Go By\" from ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]],'' several cuts from ''Broken English'' and ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' and a song written by [[Patti Smith]] scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, \"[[Ghost Dance (song)|Ghost Dance]]\", suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old friends: Stones' drummer [[Charlie Watts]] and guitarist [[Ron Wood]] backed Faithfull's vocals on the song, while [[Keith Richards]] coproduced it. The retrospective album also featured one live track, \"Times Square\", from ''Blazing Away'' as well as a new Faithfull original, \"She\", penned with composer and arranger [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to be released the following year on ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]'', with additional songs co written with Badalamenti. Faithfull also sang \"Love is Teasin,\" an Irish folk standard, with [[The Chieftains]] on their album [[The Long Black Veil (album)|The Long Black Veil]], released in 1995. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the [[San Francisco]] band [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]]'s 1997 album Serenade in Red. Faithfull also sang interlude vocals on [[Metallica]]'s song \"[[The Memory Remains]]\" from their 1997 album ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]'' and appeared in the song's music video; the track reached No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart) and No.13 in the UK.\n\nAs her fascination with the music of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at the [[Gate Theatre]], [[Dublin]], playing [[Pirate Jenny]]. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, ''[[20th Century Blues (Marianne Faithfull album)|Twentieth Century Blues]]'' (1996), which focused on the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] as well as [[No\u00ebl Coward]], followed in 1998 by a recording of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (Marianne Faithfull album)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'', with the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour accompanied by [[Paul Trueblood]] at the piano, culminated in the filming, at the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]], of the DVD ''Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill''.\n\nIn 1998 Faithfull released ''A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology'', a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums ''Broken English'', ''Dangerous Acquaintances'', ''A Child's Adventure'', ''Strange Weather'', ''Blazing Away'', and ''A Secret Life'', as well as several [[B side]]s and unreleased tracks.\n\nFaithfull's 1999 DVD ''Dreaming My Dreams'' contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964 and interviews with the artist and several friends who have known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]] and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on [[PBS]] for the series ''[[Sessions at West 54th]]''. That same year, she ranked 25th in ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll''.\n\nRoger Waters (Pink Floyd) wrote the song ''Incarceration of a Flower Child'' in 1968; it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was eventually recorded by Marianne Faithfull on her 1999 album ''[[Vagabond Ways]]''.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Marianne-faithfull-8 Istanbul 2.jpg|thumb|right|Faithfull performing in 2008]]\nFaithfull released several albums in the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with ''[[Vagabond Ways]]'' (1999), which was produced and recorded by [[Mark Howard (producer)|Mark Howard]]. It included collaborations with [[Daniel Lanois]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, and writer (and friend) [[Frank McGuinness]]. Later that year she sang \"Love Got Lost\" on [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson's]] ''[[Night and Day II]]''.\n\nHer renaissance continued with ''[[Kissin Time]]'', released in 2002. The album contained songs written with [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Beck]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], David Courts and the [[France|French]] pop singer [[\u00c9tienne Daho]]. On this record, she paid tribute to [[Nico]] (with \"Song for Nico\"), whose work she admired. The album also included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called \"Sliding Through Life on Charm\".\n\nIn 2005, she released ''[[Before the Poison]]''. The album was primarily a collaboration with [[PJ Harvey]] and [[Nick Cave]], though [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jon Brion]] also contributed. ''Before the Poison'' received mixed reviews from both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walters, Barry |title=Before the poison -review |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 2005 |quote=The combination often proves too bleak.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Goldfein, Josh |title=Angel With Big Friends \u2013 ''Before the poison'' review |work=Village Voice |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-04-12/music/angel-with-big-friends/ |date=12 April 2005 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |quote=Faithfull's voice is just too weak to carry a tune without a narrative crutch...

In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter, [[Patrick Wolf]] on the duet \"Magpie\" from his third album ''The Magic Position'' and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film ''Truands'' called \"A Lean and Hungry Look\" with Ulysse.\n\nIn March 2007 she returned to the stage with a touring show entitled ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''. Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before including \"Something Better\", the song she sang on ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. The show also included the [[Harry Nilsson]] song \"Don't Forget Me\", \"Marathon Kiss\" from [[Vagabond Ways]] and a version of the traditional \"Spike Driver Blues\".\n\nArticles published at that time hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement and was hoping that money from ''Songs of the Innocence and Experience'' would enable her to live in comfort. She said: \"I'm not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I\u2019m going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don\u2019t have to work.

She achieved popularity in the 1960s with the release of her hit single \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\" and became one of the lead female artists during the [[British Invasion]] in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Hampstead]], [[London]], Faithfull began her career in 1964 after attending a [[Rolling Stones]] party, where she was discovered by [[Andrew Loog Oldham]]. After the release of her hit single \"As Tears Go By\", she became an international star. Her debut album ''[[Marianne Faithfull (album)|Marianne Faithfull]]'' (1965) (released simultaneously with her album ''[[Come My Way]]'') was a commercial success followed by a number of albums on [[Decca Records]]. From 1966 to 1970, she had a highly publicised romantic relationship with [[Mick Jagger]]. Her popularity was further enhanced by her film roles, such as ''[[I'll Never Forget What's'isname]]'' (1967), ''[[The Girl on a Motorcycle]]'' (1968), and ''[[Hamlet (1969 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1969). However, her popularity was overshadowed by personal problems in the 1970s. During that time she was [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], homeless, and a [[Opioid use disorder|heroin addict]].\n\nNoted for her distinctive voice, Faithfull's previously melodic and higher registered vocals (which were prevalent throughout her career in the 1960s) were affected by severe [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during the 1970s, permanently altering her voice, leaving it raspy, cracked and lower in pitch. This new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics for helping capture the raw emotions expressed in her music.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nAfter a long commercial absence, Faithfull made a comeback with the 1979 release of her critically acclaimed album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]].'' The album was a commercial success and marked a resurgence of her musical career. ''Broken English'' earned Faithfull a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] and is often regarded as her \"definitive recording.\" She followed with a series of albums, including ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'' (1981), ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' (1983), and ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'' (1987). Faithfull also wrote three books about her life: ''[[Faithfull: An Autobiography]]'' (1994), ''Memories, Dreams & Reflections'' (2007), and ''Marianne Faithfull: A Life on Record'' (2014).\n\nFaithfull is listed on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" list. She received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 [[Women's World Award]]s and was made a ''Commandeur'' of the ''[[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]'' by the government of France.\n\n==Early life and links to nobility==\nFaithfull was born in [[Hampstead]], London. Her half-brother is artist [[Simon Faithfull]]. Her father, Major Robert Glynn Faithfull, was a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] officer and professor of Italian Literature at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]] of London University. Robert Glynn Faithfull's family lived in [[Ormskirk]], Lancashire, while he completed a doctorate at [[Liverpool University]].<ref name=\"BeatlesE\"/>\n\nFaithfull's mother, Eva, was the daughter of an [[Austrian nobility|Austro-Hungarian nobleman]], Artur Wolfgang, [[Ritter]] von Sacher-Masoch (1875\u20131953).

During that time period, Faithfull started smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and became best friends with Pallenberg. She also began a much publicised relationship with Mick Jagger that same year. The couple became notorious and largely part of the hip [[Swinging London]] scene.

In an interview 27 years later with [[A.M. Homes]] for [[Details magazine|''Details'']], Faithfull discussed her wilder days and admitted that the drug bust fur rug incident had ravaged her personal life: \"It destroyed me. To be a male [[drug addict]] and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising. A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\" In 1968, Faithfull, by now addicted to [[cocaine]], miscarried a daughter (whom she had named Corrina) while retreating to Jagger's country house in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/><ref name=\"Marianne Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/faithfull-marianne-biography |title=Marianne Biography |website=Enotes.com |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nFaithfull's involvement in Jagger's life would be reflected in some of the Rolling Stones's best known songs. \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\", featured on the 1968 album ''[[Beggars Banquet]],'' was partially inspired by ''[[The Master and Margarita]],'' written by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], a book to which Faithfull introduced Jagger. The song \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]],\" on the 1969 album ''[[Let It Bleed]],'' was supposedly written and composed about Faithfull; the songs \"[[Wild Horses (The Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and \"[[I Got the Blues]]\" on the 1971 album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' were also allegedly influenced by Faithfull, and she co-wrote \"[[Sister Morphine]]\". (The writing credit for the song was the subject of a protracted legal battle; the resolution of the case has Faithfull listed as co-author of the song.) In her autobiography, Faithfull said Jagger and Richards released it in their own names so that her agent did not collect all the royalties and proceeds from the song, especially as she was homeless and battling with heroin addiction at the time. Faithfull appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' concert, giving a solo performance of \"Something Better\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nFaithfull ended her relationship with Jagger in May 1970, and she lost custody of her son in that same year, which led to her attempting suicide.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> Faithfull's personal life went into decline, and her career went into a tailspin. She made only a few appearances, including an [[The 1980 Floor Show|October 1973 performance]] for [[NBC]] with [[David Bowie]], singing [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nFaithfull lived on London's [[Soho]] streets for two years, suffering from [[heroin addiction]] and [[anorexia nervosa]].<ref>Sylvie Simmons [http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 interview], ''Mojo Magazine'', 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193903/http://www.anti.com/news.php?id=97 |date=30 September 2007}}</ref> Friends intervened and enrolled her in an [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] drug programme, from which she could get her daily fix on prescription from a chemist.<ref>{{cite web |author= Barber, Lynn |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,521920,00.html |title=You know, I'm not everybody's cup of tea! |work=The Observer |date=15 July 2001 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> She failed at controlling or stabilising her [[drug addiction|addiction]] at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZBUGo2YaJg |title=Marianne Faithfull Interview 1978|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref> In 1971, producer [[Mike Leander]] found her on the streets and made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]''. The album was shelved until 1985.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nSevere [[laryngitis]], coupled with persistent drug abuse during this period, permanently altered Faithfull's voice, leaving it cracked and lower in pitch. While the new sound was praised as \"whisky soaked\" by some critics, journalist John Jones, of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', wrote that she had \"permanently vulgarised her voice\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In 1975 she released the [[country music|country]]-influenced record [[Dreamin' My Dreams (Marianne Faithfull album)|''Dreamin' My Dreams'']] (a.k.a. ''Faithless''), which reached No.1 on the [[Irish Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"autobio\"/> Faithfull moved into a [[squatting|squat]] without hot water or electricity in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] with then-boyfriend Ben Brierly, of the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[the Vibrators]]. She later shared flats in Chelsea and [[Regent's Park]] with [[Henrietta Moraes]].\n\nFaithfull's career returned full force in 1979 (the same year she was arrested for marijuana possession in [[Norway]]) with the album ''[[Broken English (album)|Broken English]]'', one of her most critically hailed albums.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> The album was partially influenced by the punk explosion and her marriage to Brierly in the same year. In addition to the [[punk-pop]] sounds of the title track (which addressed terrorism in Europe, being dedicated to [[Ulrike Meinhof]]), the album also included \"Why D'Ya Do It?\", a punk-[[reggae]] song with aggressive lyrics adapted from a poem by [[Heathcote Williams]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Robert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1D61339F932A15753C1A967948260 |title=The Pop Life |work=The New York Times |date=21 October 1981 |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> The musical structure of this song is complex; though on the surface hard rock, it is a [[Tango (dance)|tango]] in 4/4 time, with an opening electric guitar riff by [[Barry Reynolds]] in which beats 1 and 4 of each measure are accented on the up-beat, and beat 3 is accented on the down beat. Faithfull, in her autobiography, commented that her fluid yet rhythmic reading of Williams' lyric was \"an early form of [[rap music|rap]]\".<ref name=\"autobio\"/> ''Broken English'' was also the album which revealed the full extent of Faithfull's drinking and drug use and its effect on her singing voice, with the melodic vocals on her early records being replaced by a raucous, deep voice which helped capture the raw emotions expressed in the album's songs.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1980s ===\nFaithfull began living in [[New York City|New York]] after the release of the follow-up to ''Broken English'', ''[[Dangerous Acquaintances]]'', in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. ''[[Rich Kid Blues]]'' (1985) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed \"Ballad of the Soldier's Wife\" on [[Hal Willner]]'s tribute album ''[[Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill]]''. Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.\n\nIn 1985, she was at the [[Hazelden Foundation]] Clinic in [[Minnesota]] for rehabilitation. She then received treatment at [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]]. While living at a hotel in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Faithfull started an affair (while still married to Brierly) with a [[dual diagnosis]] ([[mental illness|mentally ill]] and drug dependent) man, Howard Tose, who later committed suicide by jumping from a 14th floor window of the flat they shared.<ref name=\"autobio\"/> In 1987, Faithfull dedicated a ''\"thank you\"'' to Tose within the album package of ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]]'', on the back sleeve: \"To Howard Tose with love and thanks\". Faithfull's divorce from Brierly was also finalised that year. In 1995, she wrote and sang about Tose's death in \"Flaming September\" from the album ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]''.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Faithfull again reinvented herself, this time as a jazz and blues singer, on ''Strange Weather'', also produced by Willner. The album became her most critically lauded album of the decade. Coming full circle, the renewed Faithfull cut another recording of \"[[As Tears Go By (song)|As Tears Go By]]\" for ''[[Strange Weather (Marianne Faithfull album)|Strange Weather]]'', this time in a tighter, more gravelly voice. The singer confessed to a lingering irritation with her first hit. \"I always childishly thought that was where my problems started, with that damn song,\" she told [[Jay Cocks]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but she came to terms with it as well as with her past. In a 1987 interview with Rory O'Connor of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', Faithfull declared, \"forty is the age to sing it, not seventeen.\"<ref name=\"Marianne Biography\"/> The album of covers was produced by [[Hal Willner]] after the two had spent numerous weekends listening to hundreds of songs from the annals of [[20th-century music]]. They chose to record such diverse tracks as [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]\" and \"[[Yesterdays (1933 song)|Yesterdays]]\", written by Broadway composers [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Otto Harbach]]. The work also includes tunes first made notable by such blues luminaries as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Bessie Smith]]; [[Tom Waits]] wrote the title track. In 1988, Faithfull married writer and actor Giorgio Della Terza, but they divorced in 1991.<ref name=\"autobio\"/>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nWhen [[Roger Waters]] assembled an all-star cast of musicians to perform the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]'' live in [[Berlin]] in July 1990, Faithfull played the part of Pink's overprotective mother. Her musical career rebounded for the third time during the early 1990s with the live album ''Blazing Away,'' which featured Faithfull revisiting songs she had performed over the course of her career. ''Blazing Away'' was recorded at St. Ann's Cathedral in [[Brooklyn]]. The 13 selections include \"Sister Morphine\", a cover of [[Edith Piaf]]'s \"Les Prisons du Roy\", and \"Why D'Ya Do It?\" from ''Broken English''. Alanna Nash of ''Stereo Review'' commended the musicians whom Faithfull had chosen to back her\u2014longtime guitarist Reynolds was joined by former [[The Band|Band]] member [[Garth Hudson]] and pianist [[Dr. John]]. Nash was also impressed with the album's autobiographical tone, noting \"Faithfull's gritty alto is a cracked and halting rasp, the voice of a woman who's been to hell and back on the excursion fare which, of course, she has.\" The reviewer extolled Faithfull as \"one of the most challenging and artful of women artists,\" and ''Rolling Stone'' writer Fred Goodman asserted: \"''Blazing Away'' is a fine retrospective \u2013 proof that we can still expect great things from this greying, jaded contessa.\"<ref name=\"Marianne Biography\"/>\n\n''A Collection of Her Best Recordings'' was released in 1994 by [[Island Records]] to coincide with the release of the Faithfull autobiography; the two products originally shared the same cover art. It contained Faithfull's updated version of \"As Tears Go By\" from ''[[Strange Weather (1987 album)|Strange Weather]],'' several cuts from ''Broken English'' and ''[[A Child's Adventure]]'' and a song written by [[Patti Smith]] scheduled for inclusion on an Irish AIDS benefit album. This track, \"[[Ghost Dance (song)|Ghost Dance]]\", suggested to Faithfull by a friend who later died of AIDS, was made with a trio of old friends: Stones' drummer [[Charlie Watts]] and guitarist [[Ron Wood]] backed Faithfull's vocals on the song, while [[Keith Richards]] coproduced it. The retrospective album also featured one live track, \"Times Square\", from ''Blazing Away'' as well as a new Faithfull original, \"She\", penned with composer and arranger [[Angelo Badalamenti]] to be released the following year on ''[[A Secret Life (Marianne Faithfull album)|A Secret Life]]'', with additional songs co written with Badalamenti. Faithfull also sang \"Love is Teasin,\" an Irish folk standard, with [[The Chieftains]] on their album [[The Long Black Veil (album)|The Long Black Veil]], released in 1995. Faithfull sang a duet and recited text on the [[San Francisco]] band [[Oxbow (band)|Oxbow]]'s 1997 album Serenade in Red. Faithfull also sang interlude vocals on [[Metallica]]'s song \"[[The Memory Remains]]\" from their 1997 album ''[[Reload (Metallica album)|Reload]]'' and appeared in the song's music video; the track reached No. 28 in the U.S. (No.3 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart) and No.13 in the UK.\n\nAs her fascination with the music of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era Germany continued, Faithfull performed in ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at the [[Gate Theatre]], [[Dublin]], playing [[Pirate Jenny]]. Her interpretation of the music led to a new album, ''[[20th Century Blues (Marianne Faithfull album)|Twentieth Century Blues]]'' (1996), which focused on the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] as well as [[No\u00ebl Coward]], followed in 1998 by a recording of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins (Marianne Faithfull album)|The Seven Deadly Sins]]'', with the [[Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]]. A hugely successful concert and cabaret tour accompanied by [[Paul Trueblood]] at the piano, culminated in the filming, at the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]], of the DVD ''Marianne Faithfull Sings Kurt Weill''.\n\nIn 1998 Faithfull released ''A Perfect Stranger: The Island Anthology'', a two-disc compilation that chronicled her years with Island Records. It featured tracks from her albums ''Broken English'', ''Dangerous Acquaintances'', ''A Child's Adventure'', ''Strange Weather'', ''Blazing Away'', and ''A Secret Life'', as well as several [[B side]]s and unreleased tracks.\n\nFaithfull's 1999 DVD ''Dreaming My Dreams'' contained material about her childhood and parents, with historical video footage going back to 1964 and interviews with the artist and several friends who have known her since childhood. The documentary included sections on her relationship with [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]] and Mick Jagger, and brief interviews with Keith Richards. It concluded with footage from a 30-minute live concert, originally broadcast on [[PBS]] for the series ''[[Sessions at West 54th]]''. That same year, she ranked 25th in ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll''.\n\nRoger Waters (Pink Floyd) wrote the song ''Incarceration of a Flower Child'' in 1968; it was never recorded by Pink Floyd. The song was eventually recorded by Marianne Faithfull on her 1999 album ''[[Vagabond Ways]]''.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Marianne-faithfull-8 Istanbul 2.jpg|thumb|right|Faithfull performing in 2008]]\nFaithfull released several albums in the 2000s that received positive critical response, beginning with ''[[Vagabond Ways]]'' (1999), which was produced and recorded by [[Mark Howard (producer)|Mark Howard]]. It included collaborations with [[Daniel Lanois]], [[Emmylou Harris]], Pink Floyd's Roger Waters, and writer (and friend) [[Frank McGuinness]]. Later that year she sang \"Love Got Lost\" on [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson's]] ''[[Night and Day II]]''.\n\nHer renaissance continued with ''[[Kissin Time]]'', released in 2002. The album contained songs written with [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Beck]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], David Courts and the [[France|French]] pop singer [[\u00c9tienne Daho]]. On this record, she paid tribute to [[Nico]] (with \"Song for Nico\"), whose work she admired. The album also included an autobiographical song she co-wrote with Cocker, called \"Sliding Through Life on Charm\".\n\nIn 2005, she released ''[[Before the Poison]]''. The album was primarily a collaboration with [[PJ Harvey]] and [[Nick Cave]], though [[Damon Albarn]] and [[Jon Brion]] also contributed. ''Before the Poison'' received mixed reviews from both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Village Voice]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walters, Barry |title=Before the poison -review |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 2005 |quote=The combination often proves too bleak.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Goldfein, Josh |title=Angel With Big Friends \u2013 ''Before the poison'' review |work=Village Voice |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-04-12/music/angel-with-big-friends/ |date=12 April 2005 |accessdate=12 January 2012 |quote=Faithfull's voice is just too weak to carry a tune without a narrative crutch...

In 2007, Faithfull collaborated with the British singer-songwriter, [[Patrick Wolf]] on the duet \"Magpie\" from his third album ''The Magic Position'' and wrote and recorded a new song for the French film ''Truands'' called \"A Lean and Hungry Look\" with Ulysse.\n\nIn March 2007 she returned to the stage with a touring show entitled ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''. Supported by a trio, the performance had a semi-acoustic feel and toured European theatres throughout the spring and summer. The show featured many songs she had not performed live before including \"Something Better\", the song she sang on ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]''. The show also included the [[Harry Nilsson]] song \"Don't Forget Me\", \"Marathon Kiss\" from [[Vagabond Ways]] and a version of the traditional \"Spike Driver Blues\".\n\nArticles published at that time hinted Faithfull was looking to retirement and was hoping that money from ''Songs of the Innocence and Experience'' would enable her to live in comfort. She said: \"I'm not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I\u2019m going to have to get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, which means I have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don\u2019t have to work.

They compete in the [[Mid-American Conference]] for most sports.\n\n==History==\n[[File:EastCampus1915.jpg|thumb|left|Western State Normal School, 1915]]On May 27, 1903, Michigan Governor [[Aaron T.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally-located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex is directly next to Miller Auditorium, and features three performance stages and faculty offices. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903. It contains many of the university's historical buildings including, East Hall, West Hall, North Hall, Walwood Hall, Spindler Hall, Vandercook Hall, and The Little Theater. Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and several other academic and administrative offices.\n\nIn December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center. It also announced plans to demolish several of the university's original historic buildings and utilize the hilltop as green space.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ursula Zerilli |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/12/east_hall_to_undergo_15_millio.html |title=WMU's East Hall to undergo renovation for alumni center; 3 surrounding historic buildings to be demolished |publisher=MLive.com |date=December 10, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2013|December}}, both West Hall and the Speech and Hearing building that were on East Campus had been demolished.

The organization sponsors concerts, comedians, special events, and \"Miller Movies,\" presented at the school's main theater, Miller Auditorium. CAB sponsors both Bronco Bash and WMU's student Homecoming activities, in addition to many registered student organization events and activities.\n\nThere are also many concerts available to the public through WMU's College of Fine Arts.

WMU also has around 400 student organizations registered through the university that are available to any student.\n\n=== Student activism ===\nPlacement of the Chemistry Building generated much controversy from student groups because it displaced a large portion of greenery in the center of West Campus. A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michigan Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/news-25/1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |title=Michigan |publisher=Mlive.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222041300/http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-25%2F1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Fraternities and sororities ===\nSome of the fraternities established on campus include [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Alpha Eta Rho]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Omega Delta Epsilon]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Chi Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Omega Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] .\n\nSome of the sororities established on WMU's campus are, [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Xi Nu]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]] and [[Zeta Phi Beta]].\n\n=== Health services ===\nWestern Michigan University students and faculty are served by Sindecuse Health Center.

Kalamazoo was chosen as the new school's location on August 28, 1903.  Other locations considered included [[Allegan, Michigan|Allegan]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Decatur, Michigan|Decatur]], [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], and [[Hastings, Michigan|Hastings]].  The first building, then known as the Administration Building, and now known as East Hall, was constructed in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/1903/1903CampusDesign.htm |title=1903 Campus Plan &#124; Campus Planning &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University was first officially known as '''Western State Normal School''', and originally offered a two-year training program.  The first principal and president was [[Dwight B. Waldo]], who served from 1904 until 1936.  The school was renamed several times throughout its early history, beginning with '''Western State Teachers College''' in 1927, '''Michigan College of Education''' in 1941, and '''Western Michigan College''' in 1955. On February 26, 1957, Governor [[G. Mennen Williams]] signed a bill into law that made Western Michigan College the state's fourth public university and gave the school its current name of '''Western Michigan University'''.\n\nMost of the oldest and original WMU buildings and \"classrooms\" are collectively known as [[East Campus (Western Michigan University)|East Campus]], directly East from the more central \"West Campus\".\n\nAccess to the East Campus site was an issue because of the steep grade elevating it above the city. The [[Western State Normal Railroad]] was established in 1907 to carry students and staff up and down the hill via a [[funicular]]. It operated until 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cf.wmich.edu/planning/WebSites/Specialties/TrolleyCommemoration.htm |title=Western Trolley Commemoration &#124; Photos Images Trivia &#124; Western Michigan University |publisher=Cf.wmich.edu |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nWMU's campuses encompass more than {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} and roughly 150 buildings.

Many of the [[residence halls]] are found scattered throughout West Campus, while other [[dormitories]] (affectionately referred to as \"The Valleys\") are adjacent to West Campus in Goldsworth Valley.\n\nThe Bernhard Center is a centrally-located multi-purpose student union that provides student and community groups with meeting space. Located within the Bernhard Center is the Bronco Mall, a one-stop-shop for students which includes a large 24-hour computer lab, a [[food court]] featuring [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Biggby Coffee]], [[K-zoo Coney]], numerous tables and chairs for eating and socializing, a [[PNC Bank]], and one of two school [[bookstore]]s.  Waldo Library and the attached University Computing Center are on West Campus, as is the Dalton Musical Center. Recently constructed buildings on West Campus include the Western Heights [[dormitory]] and the Chemistry Building, which replaces aging McCracken Hall.\n\nWest Campus is also the site of [[Miller Auditorium]]. A large entertainment venue seating nearly 3500 people, it is Michigan's fourth largest auditorium. Miller Auditorium hosts events ranging from popular [[musicals]] and [[concerts]] to graduation commencements and film screenings. The Gilmore Theater Complex is directly next to Miller Auditorium, and features three performance stages and faculty offices. The [[Richmond Center for Visual Arts]] was added to the Fine Arts Complex in 2007, followed by South Kohrman Hall being renovated into the Kohrman Hall Studios in 2008. Both buildings house the [[Gwen Frostic]] School of Art.\n\n===East Campus===\n{{Main|East Campus (Western Michigan University)}}\n\nEast Campus is the original development dating from the university's founding in 1903.

Many of these buildings are on a hill overlooking the city of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. Walwood Hall, renovated in 1992, is home to the Graduate College, the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Medieval Institute, the WMU Office of Research and several other academic and administrative offices.\n\nIn December 2012, WMU announced plans to renovate its birthplace, historic East Hall, for use as an alumni center. It also announced plans to demolish several of the university's original historic buildings and utilize the hilltop as green space.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ursula Zerilli |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/12/east_hall_to_undergo_15_millio.html |title=WMU's East Hall to undergo renovation for alumni center; 3 surrounding historic buildings to be demolished |publisher=MLive.com |date=December 10, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2013|December}}, both West Hall and the Speech and Hearing building that were on East Campus had been demolished.

A temporary outdoor plaza was constructed outside of Sangren Hall in 2007 to replace the greenery. However, this also generated controversy and protests among students and faculty because of its aesthetic characteristics and costs. One such protest by a student group involved requesting the financial records of the construction and using chalk to depict the costs of each item on the plaza.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michigan Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/news-25/1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |title=Michigan |publisher=Mlive.com |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222041300/http://www.mlive.com/news/kzgazette/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews-25%2F1190214082159280.xml&coll=7 |archive-date=February 22, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n=== Fraternities and sororities ===\nSome of the fraternities established on campus include [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Alpha Eta Rho]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Omega Delta Epsilon]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Chi Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], [[Phi Sigma Pi]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Omega Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] [[Sigma Lambda Beta]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Sigma Tau Gamma]] .\n\nSome of the sororities established on WMU's campus are, [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Delta Xi Nu]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Lambda Theta Alpha]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]] and [[Zeta Phi Beta]].\n\n=== Health services ===\nWestern Michigan University students and faculty are served by Sindecuse Health Center.

For the early tasks that humans wanted computers to accomplish, it was possible to create algorithms that enabled the machine to execute all the steps needed to solve the problem in hand. So on the computer's part, no learning was needed.  For certain advanced tasks,  facial recognition for example, it is not easy to create the needed algorithms, partly as it's not easy for humans to precisely define how we recognise faces.  Abundant face related data exists however. So far, compared to the difficulty in directly creating the required algorithms,  it's turned out in practice to be easier to assist computers to learn themselves how to recognise faces from available data. The discipline of machine learning develops various approaches for computers to learn to accomplish tasks for which no algorithm exists.<ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\">{{cite book\n | author = Ethem Alpaydin \n | title =Introduction to Machine Learning\n | year = 2020\n | edition = Fourth\n | pages = xix, 1-3, 13-18\n | publisher = [[MIT]]\n |ISBN = 0262043793\n }}</ref><ref name=\"elements\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning approaches ===\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\nEarly classifications for machine learning approaches sometimes divided them into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system.

In the early days of AI as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]], some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"[[neural network]]s\"; these were mostly [[perceptron]]s and [[ADALINE|other models]] that were later found to be reinventions of the [[generalized linear model]]s of statistics.<ref>{{cite citeseerx |last1=Sarle |first1=Warren |title=Neural Networks and statistical models |citeseerx=10.1.1.27.699 |year=1994}}</ref> [[Probability theory|Probabilistic]] reasoning was also employed, especially in automated [[medical diagnosis]].<ref name=\"aima\">{{cite AIMA|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|488}}\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the [[GOFAI|logical, knowledge-based approach]] caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|488}} By 1980, [[expert system]]s had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.<ref name=\"changing\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Langley | first1 = Pat| title = The changing science of machine learning | doi = 10.1007/s10994-011-5242-y | journal = [[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]]| volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 275\u2013279 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to [[inductive logic programming]], but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in [[pattern recognition]] and [[information retrieval]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|708\u2013710; 755}} Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and [[computer science]] around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"[[connectionism]]\", by researchers from other disciplines including [[John Hopfield|Hopfield]], [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and [[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]]. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of [[backpropagation]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nMachine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the [[symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic approaches]] it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"changing\" /> As of 2019, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a sub field of AI. Yet some practitioners, for example Dr Daniel Hulme, who both teaches AI and  runs a company operating in the field, argues that machine learning and AI are separate. <ref name=\"elements\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://course.elementsofai.com/\n|title= The Elements of AI\n|publisher= [[University of Helsinki]]\n|date = Dec 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/satalia-ceo-no-one-is-doing-ai-optimisation-can-change-that-3775689/\n|title= Satalia CEO Daniel Hulme has a plan to overcome the limitations of machine learning\n|publisher= [[Techworld]]\n|date = October 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\"/>\n\n=== Relation to data mining ===\nMachine learning and [[data mining]] often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on ''known'' properties learned from the training data, [[data mining]] focuses on the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of (previously) ''unknown'' properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [[knowledge discovery]] in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to ''reproduce known'' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously ''unknown'' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\n=== Relation to optimization ===\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&pg=PA403&dq=\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\n\n=== Relation to statistics ===\nMachine learning and [[statistics]] are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population [[Statistical inference|inferences]] from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danilo |last=Bzdok |first2=Naomi |last2=Altman |authorlink2=Naomi Altman |first3=Martin |last3=Krzywinski |title=Statistics versus Machine Learning |journal=[[Nature Methods]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=233\u2013234 |year=2018 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.4642 |pmid=30100822 |pmc=6082636 }}</ref> According to [[Michael I.

The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]]. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [[bias\u2013variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [[overfitting]] and generalization will be poorer.<ref name=\"alpaydin\">{{Cite book |author=Alpaydin, Ethem |title=Introduction to Machine Learning |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoma00alpa_0 |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |place=London |isbn=978-0-262-01243-0 |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]]. There are two kinds of [[time complexity]] results.

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.

Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some ''similarity metric'' and evaluated, for example, by ''internal compactness'', or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and ''separation'', the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on ''estimated density'' and ''graph connectivity''.\n\n==== Semi-supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Semi-supervised learning}}\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between [[unsupervised learning]] (without any labeled training data) and [[supervised learning]] (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.  \n\nIn [[Weak supervision|weakly supervised learning]], the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/ws_blog_post.html|title=Weak Supervision: The New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning|author1=Alex Ratner |author2=Stephen Bach |author3=Paroma Varma |author4=Chris |others= referencing work by many other members of Hazy Research|website=hazyresearch.github.io|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Reinforcement learning ====\n{{Main|Reinforcement learning}}\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how [[software agent]]s ought to take [[Action selection|actions]] in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as [[game theory]], [[control theory]], [[operations research]], [[information theory]], [[simulation-based optimization]], [[multi-agent system]]s, [[swarm intelligence]], [[statistics]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a [[Markov Decision Process]] (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use [[dynamic programming]] techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reinforcement learning and markov decision processes|author1=van Otterlo, M.|author2=Wiering, M.|journal=Reinforcement Learning |volume=12|pages=3\u201342 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27645-3_1|series=Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization|isbn=978-3-642-27644-6}}</ref> Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\n\n==== Self learning ==== \n\nSelf-learning as machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning  named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA). <ref>  Bozinovski, S. (1982). \"A self-learning system using secondary reinforcement\" . In Trappl, Robert (ed.).

The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. <ref>Bozinovski, Stevo (2014) \"Modeling mechanisms of cognition-emotion interaction in artificial neural networks, since 1981.\" Procedia Computer Science p. 255-263 </ref>\nThe self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning  routine: \n  In situation s perform action a;\n  Receive consequence situation s\u2019;\n  Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s\u2019);\n  Update crossbar memory  w\u2019(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s\u2019).\n\nIt is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the  behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. <ref> Bozinovski, S.

Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual [[feature engineering]], and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include [[artificial neural network]]s, [[multilayer perceptron]]s, and supervised [[dictionary learning]].

However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n\n==== Sparse dictionary learning ====\n{{Main|Sparse dictionary learning}}\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of [[basis function]]s, and is assumed to be a [[sparse matrix]].

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in [[image de-noising]]. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.<ref>Aharon, M, M Elad, and A Bruckstein. 2006. \"[http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation].\" Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on 54 (11): 4311\u20134322</ref>\n\n==== Anomaly detection ====\n{{Main|Anomaly detection}}\nIn [[data mining]], anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Zimek|first=Arthur|title=Outlier Detection|date=2017|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages=1\u20135|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|isbn=9781489979933|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich}}</ref> Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as [[bank fraud]], a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Paul | last=Dokas | first2=Levent |last2=Ertoz |first3=Vipin |last3=Kumar |first4=Aleksandar |last4=Lazarevic |first5=Jaideep |last5=Srivastava |first6=Pang-Ning |last6=Tan | title=Data mining for network intrusion detection | year=2002 | journal=Proceedings NSF Workshop on Next Generation Data Mining | url=http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~kolari1/Mining/ngdm/dokas.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.<ref name=\"ChandolaSurvey\">{{cite journal |last1=Chandola |first1=V. |last2=Banerjee |first2=A. |last3=Kumar |first3=V. |year=2009 |title=Anomaly detection: A survey|journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=1\u201358|doi=10.1145/1541880.1541882|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71d1ac92ad36b62a04f32ed75a10ad3259a7218d }}</ref> Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n\n====Robot learning====\nIn [[developmental robotics]], [[robot learning]] algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, [[Motor_coordination#Muscle_synergies|motor synergies]] and imitation.\n\n==== Association rules ====\n{{Main|Association rule learning}}{{See also|Inductive logic programming}}\nAssociation rule learning is a [[rule-based machine learning]] method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.

The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.

In addition to [[market basket analysis]], association rules are employed today in application areas including [[Web usage mining]], [[intrusion detection]], [[continuous production]], and [[bioinformatics]]. In contrast with [[sequence mining]], association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a [[genetic algorithm]], with a learning component, performing either [[supervised learning]], [[reinforcement learning]], or [[unsupervised learning]].

Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.\n\n==== Artificial neural networks ====\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}{{See also|Deep learning}}\n[[File:Colored neural network.svg|thumb|300px|An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in a [[brain]]. Here, each circular node represents an [[artificial neuron]] and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.]]\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal [[brain]]s. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[[artificial neuron]]s\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\n\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are [[computer vision]] and [[speech recognition]].<ref>Honglak Lee, Roger Grosse, Rajesh Ranganath, Andrew Y.

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [[decision making]]. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.\n\n==== Support vector machines ====\n{{Main|Support vector machines}}\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related [[supervised learning]] methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.<ref name=\"CorinnaCortes\">{{Cite journal |last1=Cortes |first1=Corinna |authorlink1=Corinna Cortes |last2=Vapnik |first2=Vladimir N. |year=1995 |title=Support-vector networks |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013297 |doi=10.1007/BF00994018 }}</ref>  An SVM training algorithm is a non-[[probabilistic classification|probabilistic]], [[binary classifier|binary]], [[linear classifier]], although methods such as [[Platt scaling]] exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [[kernel trick]], implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of linear regression on a data set.]]\n\n==== Regression analysis ====\n{{Main|Regression analysis}}\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space. \n\n==== Bayesian networks ====\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.]]\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [[graphical model]] that represents a set of [[random variables]] and their [[conditional independence]] with a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [[influence diagram]]s.\n\n==== Genetic algorithms ====\n{{Main|Genetic algorithm}}\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [[search algorithm]] and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique that mimics the process of [[natural selection]], using methods such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] and [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] to generate new [[Chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genotype]]s in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.\n\n==== Federated learning ====\n{{Main|Federated learning}}\nFederated learning is a new approach to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, [[Gboard]] uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html|title=Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data|website=Google AI Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThere are many applications for machine learning, including:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Precision agriculture|Agriculture]]\n* [[Computational anatomy|Anatomy]]\n* [[Adaptive website]]s\n* [[Affective computing]]\n* [[Banking]]\n* [[Bioinformatics]]\n* [[Brain\u2013machine interface]]s\n* [[Cheminformatics]]\n* [[Citizen science]]\n* [[Network simulation|Computer networks]]\n* [[Computer vision]]\n* [[Credit-card fraud]] detection\n* [[Data quality]]\n* [[DNA sequence]] classification\n* [[Computational economics|Economics]]\n* [[Financial market]] analysis <ref>Machine learning is  included in the [[Chartered_Financial_Analyst_(CFA)#Curriculum|CFA Curriculum]] (discussion is top down); see: [https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/study-session/2020-l2-ss3.ashx  Kathleen DeRose and Christophe Le Lanno (2020). \"Machine Learning\"].</ref>\n* [[General game playing]]\n* [[Handwriting recognition]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[Insurance]]\n* [[Internet fraud]] detection\n* [[Computational linguistics|Linguistics]]\n* [[Machine learning control]]\n* [[Machine perception]]\n* [[Machine translation]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Automated medical diagnosis|Medical diagnosis]]\n* [[Natural language processing]]\n* [[Natural language understanding]]\n* [[Online advertising]]\n* [[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]]\n* [[Recommender system]]s\n* [[Robot locomotion]]\n* [[Search engines]]\n* [[Sentiment analysis]]\n* [[Sequence mining]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n* [[Speech recognition]]\n* [[Structural health monitoring]]\n* [[Syntactic pattern recognition]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Automated theorem proving|Theorem proving]]\n* [[Time series|Time series forecasting]]\n* [[User behavior analytics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn 2006, the media-services provider [[Netflix]] held the first \"[[Netflix Prize]]\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.

In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]], which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kohavi|first1=Ron|title=A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection|journal=International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=1995|url=http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Kohavi-IJCAI-95.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report [[sensitivity and specificity]] meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [[False Positive Rate]] (FPR) as well as the [[False Negative Rate]] (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Si|first2=Kangping|title=The total operating characteristic to measure diagnostic ability for multiple thresholds| journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=28|issue=3|year=2014|pages=570\u2013583|doi=10.1080/13658816.2013.862623}}</ref>\n\n== Ethics ==\nMachine learning poses a host of [[Machine ethics|ethical questions]].

There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Char |first=D.

For the early tasks that humans wanted computers to accomplish, it was possible to create algorithms that enabled the machine to execute all the steps needed to solve the problem in hand. So on the computer's part, no learning was needed.  For certain advanced tasks,  facial recognition for example, it is not easy to create the needed algorithms, partly as it's not easy for humans to precisely define how we recognise faces.  Abundant face related data exists however. So far, compared to the difficulty in directly creating the required algorithms,  it's turned out in practice to be easier to assist computers to learn themselves how to recognise faces from available data. The discipline of machine learning develops various approaches for computers to learn to accomplish tasks for which no algorithm exists.<ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\">{{cite book\n | author = Ethem Alpaydin \n | title =Introduction to Machine Learning\n | year = 2020\n | edition = Fourth\n | pages = xix, 1-3, 13-18\n | publisher = [[MIT]]\n |ISBN = 0262043793\n }}</ref><ref name=\"elements\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning approaches ===\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\nEarly classifications for machine learning approaches sometimes divided them into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system. These were:\n<br/>[[Supervised learning]]:  The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] inputs to outputs.\n<br/>[[Unsupervised learning]]:  No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ([[feature learning]]).\n<br/>[[Reinforcement learning]]:  A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as [[Autonomous car|driving a vehicle]] or playing a game against an opponent As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. <ref name=\"bishop2006\"/>\n\nOther approaches or processes have since developed that don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

In the early days of AI as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]], some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"[[neural network]]s\"; these were mostly [[perceptron]]s and [[ADALINE|other models]] that were later found to be reinventions of the [[generalized linear model]]s of statistics.<ref>{{cite citeseerx |last1=Sarle |first1=Warren |title=Neural Networks and statistical models |citeseerx=10.1.1.27.699 |year=1994}}</ref> [[Probability theory|Probabilistic]] reasoning was also employed, especially in automated [[medical diagnosis]].<ref name=\"aima\">{{cite AIMA|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|488}}\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the [[GOFAI|logical, knowledge-based approach]] caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|488}} By 1980, [[expert system]]s had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.<ref name=\"changing\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Langley | first1 = Pat| title = The changing science of machine learning | doi = 10.1007/s10994-011-5242-y | journal = [[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]]| volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 275\u2013279 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to [[inductive logic programming]], but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in [[pattern recognition]] and [[information retrieval]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|708\u2013710; 755}} Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and [[computer science]] around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"[[connectionism]]\", by researchers from other disciplines including [[John Hopfield|Hopfield]], [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and [[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]]. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of [[backpropagation]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nMachine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the [[symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic approaches]] it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"changing\" /> As of 2019, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a sub field of AI. Yet some practitioners, for example Dr Daniel Hulme, who both teaches AI and  runs a company operating in the field, argues that machine learning and AI are separate. <ref name=\"elements\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://course.elementsofai.com/\n|title= The Elements of AI\n|publisher= [[University of Helsinki]]\n|date = Dec 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/satalia-ceo-no-one-is-doing-ai-optimisation-can-change-that-3775689/\n|title= Satalia CEO Daniel Hulme has a plan to overcome the limitations of machine learning\n|publisher= [[Techworld]]\n|date = October 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\"/>\n\n=== Relation to data mining ===\nMachine learning and [[data mining]] often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on ''known'' properties learned from the training data, [[data mining]] focuses on the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of (previously) ''unknown'' properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [[knowledge discovery]] in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to ''reproduce known'' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously ''unknown'' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\n=== Relation to optimization ===\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&pg=PA403&dq=\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\n\n=== Relation to statistics ===\nMachine learning and [[statistics]] are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population [[Statistical inference|inferences]] from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danilo |last=Bzdok |first2=Naomi |last2=Altman |authorlink2=Naomi Altman |first3=Martin |last3=Krzywinski |title=Statistics versus Machine Learning |journal=[[Nature Methods]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=233\u2013234 |year=2018 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.4642 |pmid=30100822 |pmc=6082636 }}</ref> According to [[Michael I.

The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]]. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [[bias\u2013variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [[overfitting]] and generalization will be poorer.<ref name=\"alpaydin\">{{Cite book |author=Alpaydin, Ethem |title=Introduction to Machine Learning |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoma00alpa_0 |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |place=London |isbn=978-0-262-01243-0 |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]]. There are two kinds of [[time complexity]] results. Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n\n== Approaches ==\n\n=== Types of learning algorithms ===\n\nThe types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.\n\n==== Supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Supervised learning}}\n[[File:Svm max sep hyperplane with margin.png|thumb|A [[support vector machine]] is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a [[linear classifier|linear boundary]].

Through iterative optimization of an [[Loss function|objective function]], supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mohri |first1=Mehryar |last2=Rostamizadeh |first2=Afshin |last3=Talwalkar |first3=Ameet |title=Foundations of Machine Learning |date=2012 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=9780262018258}}</ref> An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.

As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. \n\n[[Similarity learning]] is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in [[ranking]], [[recommendation systems]], visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.\n\n==== Unsupervised learning ====\n{{Main|Unsupervised learning}}{{See also|Cluster analysis}}\nUnsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of [[density estimation]] in [[statistics]], such as finding the [[probability density function]].<ref name=\"JordanBishop2004\">{{cite book |first1=Michael I. |last1=Jordan |first2=Christopher M. |last2=Bishop |chapter=Neural Networks |editor=Allen B.

Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some ''similarity metric'' and evaluated, for example, by ''internal compactness'', or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and ''separation'', the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on ''estimated density'' and ''graph connectivity''.\n\n==== Semi-supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Semi-supervised learning}}\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between [[unsupervised learning]] (without any labeled training data) and [[supervised learning]] (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.  \n\nIn [[Weak supervision|weakly supervised learning]], the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/ws_blog_post.html|title=Weak Supervision: The New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning|author1=Alex Ratner |author2=Stephen Bach |author3=Paroma Varma |author4=Chris |others= referencing work by many other members of Hazy Research|website=hazyresearch.github.io|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Reinforcement learning ====\n{{Main|Reinforcement learning}}\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how [[software agent]]s ought to take [[Action selection|actions]] in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the  behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. <ref> Bozinovski, S.

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in [[image de-noising]]. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.<ref>Aharon, M, M Elad, and A Bruckstein. 2006. \"[http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation].\" Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on 54 (11): 4311\u20134322</ref>\n\n==== Anomaly detection ====\n{{Main|Anomaly detection}}\nIn [[data mining]], anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Zimek|first=Arthur|title=Outlier Detection|date=2017|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages=1\u20135|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|isbn=9781489979933|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich}}</ref> Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as [[bank fraud]], a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data, unless it has been aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Paul | last=Dokas | first2=Levent |last2=Ertoz |first3=Vipin |last3=Kumar |first4=Aleksandar |last4=Lazarevic |first5=Jaideep |last5=Srivastava |first6=Pang-Ning |last6=Tan | title=Data mining for network intrusion detection | year=2002 | journal=Proceedings NSF Workshop on Next Generation Data Mining | url=http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~kolari1/Mining/ngdm/dokas.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.<ref name=\"ChandolaSurvey\">{{cite journal |last1=Chandola |first1=V. |last2=Banerjee |first2=A. |last3=Kumar |first3=V. |year=2009 |title=Anomaly detection: A survey|journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=1\u201358|doi=10.1145/1541880.1541882|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71d1ac92ad36b62a04f32ed75a10ad3259a7218d }}</ref> Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n\n====Robot learning====\nIn [[developmental robotics]], [[robot learning]] algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, [[Motor_coordination#Muscle_synergies|motor synergies]] and imitation.\n\n==== Association rules ====\n{{Main|Association rule learning}}{{See also|Inductive logic programming}}\nAssociation rule learning is a [[rule-based machine learning]] method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.

The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bassel|first=George W.|last2=Glaab|first2=Enrico|last3=Marquez|first3=Julietta|last4=Holdsworth|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bacardit|first5=Jaume|date=2011-09-01|title=Functional Network Construction in Arabidopsis Using Rule-Based Machine Learning on Large-Scale Data Sets|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=23|issue=9|pages=3101\u20133116|doi=10.1105/tpc.111.088153|issn=1532-298X|pmc=3203449|pmid=21896882}}</ref> Rule-based machine learning approaches include [[learning classifier system]]s, association rule learning, and [[artificial immune system]]s.\n\nBased on the concept of strong rules, [[Rakesh Agrawal (computer scientist)|Rakesh Agrawal]], [[Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski]] and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by [[point-of-sale]] (POS) systems in supermarkets.<ref name=\"mining\">{{Cite book | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = R. | last2 = Imieli\u0144ski | first2 = T. | last3 = Swami | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1145/170035.170072 | chapter = Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases | title = Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data - SIGMOD '93 | pages = 207 | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0897915922 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.40.6984 }}</ref> For example, the rule <math>\\{\\mathrm{onions, potatoes}\\} \\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm{burger}\\}</math> found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat.

In addition to [[market basket analysis]], association rules are employed today in application areas including [[Web usage mining]], [[intrusion detection]], [[continuous production]], and [[bioinformatics]]. In contrast with [[sequence mining]], association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a [[genetic algorithm]], with a learning component, performing either [[supervised learning]], [[reinforcement learning]], or [[unsupervised learning]]. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a [[piecewise]] manner in order to make predictions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Urbanowicz|first=Ryan J.|last2=Moore|first2=Jason H.|date=2009-09-22|title=Learning Classifier Systems: A Complete Introduction, Review, and Roadmap|journal=Journal of Artificial Evolution and Applications|language=en|volume=2009|pages=1\u201325|doi=10.1155/2009/736398|issn=1687-6229}}</ref>\n\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using [[logic programming]] as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that [[Entailment|entails]] all positive and no negative examples. [[Inductive programming]] is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as [[Functional programming|functional programs]].\n\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in [[bioinformatics]] and [[natural language processing]].

Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.\n\n==== Artificial neural networks ====\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}{{See also|Deep learning}}\n[[File:Colored neural network.svg|thumb|300px|An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in a [[brain]]. Here, each circular node represents an [[artificial neuron]] and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.]]\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal [[brain]]s. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[[artificial neuron]]s\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\n\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are [[computer vision]] and [[speech recognition]].<ref>Honglak Lee, Roger Grosse, Rajesh Ranganath, Andrew Y.

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [[decision making]]. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.\n\n==== Support vector machines ====\n{{Main|Support vector machines}}\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related [[supervised learning]] methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.<ref name=\"CorinnaCortes\">{{Cite journal |last1=Cortes |first1=Corinna |authorlink1=Corinna Cortes |last2=Vapnik |first2=Vladimir N. |year=1995 |title=Support-vector networks |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013297 |doi=10.1007/BF00994018 }}</ref>  An SVM training algorithm is a non-[[probabilistic classification|probabilistic]], [[binary classifier|binary]], [[linear classifier]], although methods such as [[Platt scaling]] exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [[kernel trick]], implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of linear regression on a data set.]]\n\n==== Regression analysis ====\n{{Main|Regression analysis}}\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space. \n\n==== Bayesian networks ====\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.]]\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [[graphical model]] that represents a set of [[random variables]] and their [[conditional independence]] with a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [[influence diagram]]s.\n\n==== Genetic algorithms ====\n{{Main|Genetic algorithm}}\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [[search algorithm]] and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique that mimics the process of [[natural selection]], using methods such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] and [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] to generate new [[Chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genotype]]s in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.\n\n==== Federated learning ====\n{{Main|Federated learning}}\nFederated learning is a new approach to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices.

In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]], which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kohavi|first1=Ron|title=A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection|journal=International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=1995|url=http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Kohavi-IJCAI-95.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report [[sensitivity and specificity]] meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [[False Positive Rate]] (FPR) as well as the [[False Negative Rate]] (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Si|first2=Kangping|title=The total operating characteristic to measure diagnostic ability for multiple thresholds| journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=28|issue=3|year=2014|pages=570\u2013583|doi=10.1080/13658816.2013.862623}}</ref>\n\n== Ethics ==\nMachine learning poses a host of [[Machine ethics|ethical questions]].

There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Char |first=D.

He wrote only one book that was not of this character.  It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I have not been able to get hold of a copy since.  I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmQUAAAAQAAJ&dq=outlines+of+character&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Outlines of character, the great character, the English character [&c.] by a member of the Philomathic institution|last=Outlines|date=1823|language=en}}</ref>}}\nHis family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Viscount Maugham]], did become a lawyer, enjoying a distinguished legal career and serving as [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1938 to 1939.\n\nMaugham's mother, Edith Mary (n\u00e9e Snell), contracted [[tuberculosis]], a condition for which her physician prescribed childbirth.{{sfn|Hastings|2010}} She had Maugham several years after the last of his three elder brothers was born. By the time Maugham was three, his older brothers were all away at boarding school.\n\nEdith's sixth and final son died on 25 January 1882, one day after his birth. It was Maugham's eighth birthday. Edith died of tuberculosis six days later on 31 January at the age of 41.<ref>Meyers, 2004, p. 11.</ref> The early death of his mother left Maugham traumatized. He kept his mother's photograph at his bedside for the rest of his life.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> Two years after Edith's death, Maugham's father died in France of cancer.\n\nMaugham was sent back to the UK to be cared for by his paternal uncle, Henry MacDonald Maugham, the Vicar of [[Whitstable]], in Kent. The move was damaging. Henry Maugham was cold and emotionally cruel.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The boy attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], which was also difficult for him. He was teased for his bad English (French had been his first language) and his short stature, which he inherited from his father. Maugham developed a [[Stuttering|stammer]] that stayed with him all his life. It was sporadic, being subject to his moods and circumstances.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 17.</ref> Miserable both at his uncle's vicarage and at school, the young Maugham developed a talent for making wounding remarks to those who displeased him. This ability is sometimes reflected in Maugham's literary characters.\n\nAt age 16, Maugham refused to continue at The King's School. His uncle allowed him to travel to Germany, where he studied literature, philosophy and German at [[Heidelberg University]]. During his year in Heidelberg, Maugham met and had a sexual affair with [[John Ellingham Brooks]], an Englishman ten years his senior.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 24.</ref> He also wrote his first book there, a biography of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], an [[opera]] composer.<ref>Epstein, 1991, p. 189.</ref>\n\nAfter Maugham's return to Britain, his uncle found him a position in an accountant's office. After a month Maugham gave it up and returned to Whitstable. His uncle tried to find Maugham a new profession. Maugham's father and three older brothers were distinguished lawyers; but Maugham was not interested in this profession. He rejected a career in the Church because of his stutter. His uncle rejected the Civil Service, believing that it was no longer a career for gentlemen after a new law requiring applicants to pass an entrance examination. The local physician suggested the medical profession and Maugham's uncle agreed.\n\nMaugham had been writing steadily since he was 15, and wanted to be an author, but he did not tell his guardian. For the next five years, he studied medicine at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]] in [[Lambeth]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:Maugham facing camera.jpg|thumb|upright|W. Somerset Maugham]]\nMaugham was living in the great city of London, meeting people of a \"low\" sort whom he would never have met otherwise, and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student: \"I saw how men died. I saw how they bore pain. I saw what hope looked like, fear and relief&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\">{{cite book|last=Maugham|first=Somerset|title=[[The Summing Up]]|year=1938|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London}}</ref>\n\nMaugham kept his own lodgings, took pleasure in furnishing them, filled many notebooks with literary ideas, and continued writing nightly while at the same time studying for his medical degree. In 1897, he published his first novel, ''[[Liza of Lambeth]]'', a tale of working-class adultery and its consequences. It drew its details from Maugham's experiences as a medical student doing [[midwifery]] work in [[Lambeth]], a South London slum. Maugham wrote near the opening of the novel: \"...&nbsp;it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of the story; the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue.\"<ref>Maugham, ''Liza of Lambeth'' (Rockville, MD: Serenity Publishers, 2008), p. 10.</ref>\n\n''Liza of Lambeth'''s first print run sold out in a matter of weeks. Maugham, who had qualified as a medic, dropped medicine and embarked on his 65-year career as a man of letters. He later said, \"I took to it as a duck takes to water.\"<ref>Maugham, ''The Partial View'' (Heineman 1954), p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe writer's life allowed Maugham to travel and to live in places such as Spain and [[Capri]] for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of ''Liza''. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play ''[[Lady Frederick]]''. By the next year, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards.\n\nMaugham's supernatural thriller, ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' (1908), based its principal character on the well-known and somewhat disreputable [[Aleister Crowley]]. Crowley took some offence at the treatment of the protagonist, Oliver Haddo. He wrote a critique of the novel, charging Maugham with plagiarism, in a review published in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Crowley's ''Vanity Fair'' review is reprinted in Anthony Curtis and John Whitehead, eds., ''W. Somerset Maugham The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge Kegan & Paul, 1987), pp. 44\u201356.</ref> Maugham survived the criticism without much damage to his reputation.\n\n===Popular success, 1914\u201339===\nBy 1914, Maugham was famous, with 10 plays produced and 10 novels published. Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out, he served in France as a member of the [[British Red Cross]]'s so-called \"[[List of ambulance drivers during World War I#Writers|Literary Ambulance Drivers]]\", a group of some 24 well-known writers, including the Americans [[John Dos Passos]], [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]].\n[[File:Maugham early career.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maugham early in his career]]\n\nDuring this time he met [[Gerald Haxton|Frederick Gerald Haxton]], a young [[San Francisco, California|San Franciscan]], who became his companion and lover until Haxton's death in 1944.<ref>Haxton appears as Tony Paxton in Maugham's 1917 play, ''Our Betters''.</ref> Throughout this period, Maugham continued to write. He proofread ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' at a location near [[Dunkirk]] during a lull in his ambulance duties.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 188.</ref>\n\n''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' (1915) initially was criticized in both England and the United States; the ''[[New York World]]'' described the romantic obsession of the protagonist Philip Carey as \"the sentimental servitude of a poor fool\". The influential American novelist and critic [[Theodore Dreiser]] rescued the novel, referring to it as a work of genius and comparing it to a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] symphony. His review gave the book a lift, and it has never been out of print since.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 197\u20138.</ref>\n\nMaugham indicates in his foreword that he derived the title from a passage in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics'':\n:\"The impotence of man to govern or restrain the emotions I call bondage, for a man who is under their control is not his own master&nbsp;... so that he is often forced to follow the worse, although he see the better before him.\"<ref>Ruth Franklin, \"The Great and the Good,\" ''The New Yorker'', 31 May 2010, retrieved 6 September 2012</ref>\n\n''Of Human Bondage'' is considered to have many autobiographical elements. Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot (rather than his stammer); the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable; and Carey is a medic. Maugham insisted the book was more invention than fact. The close relationship between fictional and non-fictional became Maugham's trademark. He wrote in 1938: \"Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now, looking back on it, I can hardly distinguish one from the other.\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nMaugham entered into a relationship with [[Gwendoline Maud Syrie Barnardo|Syrie Wellcome]], the wife of [[Henry Wellcome]], an American-born English pharmaceutical magnate. They had a daughter named [[Mary Elizabeth Maugham|Mary Elizabeth]] (1915\u20131998).<ref>(Her birth name is recorded as Mary Elizabeth Wellcome in the immigration and naturalization files of [[Ellis Island]], along with her mother, who is listed as Syrie Wellcome, on the 21 July 1916 manifest of HMS ''Baltic''.)</ref> Henry Wellcome sued his wife for divorce, naming Maugham as co-respondent.<ref name=\"wellcome\">{{cite web | title=Syrie and Mounteney Wellcome | author=Bailey, Penny | work=Wellcome Trust | url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/History/WTX052197.htm | accessdate=2013-11-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1917, following the ''[[decree absolute]]'', Syrie Wellcome and Maugham were married. Syrie Maugham became a noted interior decorator who in the 1920s popularized \"the all-white room\". They changed their daughter's surname, originally registered as Wellcome and reflecting Syrie's marriage. She was familiarly called Liza and her surname was changed to Maugham.\n\nThe marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated. Maugham later lived in the French Riviera with his partner Gerald Haxton until Haxton's death in 1944. He next lived with [[Alan Searle]] until his own death in 1965.{{sfn|Hastings|2010}}\n\n===Sexuality===\n\nMaugham has been described both as bisexual{{sfn|Hastings|2010|p=39}}{{sfn|Meyers|2010|p=86}}{{sfn|Klein|2014|p=142}}\nand as homosexual.<ref name=\"HumanBondageCalderIntro\">{{cite book | title = Of Human Bondage | last1 = Maugham | first1 = W.

Somerset Maugham, ''A Writer\u2019s Notebook'' (1949).</ref>\n\n==Intelligence work==\nMaugham returned to Britain from his ambulance unit duties in order to promote ''Of Human Bondage''. With that completed, he was eager to assist the war effort again. As he was unable to return to his ambulance unit, Syrie arranged for him to be introduced to a high-ranking intelligence officer known as \"R\"; he was recruited by [[John Wallinger]].<ref name=Popplewell230>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=230.}}</ref> In September 1915, Maugham began work in Switzerland, as one of the network of British agents who operated against the [[Berlin Committee]], whose members included [[Virendranath Chattopadhyay]], an Indian revolutionary trying to resist colonial Britain's rule of India. Maugham lived in Switzerland as a writer.\n\nIn June 1917, Maugham was asked by Sir [[William G. E. Wiseman|William Wiseman]], an officer of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (later named MI6), to undertake a special mission in Russia.<ref name=\"Popplewell230\"/><ref name = \"Morgan 1980 p227\">Morgan, 1980, p. 227.</ref> It was part of an attempt to keep the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] in power and Russia in the war by countering German pacifist propaganda.<ref name = \"Morgan 1980 p226\">Morgan, 1980, p. 226.</ref> Two and a half months later, the [[Bolsheviks]] took control. Maugham subsequently said that if he had been able to get there six months earlier, he might have succeeded. Quiet and observant, Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work; he believed he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgment and the ability to avoid being deceived by facile appearances.<ref name=\"Popplewell230\"/><ref name=Woods55>{{Harvnb|Woods|2007|p=55.}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nMaugham used his spying experiences as the basis for ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'', a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly, sophisticated, aloof spy. This character is considered to have influenced [[Ian Fleming]]'s later series of ''[[James Bond]]'' novels.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 206.</ref> In 1922, Maugham dedicated his book ''On A Chinese Screen'' to Syrie. This was a collection of 58 ultra-short story sketches, which he had written during his 1920 travels through China and Hong Kong, intending to expand the sketches later as a book.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 245, 264.</ref>\n\n==Travels and writing==\nIn 1916, Maugham travelled to the Pacific to research his novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', based on the life of [[Paul Gauguin]]. This was the first of his journeys through the late-Imperial world of the 1920s and 1930s that inspired his novels. He became known as a writer who portrayed the last days of European colonialism in India, Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific, although the books on which this reputation rests represent only a fraction of his output. On this and all subsequent journeys, he was accompanied by Haxton, whom he regarded as indispensable to his success as a writer. Maugham was painfully shy, and Haxton the extrovert gathered human material which the author drew from for his fiction.\n\nMaugham's play ''[[The Letter (play)|The Letter]]'', starring [[Gladys Cooper]], had its premiere in London in 1927. Later, he asked that [[Katharine Cornell]] play the lead in the 1927 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version. He had adapted it for the stage from a story published in 1924 in [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Hearst's International]]; it was reprinted in his collection ''[[The Casuarina Tree]]'' (1926). \n\nThe play was adapted as a film [[The Letter (1929 film)|by the same name]] in 1929. [[Jeanne Eagels]] had the lead. A second film adaptation was released [[The Letter (1940 film)|in 1940]], starring  American actress [[Bette Davis]], who was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress for her performance. In 1951, Katherine Cornell was a great success playing the lead in Maugham's comedy ''[[The Constant Wife]]''.<ref>Tad Mosel, ''Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell,'' Little, Brown & Co., Boston (1978)</ref>{{page needed|date=March  2020}}\n\nIn 1926, Maugham bought the [[Villa La Mauresque]], on 9 acres (3.6 hectares) at [[Cap Ferrat]] on the [[French Riviera]]. It was his home for most of the rest of his life. There he hosted one of the great literary and social salons of the 1920s and 30s. He continued to be highly productive, writing plays, short stories, novels, essays and travel books. By 1940, when the [[Battle of France|collapse of France]] and its [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation by the German Third Reich]] forced Maugham to leave the French Riviera, he was a refugee\u2014but one of the wealthiest and most famous writers in the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMaugham's short fable \"An Appointment in [[Samarra]]\" (1933) is based on an ancient [[Babylonia]]n myth: Death is both the narrator and a central character.<ref>[http://www.k-state.edu/english/baker/english320/Maugham-AS.htm K-State.edu Baker, \"Maugham's version of ''An Appointment in Samarra''\"], Kansas State University</ref><ref>An older version of ''An Appointment in Samarra'' is recorded in the ''Babylonian Talmud,'' Sukkah 53a.</ref> The American writer [[John O'Hara]] credited Maugham's tale as the inspiration for the title of his novel ''[[Appointment in Samarra]]''.\n\n==Grand old man of letters==\nIn his sixties, Maugham lived for most of the Second World War in the United States, first in [[Los Angeles]], where he worked on many screenplays, and was one of the first authors to make significant money from film adaptations. He later lived in [[Southern United States|the South]]. While in the US before that country's entry into the war, he was asked by the British government to make patriotic speeches to induce the US to aid Britain, if not necessarily become an allied combatant. After his companion Gerald Haxton died in 1944, Maugham returned to England. In private, Maugham espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jewish refugees, noting that \"the [[Gestapo]] is known to have had spies among refugees, and these have not seldom been Jews\".<ref>Kushner, Tony. ''The Persistence of Prejudice: Antisemitism in British Society during the Second World War''. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1989, p. 117</ref> After the war, in 1946 Maugham returned to his villa in France. He lived there until his death, with time away for frequent and long travels.\n\nIn that period, Maugham began a relationship with Alan Searle, whom he had first met in 1928. A younger man from the London slum area of [[Bermondsey]], Searle had already been kept, or supported by older men. He proved a devoted if not a stimulating companion. One of Maugham's friends, describing the difference between Haxton and Searle, said simply: \"Gerald was vintage, Alan was ''vin ordinaire''.\"<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 495.</ref>\n\nMaugham's love life was almost never smooth. He once confessed: \"I have most loved people who cared little or nothing for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed&nbsp;... In order not to hurt their feelings, I have often acted a passion I did not feel.\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\"/>\n\nIn 1962 Maugham sold a collection of paintings, some of which had already been assigned by deed to his daughter [[Mary Elizabeth Maugham|Liza]]. She sued her father and won a judgment of \u00a3230,000. Maugham publicly disowned her and claimed she was not his biological daughter. He adopted Searle as his son and heir, but the adoption was annulled. In his 1962 volume of memoirs, ''Looking Back'', he attacked the late Syrie Maugham and wrote that Liza had been born before they married. The memoir cost him several friends and exposed him to much public ridicule. Liza and her husband Lord Glendevon contested the change in Maugham's will in the French courts, and it was overturned. \n\nBut after Maugham's death, in 1965 Searle inherited \u00a350,000, the contents of the Villa La Mauresque, Maugham's manuscripts, and his revenue from copyrights for 30 years. Thereafter the copyrights passed to the [[Royal Literary Fund]].\n\nThere is no grave for Maugham. His ashes were scattered near the Maugham Library, [[The King's School, Canterbury]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Small and weak as a boy, Maugham had been proud even then of his stamina, and as an adult he kept churning out the books, proud that he could. Yet, despite his triumphs, he never attracted the highest respect from the critics or his peers. Maugham attributed this to his lack of \"lyrical quality\", his small vocabulary, and failure to make expert use of metaphor in his work. In 1934 the American journalist and radio personality [[Alexander Woollcott]] offered Maugham some language advice: \"The female ''implies'', and from that the male ''infers''.\" Maugham responded: \"I am not yet too old to learn.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last =Hoyt\n| first =Edwin P.\n| authorlink =\n| title =Alexander Woollcott: The Man Who Came to Dinner\n| publisher =Abelard-Schuman\n| year =1968\n| location =New York\n| page =[https://archive.org/details/alexanderwoollco00hoyt/page/258 258]\n| url =https://archive.org/details/alexanderwoollco00hoyt\n| url-access =registration\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn =}}</ref>\n\nMaugham wrote at a time when experimental [[modernist]] literature such as that of [[William Faulkner]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] was gaining increasing popularity and winning critical acclaim. In this context, his plain prose style was criticized as \"such a tissue of clich\u00e9s that one's wonder is finally aroused at the writer's ability to assemble so many and at his unfailing inability to put anything in an individual way\".<ref>[[Edmund Wilson]], quoted in [[Gore Vidal]], 1990, p. 10.</ref>\n\nFor a public man of Maugham's generation, being openly gay was impossible. Whether his own orientation disgusted him (as it did many at a time when homosexuality was widely considered a moral failing as well as illegal) or whether he was trying to disguise his leanings, Maugham wrote disparagingly of the gay artist. In ''Don Fernando'', a non-fiction book about his years living in Spain, Maugham pondered a (perhaps fanciful) suggestion that the painter [[El Greco]] was homosexual:\n\n<blockquote>It cannot be denied that the homosexual has a narrower outlook on the world than the normal man. In certain respects the natural responses of the species are denied to him. Some at least of the broad and typical human emotions he can never experience. However subtly he sees life he cannot see it whole...I cannot now help asking myself whether what I see in El Greco's work of tortured fantasy and sinister strangeness is not due to such a sexual abnormality as this.<ref>''Don Fernando'' 1935, revised 1950, p. 141 of Mandarin edition of 1990.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut Maugham's homosexuality or bisexuality is believed to have shaped his fiction in two ways. Since he tended to see attractive women as sexual rivals, he often gave his women characters sexual needs and appetites, in a way quite unusual for authors of his time.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} ''Liza of Lambeth'', ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'', ''[[The Painted Veil (novel)|The Painted Veil]]'', ''Neil MacAdam'' and ''[[The Razor's Edge]]'' all featured women determined to feed their strong sexual appetites, heedless of the result. As Maugham's sexual appetites were then officially disapproved of, or criminal, in nearly all of the countries in which he travelled, the author was unusually tolerant of the vices of others.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pritchett |first1=V.S. |editor1-last=Curtis |editor1-first=Anthony |editor2-last=Whitehead |editor2-first=John |title=W.

From 1951, some 14 years before his death, his paintings began their exhibition life.

Philip's [[clubfoot]] causes him endless self-consciousness and embarrassment, echoing Maugham's struggles with his stutter and, as his biographer Ted Morgan notes, his homosexuality.<ref>Ted Morgan. Maugham: A Biography. Simon and Schuster, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0671505813}}</ref>\n\nTwo of his later novels were based on historical people: ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' is about the life of [[Paul Gauguin]]; and ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'' contains what were taken as thinly veiled and unflattering characterisations of the authors [[Thomas Hardy]] (who had died two years previously) and [[Hugh Walpole]]. Maugham himself denied any intention of doing this in a long letter to Walpole:<ref name=Walpole>{{cite book |last=Hart-Davis |first=Rupert |title=Hugh Walpole |year=1985 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-241-11406-3 |pages=316\u2013317}}</ref> \"I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you. He is made up of a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself\"\u2014yet in an introduction written for the 1950 [[Modern Library]] edition of the work, he plainly states that Walpole was the inspiration for Kear (while denying that Thomas Hardy was the inspiration for the novelist Driffield). Maugham's last major novel, ''[[The Razor's Edge]]'' (1944), was a departure for him in many ways. While much of the novel takes place in Europe, its main characters are American, not British. The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of the First World War who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle, traveling to India seeking enlightenment. The story's themes of Eastern mysticism and [[war-weariness]] struck a chord with readers during the Second World War. It was adapted into a [[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|major motion picture]], released in 1946, starring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell, with [[Herbert Marshall]] as W. Somerset Maugham. Another film adaptation was issued in [[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|1984]], starring [[Bill Murray]].\n\nAmong his short stories, some of the most memorable are those dealing with the lives of Western, mostly British, colonists in the Pacific Islands and Asia.  They typically express the emotional toll the colonists bear by their isolation. \"[[Rain (short story)|Rain]]\", \"Footprints in the Jungle\", and \"The Outstation\" are considered especially notable. \"Rain\", in particular, which charts the moral disintegration of a [[missionary]] attempting to convert prostitute Sadie Thompson, has kept its reputation. It has been adapted as a play and as several films. His ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' (1908) is based on British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Ted |date= |title=Somerset Maugham |url=https://archive.org/details/somersetmaugham0000morg |url-access=registration |location=London |publisher=Jonathan Cape |page=[https://archive.org/details/somersetmaugham0000morg/page/118 118] |isbn=0224018132}}</ref>\n\nMaugham was one of the most significant travel writers of the inter-war years, and can be compared with contemporaries such as [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Freya Stark]]. His best efforts in this line include ''The Gentleman in the Parlour'', dealing with a journey through Burma, Siam, Cambodia and Vietnam, and ''On a Chinese Screen'', a series of very brief vignettes that might have been sketches for stories left unwritten. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Influence==\nIn 1947 Maugham instituted the [[Somerset Maugham Award]],<ref name=\"Meyers\">{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |title=Somerset Maugham: A Life |year=2004 |publisher=Alfred A.

He was among the most popular writers of his era and reputedly the highest-paid author during the 1930s.<ref>[http://www.online-literature.com/maugham/ \"W. Somerset Maugham\"], The Literature Network</ref>\n\nBoth Maugham's parents died before he was 10, and the orphaned boy was raised by a paternal uncle who was emotionally cold. He did not want to become a lawyer like other men in his family, so he trained and qualified as a physician. His first novel ''[[Liza of Lambeth]]'' (1897) sold out so rapidly that Maugham gave up medicine to write full-time.\n\nDuring the First World War, he served with the [[Red Cross]] and in the ambulance corps before being recruited in 1916 into the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]]. He worked for the service in Switzerland and Russia before the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 in the Russian Empire. During and after the war, he travelled in India, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. He drew from those experiences in his later short stories and novels.\n\n==Childhood and education==\nMaugham was the fourth of six sons born in his family. Their father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was a lawyer who handled the legal affairs of the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]].<ref name=\"maugham1\">Maugham, Somerset 1962.</ref> Since French law declared that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, diplomatically considered British soil.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 4.</ref> His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the [[Law Society of England and Wales]].<ref>Maugham, Robin 1977.</ref> Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 of his literary memoir, ''[[The Summing Up]]'': {{Quote\n|text=\"...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum there is a long list of his legal works.  He wrote only one book that was not of this character.  It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I have not been able to get hold of a copy since.  I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmQUAAAAQAAJ&dq=outlines+of+character&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Outlines of character, the great character, the English character [&c.] by a member of the Philomathic institution|last=Outlines|date=1823|language=en}}</ref>}}\nHis family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, [[Frederic Maugham, 1st Viscount Maugham|Viscount Maugham]], did become a lawyer, enjoying a distinguished legal career and serving as [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1938 to 1939.\n\nMaugham's mother, Edith Mary (n\u00e9e Snell), contracted [[tuberculosis]], a condition for which her physician prescribed childbirth.{{sfn|Hastings|2010}} She had Maugham several years after the last of his three elder brothers was born. By the time Maugham was three, his older brothers were all away at boarding school.\n\nEdith's sixth and final son died on 25 January 1882, one day after his birth. It was Maugham's eighth birthday. Edith died of tuberculosis six days later on 31 January at the age of 41.<ref>Meyers, 2004, p. 11.</ref> The early death of his mother left Maugham traumatized. He kept his mother's photograph at his bedside for the rest of his life.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> Two years after Edith's death, Maugham's father died in France of cancer.\n\nMaugham was sent back to the UK to be cared for by his paternal uncle, Henry MacDonald Maugham, the Vicar of [[Whitstable]], in Kent. The move was damaging. Henry Maugham was cold and emotionally cruel.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The boy attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], which was also difficult for him. He was teased for his bad English (French had been his first language) and his short stature, which he inherited from his father. Maugham developed a [[Stuttering|stammer]] that stayed with him all his life. It was sporadic, being subject to his moods and circumstances.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 17.</ref> Miserable both at his uncle's vicarage and at school, the young Maugham developed a talent for making wounding remarks to those who displeased him. This ability is sometimes reflected in Maugham's literary characters.\n\nAt age 16, Maugham refused to continue at The King's School. His uncle allowed him to travel to Germany, where he studied literature, philosophy and German at [[Heidelberg University]]. During his year in Heidelberg, Maugham met and had a sexual affair with [[John Ellingham Brooks]], an Englishman ten years his senior.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 24.</ref> He also wrote his first book there, a biography of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], an [[opera]] composer.<ref>Epstein, 1991, p. 189.</ref>\n\nAfter Maugham's return to Britain, his uncle found him a position in an accountant's office. After a month Maugham gave it up and returned to Whitstable. His uncle tried to find Maugham a new profession. Maugham's father and three older brothers were distinguished lawyers; but Maugham was not interested in this profession. He rejected a career in the Church because of his stutter. His uncle rejected the Civil Service, believing that it was no longer a career for gentlemen after a new law requiring applicants to pass an entrance examination. The local physician suggested the medical profession and Maugham's uncle agreed.\n\nMaugham had been writing steadily since he was 15, and wanted to be an author, but he did not tell his guardian. For the next five years, he studied medicine at [[St Thomas's Hospital Medical School]] in [[Lambeth]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:Maugham facing camera.jpg|thumb|upright|W. Somerset Maugham]]\nMaugham was living in the great city of London, meeting people of a \"low\" sort whom he would never have met otherwise, and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student: \"I saw how men died. I saw how they bore pain. I saw what hope looked like, fear and relief&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\">{{cite book|last=Maugham|first=Somerset|title=[[The Summing Up]]|year=1938|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London}}</ref>\n\nMaugham kept his own lodgings, took pleasure in furnishing them, filled many notebooks with literary ideas, and continued writing nightly while at the same time studying for his medical degree. In 1897, he published his first novel, ''[[Liza of Lambeth]]'', a tale of working-class adultery and its consequences. It drew its details from Maugham's experiences as a medical student doing [[midwifery]] work in [[Lambeth]], a South London slum. Maugham wrote near the opening of the novel: \"...&nbsp;it is impossible always to give the exact unexpurgated words of Liza and the other personages of the story; the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts to piece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue.\"<ref>Maugham, ''Liza of Lambeth'' (Rockville, MD: Serenity Publishers, 2008), p. 10.</ref>\n\n''Liza of Lambeth'''s first print run sold out in a matter of weeks. Maugham, who had qualified as a medic, dropped medicine and embarked on his 65-year career as a man of letters. He later said, \"I took to it as a duck takes to water.\"<ref>Maugham, ''The Partial View'' (Heineman 1954), p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe writer's life allowed Maugham to travel and to live in places such as Spain and [[Capri]] for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of ''Liza''. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play ''[[Lady Frederick]]''. By the next year, he had four plays running simultaneously in London, and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously as he looked at the billboards.\n\nMaugham's supernatural thriller, ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' (1908), based its principal character on the well-known and somewhat disreputable [[Aleister Crowley]]. Crowley took some offence at the treatment of the protagonist, Oliver Haddo. He wrote a critique of the novel, charging Maugham with plagiarism, in a review published in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Crowley's ''Vanity Fair'' review is reprinted in Anthony Curtis and John Whitehead, eds., ''W. Somerset Maugham The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge Kegan & Paul, 1987), pp. 44\u201356.</ref> Maugham survived the criticism without much damage to his reputation.\n\n===Popular success, 1914\u201339===\nBy 1914, Maugham was famous, with 10 plays produced and 10 novels published. Too old to enlist when the First World War broke out, he served in France as a member of the [[British Red Cross]]'s so-called \"[[List of ambulance drivers during World War I#Writers|Literary Ambulance Drivers]]\", a group of some 24 well-known writers, including the Americans [[John Dos Passos]], [[E. E. Cummings]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]].\n[[File:Maugham early career.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maugham early in his career]]\n\nDuring this time he met [[Gerald Haxton|Frederick Gerald Haxton]], a young [[San Francisco, California|San Franciscan]], who became his companion and lover until Haxton's death in 1944.<ref>Haxton appears as Tony Paxton in Maugham's 1917 play, ''Our Betters''.</ref> Throughout this period, Maugham continued to write. He proofread ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' at a location near [[Dunkirk]] during a lull in his ambulance duties.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 188.</ref>\n\n''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' (1915) initially was criticized in both England and the United States; the ''[[New York World]]'' described the romantic obsession of the protagonist Philip Carey as \"the sentimental servitude of a poor fool\". The influential American novelist and critic [[Theodore Dreiser]] rescued the novel, referring to it as a work of genius and comparing it to a [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] symphony. His review gave the book a lift, and it has never been out of print since.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 197\u20138.</ref>\n\nMaugham indicates in his foreword that he derived the title from a passage in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Ethics'':\n:\"The impotence of man to govern or restrain the emotions I call bondage, for a man who is under their control is not his own master&nbsp;... so that he is often forced to follow the worse, although he see the better before him.\"<ref>Ruth Franklin, \"The Great and the Good,\" ''The New Yorker'', 31 May 2010, retrieved 6 September 2012</ref>\n\n''Of Human Bondage'' is considered to have many autobiographical elements. Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot (rather than his stammer); the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable; and Carey is a medic. Maugham insisted the book was more invention than fact. The close relationship between fictional and non-fictional became Maugham's trademark. He wrote in 1938: \"Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now, looking back on it, I can hardly distinguish one from the other.\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\"/>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nMaugham entered into a relationship with [[Gwendoline Maud Syrie Barnardo|Syrie Wellcome]], the wife of [[Henry Wellcome]], an American-born English pharmaceutical magnate. They had a daughter named [[Mary Elizabeth Maugham|Mary Elizabeth]] (1915\u20131998).<ref>(Her birth name is recorded as Mary Elizabeth Wellcome in the immigration and naturalization files of [[Ellis Island]], along with her mother, who is listed as Syrie Wellcome, on the 21 July 1916 manifest of HMS ''Baltic''.)</ref> Henry Wellcome sued his wife for divorce, naming Maugham as co-respondent.<ref name=\"wellcome\">{{cite web | title=Syrie and Mounteney Wellcome | author=Bailey, Penny | work=Wellcome Trust | url=http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/History/WTX052197.htm | accessdate=2013-11-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1917, following the ''[[decree absolute]]'', Syrie Wellcome and Maugham were married. Syrie Maugham became a noted interior decorator who in the 1920s popularized \"the all-white room\". They changed their daughter's surname, originally registered as Wellcome and reflecting Syrie's marriage. She was familiarly called Liza and her surname was changed to Maugham.\n\nThe marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated.

Somerset Maugham, ''A Writer\u2019s Notebook'' (1949).</ref>\n\n==Intelligence work==\nMaugham returned to Britain from his ambulance unit duties in order to promote ''Of Human Bondage''. With that completed, he was eager to assist the war effort again. As he was unable to return to his ambulance unit, Syrie arranged for him to be introduced to a high-ranking intelligence officer known as \"R\"; he was recruited by [[John Wallinger]].<ref name=Popplewell230>{{Harvnb|Popplewell|1995|p=230.}}</ref> In September 1915, Maugham began work in Switzerland, as one of the network of British agents who operated against the [[Berlin Committee]], whose members included [[Virendranath Chattopadhyay]], an Indian revolutionary trying to resist colonial Britain's rule of India. Maugham lived in Switzerland as a writer.\n\nIn June 1917, Maugham was asked by Sir [[William G. E. Wiseman|William Wiseman]], an officer of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (later named MI6), to undertake a special mission in Russia.<ref name=\"Popplewell230\"/><ref name = \"Morgan 1980 p227\">Morgan, 1980, p. 227.</ref> It was part of an attempt to keep the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] in power and Russia in the war by countering German pacifist propaganda.<ref name = \"Morgan 1980 p226\">Morgan, 1980, p. 226.</ref> Two and a half months later, the [[Bolsheviks]] took control. Maugham subsequently said that if he had been able to get there six months earlier, he might have succeeded. Quiet and observant, Maugham had a good temperament for intelligence work; he believed he had inherited from his lawyer father a gift for cool judgment and the ability to avoid being deceived by facile appearances.<ref name=\"Popplewell230\"/><ref name=Woods55>{{Harvnb|Woods|2007|p=55.}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nMaugham used his spying experiences as the basis for ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'', a collection of short stories about a gentlemanly, sophisticated, aloof spy. This character is considered to have influenced [[Ian Fleming]]'s later series of ''[[James Bond]]'' novels.<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 206.</ref> In 1922, Maugham dedicated his book ''On A Chinese Screen'' to Syrie. This was a collection of 58 ultra-short story sketches, which he had written during his 1920 travels through China and Hong Kong, intending to expand the sketches later as a book.<ref>Morgan, 1980, pp. 245, 264.</ref>\n\n==Travels and writing==\nIn 1916, Maugham travelled to the Pacific to research his novel ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'', based on the life of [[Paul Gauguin]]. This was the first of his journeys through the late-Imperial world of the 1920s and 1930s that inspired his novels. He became known as a writer who portrayed the last days of European colonialism in India, Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific, although the books on which this reputation rests represent only a fraction of his output. On this and all subsequent journeys, he was accompanied by Haxton, whom he regarded as indispensable to his success as a writer. Maugham was painfully shy, and Haxton the extrovert gathered human material which the author drew from for his fiction.\n\nMaugham's play ''[[The Letter (play)|The Letter]]'', starring [[Gladys Cooper]], had its premiere in London in 1927. Later, he asked that [[Katharine Cornell]] play the lead in the 1927 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version. He had adapted it for the stage from a story published in 1924 in [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Hearst's International]]; it was reprinted in his collection ''[[The Casuarina Tree]]'' (1926). \n\nThe play was adapted as a film [[The Letter (1929 film)|by the same name]] in 1929. [[Jeanne Eagels]] had the lead. A second film adaptation was released [[The Letter (1940 film)|in 1940]], starring  American actress [[Bette Davis]], who was nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress for her performance. In 1951, Katherine Cornell was a great success playing the lead in Maugham's comedy ''[[The Constant Wife]]''.<ref>Tad Mosel, ''Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell,'' Little, Brown & Co., Boston (1978)</ref>{{page needed|date=March  2020}}\n\nIn 1926, Maugham bought the [[Villa La Mauresque]], on 9 acres (3.6 hectares) at [[Cap Ferrat]] on the [[French Riviera]]. It was his home for most of the rest of his life. There he hosted one of the great literary and social salons of the 1920s and 30s. He continued to be highly productive, writing plays, short stories, novels, essays and travel books. By 1940, when the [[Battle of France|collapse of France]] and its [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation by the German Third Reich]] forced Maugham to leave the French Riviera, he was a refugee\u2014but one of the wealthiest and most famous writers in the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMaugham's short fable \"An Appointment in [[Samarra]]\" (1933) is based on an ancient [[Babylonia]]n myth: Death is both the narrator and a central character.<ref>[http://www.k-state.edu/english/baker/english320/Maugham-AS.htm K-State.edu Baker, \"Maugham's version of ''An Appointment in Samarra''\"], Kansas State University</ref><ref>An older version of ''An Appointment in Samarra'' is recorded in the ''Babylonian Talmud,'' Sukkah 53a.</ref> The American writer [[John O'Hara]] credited Maugham's tale as the inspiration for the title of his novel ''[[Appointment in Samarra]]''.\n\n==Grand old man of letters==\nIn his sixties, Maugham lived for most of the Second World War in the United States, first in [[Los Angeles]], where he worked on many screenplays, and was one of the first authors to make significant money from film adaptations. He later lived in [[Southern United States|the South]]. While in the US before that country's entry into the war, he was asked by the British government to make patriotic speeches to induce the US to aid Britain, if not necessarily become an allied combatant. After his companion Gerald Haxton died in 1944, Maugham returned to England. In private, Maugham espoused antisemitic conspiracy theories about Jewish refugees, noting that \"the [[Gestapo]] is known to have had spies among refugees, and these have not seldom been Jews\".<ref>Kushner, Tony. ''The Persistence of Prejudice: Antisemitism in British Society during the Second World War''. Manchester: Manchester UP, 1989, p. 117</ref> After the war, in 1946 Maugham returned to his villa in France. He lived there until his death, with time away for frequent and long travels.\n\nIn that period, Maugham began a relationship with Alan Searle, whom he had first met in 1928. A younger man from the London slum area of [[Bermondsey]], Searle had already been kept, or supported by older men. He proved a devoted if not a stimulating companion. One of Maugham's friends, describing the difference between Haxton and Searle, said simply: \"Gerald was vintage, Alan was ''vin ordinaire''.\"<ref>Morgan, 1980, p. 495.</ref>\n\nMaugham's love life was almost never smooth. He once confessed: \"I have most loved people who cared little or nothing for me and when people have loved me I have been embarrassed&nbsp;... In order not to hurt their feelings, I have often acted a passion I did not feel.\"<ref name=\"Summing Up\"/>\n\nIn 1962 Maugham sold a collection of paintings, some of which had already been assigned by deed to his daughter [[Mary Elizabeth Maugham|Liza]]. She sued her father and won a judgment of \u00a3230,000. Maugham publicly disowned her and claimed she was not his biological daughter. He adopted Searle as his son and heir, but the adoption was annulled. In his 1962 volume of memoirs, ''Looking Back'', he attacked the late Syrie Maugham and wrote that Liza had been born before they married. The memoir cost him several friends and exposed him to much public ridicule. Liza and her husband Lord Glendevon contested the change in Maugham's will in the French courts, and it was overturned. \n\nBut after Maugham's death, in 1965 Searle inherited \u00a350,000, the contents of the Villa La Mauresque, Maugham's manuscripts, and his revenue from copyrights for 30 years. Thereafter the copyrights passed to the [[Royal Literary Fund]].\n\nThere is no grave for Maugham. His ashes were scattered near the Maugham Library, [[The King's School, Canterbury]].<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Small and weak as a boy, Maugham had been proud even then of his stamina, and as an adult he kept churning out the books, proud that he could. Yet, despite his triumphs, he never attracted the highest respect from the critics or his peers. Maugham attributed this to his lack of \"lyrical quality\", his small vocabulary, and failure to make expert use of metaphor in his work. In 1934 the American journalist and radio personality [[Alexander Woollcott]] offered Maugham some language advice: \"The female ''implies'', and from that the male ''infers''.\" Maugham responded: \"I am not yet too old to learn.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last =Hoyt\n| first =Edwin P.\n| authorlink =\n| title =Alexander Woollcott: The Man Who Came to Dinner\n| publisher =Abelard-Schuman\n| year =1968\n| location =New York\n| page =[https://archive.org/details/alexanderwoollco00hoyt/page/258 258]\n| url =https://archive.org/details/alexanderwoollco00hoyt\n| url-access =registration\n| doi =\n| id =\n| isbn =}}</ref>\n\nMaugham wrote at a time when experimental [[modernist]] literature such as that of [[William Faulkner]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[James Joyce]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] was gaining increasing popularity and winning critical acclaim. In this context, his plain prose style was criticized as \"such a tissue of clich\u00e9s that one's wonder is finally aroused at the writer's ability to assemble so many and at his unfailing inability to put anything in an individual way\".<ref>[[Edmund Wilson]], quoted in [[Gore Vidal]], 1990, p. 10.</ref>\n\nFor a public man of Maugham's generation, being openly gay was impossible. Whether his own orientation disgusted him (as it did many at a time when homosexuality was widely considered a moral failing as well as illegal) or whether he was trying to disguise his leanings, Maugham wrote disparagingly of the gay artist. In ''Don Fernando'', a non-fiction book about his years living in Spain, Maugham pondered a (perhaps fanciful) suggestion that the painter [[El Greco]] was homosexual:\n\n<blockquote>It cannot be denied that the homosexual has a narrower outlook on the world than the normal man. In certain respects the natural responses of the species are denied to him. Some at least of the broad and typical human emotions he can never experience. However subtly he sees life he cannot see it whole...I cannot now help asking myself whether what I see in El Greco's work of tortured fantasy and sinister strangeness is not due to such a sexual abnormality as this.<ref>''Don Fernando'' 1935, revised 1950, p. 141 of Mandarin edition of 1990.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut Maugham's homosexuality or bisexuality is believed to have shaped his fiction in two ways. Since he tended to see attractive women as sexual rivals, he often gave his women characters sexual needs and appetites, in a way quite unusual for authors of his time.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} ''Liza of Lambeth'', ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'', ''[[The Painted Veil (novel)|The Painted Veil]]'', ''Neil MacAdam'' and ''[[The Razor's Edge]]'' all featured women determined to feed their strong sexual appetites, heedless of the result. As Maugham's sexual appetites were then officially disapproved of, or criminal, in nearly all of the countries in which he travelled, the author was unusually tolerant of the vices of others.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pritchett |first1=V.S. |editor1-last=Curtis |editor1-first=Anthony |editor2-last=Whitehead |editor2-first=John |title=W.

From 1951, some 14 years before his death, his paintings began their exhibition life.

Philip's [[clubfoot]] causes him endless self-consciousness and embarrassment, echoing Maugham's struggles with his stutter and, as his biographer Ted Morgan notes, his homosexuality.<ref>Ted Morgan. Maugham: A Biography. Simon and Schuster, 1984. {{ISBN|978-0671505813}}</ref>\n\nTwo of his later novels were based on historical people: ''[[The Moon and Sixpence]]'' is about the life of [[Paul Gauguin]]; and ''[[Cakes and Ale]]'' contains what were taken as thinly veiled and unflattering characterisations of the authors [[Thomas Hardy]] (who had died two years previously) and [[Hugh Walpole]]. Maugham himself denied any intention of doing this in a long letter to Walpole:<ref name=Walpole>{{cite book |last=Hart-Davis |first=Rupert |title=Hugh Walpole |year=1985 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-241-11406-3 |pages=316\u2013317}}</ref> \"I certainly never intended Alroy Kear to be a portrait of you. He is made up of a dozen people and the greater part of him is myself\"\u2014yet in an introduction written for the 1950 [[Modern Library]] edition of the work, he plainly states that Walpole was the inspiration for Kear (while denying that Thomas Hardy was the inspiration for the novelist Driffield). Maugham's last major novel, ''[[The Razor's Edge]]'' (1944), was a departure for him in many ways. While much of the novel takes place in Europe, its main characters are American, not British. The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of the First World War who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle, traveling to India seeking enlightenment. The story's themes of Eastern mysticism and [[war-weariness]] struck a chord with readers during the Second World War. It was adapted into a [[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|major motion picture]], released in 1946, starring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell, with [[Herbert Marshall]] as W. Somerset Maugham. Another film adaptation was issued in [[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|1984]], starring [[Bill Murray]].\n\nAmong his short stories, some of the most memorable are those dealing with the lives of Western, mostly British, colonists in the Pacific Islands and Asia.  They typically express the emotional toll the colonists bear by their isolation. \"[[Rain (short story)|Rain]]\", \"Footprints in the Jungle\", and \"The Outstation\" are considered especially notable. \"Rain\", in particular, which charts the moral disintegration of a [[missionary]] attempting to convert prostitute Sadie Thompson, has kept its reputation. It has been adapted as a play and as several films. His ''[[The Magician (Maugham novel)|The Magician]]'' (1908) is based on British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Ted |date= |title=Somerset Maugham |url=https://archive.org/details/somersetmaugham0000morg |url-access=registration |location=London |publisher=Jonathan Cape |page=[https://archive.org/details/somersetmaugham0000morg/page/118 118] |isbn=0224018132}}</ref>\n\nMaugham was one of the most significant travel writers of the inter-war years, and can be compared with contemporaries such as [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[Freya Stark]]. His best efforts in this line include ''The Gentleman in the Parlour'', dealing with a journey through Burma, Siam, Cambodia and Vietnam, and ''On a Chinese Screen'', a series of very brief vignettes that might have been sketches for stories left unwritten. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Influence==\nIn 1947 Maugham instituted the [[Somerset Maugham Award]],<ref name=\"Meyers\">{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |title=Somerset Maugham: A Life |year=2004 |publisher=Alfred A.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Mrs H. Iles and Albert Iles whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against Hamilton<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.
