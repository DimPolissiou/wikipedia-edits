[[Amy Gutmann]], former head of the Presidential Bioethics Commission, argued that we should avoid the temptation to over-regulate synthetic biology in general, and genetic engineering in particular. According to Gutmann, \"Regulatory parsimony is  especially important  in  emerging  technologies...where the temptation to stifle innovation on the basis of uncertainty  and  fear  of  the  unknown  is  particularly  great.  The blunt instruments of statutory and regulatory restraint  may  not  only  inhibit  the  distribution  of  new  benefits,  but  can  be  counterproductive  to  security  and safety by preventing researchers from developing effective safeguards.\".<ref>{{cite journal | first = Gutmann | last = Amy | date = 2012 | title =  The Ethics of Synthetic Biology | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages = 17\u201322 | journal = The Hastings Center Report | doi = 10.1002/j.1552-146X.2011.tb00118.x | pmid = 21845917 }}</ref>\n\n=== The \"creation\" of life ===\n\nOne ethical question is whether or not it is acceptable to create new life forms, sometimes known as \"playing God\". Currently, the creation of new life forms not present in nature is at small-scale, the potential benefits and dangers remain unknown, and careful consideration and oversight are ensured for most studies.<ref name=\":3\" /> Many advocates express the great potential value\u2014to agriculture, medicine, and academic knowledge, among other fields\u2014of creating artificial life forms. Creation of new entities could expand scientific knowledge well beyond what is currently known from studying natural phenomena. Yet there is concern that artificial life forms may reduce nature\u2019s \"purity\" (i.e., nature could be somehow corrupted by human intervention and manipulation) and potentially influence the adoption of more engineering-like principles instead of biodiversity- and nature-focused ideals. Some are also concerned that if an artificial life form were to be released into nature, it could hamper biodiversity by beating out natural species for resources (similar to how [[algal bloom]]s kill marine species). Another concern involves the ethical treatment of newly created entities if they happen to [[nociception|sense pain]], [[sentience]], and self-perception. Should such life be given moral or legal rights? If so, how?\n\n=== Biosafety ===\nWhat is most ethically appropriate when considering biosafety measures? How can accidental introduction of synthetic life in the natural environment be avoided? Much ethical consideration and critical thought has been given to these questions. Biosafety not only refers to biological containment; it also refers to strides taken to protect the public from potentially hazardous biological agents. Even though such concerns are important and remain unanswered, not all products of synthetic biology present concern for biological safety or negative consequences for the environment. Some would argue that most synthetic technologies are benign and incapable of flourishing in the outside world due to their \"unnatural\" characteristics. For instance, organisms like bacteria and yeast can be engineered to be unable to produce [[histidine]], an important amino acid for all life. Such organisms can thus only be grown on histidine-rich media in laboratory conditions, nullifying fears that they could spread into undesirable areas.\n\n=== Biosecurity ===\nSome ethical issues relate to biosecurity, where biosynthetic technologies could be deliberately used to cause harm to society and/or the environment. Since synthetic biology raises ethical issues and biosecurity issues, humanity must consider and plan on how to deal with potentially harmful creations, and what kinds of ethical measures could possibly be employed to deter nefarious biosynthetic technologies.

[[Amy Gutmann]], former head of the Presidential Bioethics Commission, argued that we should avoid the temptation to over-regulate synthetic biology in general, and genetic engineering in particular. According to Gutmann, \"Regulatory parsimony is  especially important  in  emerging  technologies...where the temptation to stifle innovation on the basis of uncertainty  and  fear  of  the  unknown  is  particularly  great.  The blunt instruments of statutory and regulatory restraint  may  not  only  inhibit  the  distribution  of  new  benefits,  but  can  be  counterproductive  to  security  and safety by preventing researchers from developing effective safeguards.\".<ref>{{cite journal | first = Gutmann | last = Amy | date = 2012 | title =  The Ethics of Synthetic Biology | volume=41 | issue=4 | pages = 17\u201322 | journal = The Hastings Center Report | doi = 10.1002/j.1552-146X.2011.tb00118.x | pmid = 21845917 }}</ref>\n\n=== The \"creation\" of life ===\n\nOne ethical question is whether or not it is acceptable to create new life forms, sometimes known as \"playing God\". Currently, the creation of new life forms not present in nature is at small-scale, the potential benefits and dangers remain unknown, and careful consideration and oversight are ensured for most studies.<ref name=\":3\" /> Many advocates express the great potential value\u2014to agriculture, medicine, and academic knowledge, among other fields\u2014of creating artificial life forms. Creation of new entities could expand scientific knowledge well beyond what is currently known from studying natural phenomena. Yet there is concern that artificial life forms may reduce nature\u2019s \"purity\" (i.e., nature could be somehow corrupted by human intervention and manipulation) and potentially influence the adoption of more engineering-like principles instead of biodiversity- and nature-focused ideals. Some are also concerned that if an artificial life form were to be released into nature, it could hamper biodiversity by beating out natural species for resources (similar to how [[algal bloom]]s kill marine species). Another concern involves the ethical treatment of newly created entities if they happen to [[nociception|sense pain]], [[sentience]], and self-perception. Should such life be given moral or legal rights? If so, how?\n\n=== Biosafety ===\nWhat is most ethically appropriate when considering biosafety measures? How can accidental introduction of synthetic life in the natural environment be avoided? Much ethical consideration and critical thought has been given to these questions. Biosafety not only refers to biological containment; it also refers to strides taken to protect the public from potentially hazardous biological agents. Even though such concerns are important and remain unanswered, not all products of synthetic biology present concern for biological safety or negative consequences for the environment. Some would argue that most synthetic technologies are benign and incapable of flourishing in the outside world due to their \"unnatural\" characteristics. For instance, organisms like bacteria and yeast can be engineered to be unable to produce [[histidine]], an important amino acid for all life. Such organisms can thus only be grown on histidine-rich media in laboratory conditions, nullifying fears that they could spread into undesirable areas.\n\n=== Biosecurity ===\nSome ethical issues relate to biosecurity, where biosynthetic technologies could be deliberately used to cause harm to society and/or the environment. Since synthetic biology raises ethical issues and biosecurity issues, humanity must consider and plan on how to deal with potentially harmful creations, and what kinds of ethical measures could possibly be employed to deter nefarious biosynthetic technologies.

North of this was [[Caledonia]], inhabited by the ''Picti'', whose uprisings forced Rome's legions back to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. As Rome finally [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|withdrew from Britain]], [[Gaels|Gaelic]] raiders called the ''[[Scoti]]'' began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. Prior to Roman times, [[prehistoric Scotland]] entered the [[Neolithic Era]] about 4000&nbsp;BC, the [[Bronze Age]] about 2000&nbsp;BC, and the [[Iron Age]] around 700&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe Gaelic kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the 6th century. In the following century, [[History of Christianity in Ireland|Irish]] missionaries introduced the previously [[Pictish religion|pagan Picts]] to [[Celtic church|Celtic Christianity]]. Following [[Saxon England|England]]'s [[Gregorian mission]], the Pictish king [[Nechtan mac Der-Ilei|Nechtan]] chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman rite]], restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglian]] [[Northumbria]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/sysm/scots/teachers/background.shtml | title = Scots and Picts | publisher = BBC Education Scotland | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref> Towards the end of the 8th century, the [[Viking invasions of Scotland|Viking invasions]] began, forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other and to unite in the 9th century, forming the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Scotland was united under the [[House of Alpin]], whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. The last Alpin king, [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], died without issue in the early 11th century and the kingdom passed through his daughter's son to the [[House of Dunkeld]] or Canmore. The last Dunkeld king, [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], died in 1286. He left only his infant granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] as heir, who died herself four years later. England, under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], would take advantage of this questioned succession to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], as Scotland passed back and forth between the [[House of Balliol]] and the [[House of Bruce]]. Scotland's ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.\n\nWhen [[David II of Scotland|King David II]] died without issue, his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] established the [[House of Stuart]], which would rule Scotland uncontested for the next three centuries. [[James I of England|James VI]], Stuart king of Scotland, also inherited the throne of England in 1603, and the Stuart kings and queens ruled both independent kingdoms until the [[Acts of Union, 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 merged the two kingdoms into a new state, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm | title = Uniting the kingdom? | publisher = National Archives | accessdate = 2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | title = Union of Crowns to Union of Parliaments: The Union of the Parliaments 1707 | publisher = [[Education Scotland]] | accessdate = 23 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121202825/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | archive-date = 21 November 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Union with England Act 1707]], Article II.</ref> Ruling until 1714, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last Stuart monarch. Since 1714, the succession of the [[British monarchs]] of the houses of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Windsor)]] has been due to their descent from [[James VI and I]] of the House of Stuart.\n\nDuring the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its [[de-industrialization|industrial decline]] following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent [[financial services]] sector and the proceeds of [[North Sea oil]] and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on [[Scottish independence]], and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Pre-history==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}\n[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest standing house in Northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], dating from 3500&nbsp;BC.]]\nPeople lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before Britain's [[recorded history]].

However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son [[Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany|Murdoch]].

Within two years, the [[Rough Wooing]] began, Henry VIII's military attempt to force a marriage between Mary and his son, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]]. This took the form of border skirmishing and several English campaigns into Scotland. In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII, forces under the English regent [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] were victorious at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]], the climax of the Rough Wooing, and followed up by the occupation of [[Siege of Haddington|Haddington]]. Mary was then sent to France at the age of five, as the intended bride of the heir to the French throne. Her mother, Marie de Guise, stayed in Scotland to look after the interests of Mary \u2013 and of France \u2013 although the [[James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran|Earl of Arran]] acted officially as regent.<ref>Dawson, ''Scotland Re-formed, 1488\u20131587''</ref> Guise responded by calling on French troops, who helped stiffen resistance to the English occupation. By 1550, after a change of regent in England, the English withdrew from Scotland completely.\n\nFrom 1554, Marie de Guise, took over the regency, and continued to advance French interests in Scotland. French cultural influence resulted in a large influx of French vocabulary into [[Scots language|Scots]]. But anti-French sentiment also grew, particularly among [[Protestant]]s, who saw the English as their natural allies. In 1560, Marie de Guise died, and soon after the Auld Alliance also ended, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]], which provided for the removal of French and English troops from Scotland. The [[Scottish Reformation]] took place only days later when the [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Scottish Parliament]] abolished the [[Roman Catholic]] religion and outlawed the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 115\u201317.</ref>\n\n[[File:The murder of David Rizzio from the Duke of Buccleuch statue.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[David Rizzio]]'s murder in 1566]]\nMeanwhile, Queen Mary had been raised as a Catholic in France, and married to the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]], who became king as [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] in 1559, making her queen consort of France.<ref>J.

Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, [[David Riccio]], was followed by that of her unpopular second husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], and her abduction by and marriage to the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was implicated in Darnley's murder.<ref>Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 129\u201333.</ref> Mary and Bothwell confronted the lords at [[Battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]] and after their forces melted away, he fled and she was captured by Bothwell's rivals.

In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars, often training for the priesthood, who had visited Continental universities. The Lutheran preacher [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] was executed for heresy in [[St. Andrews]] in 1528.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102\u20134.</ref> The execution of others, especially the [[Zwingli]]-influenced [[George Wishart]], who was burnt at the stake on the orders of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] in 1546, angered Protestants. Wishart's supporters assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain [[John Knox]], were condemned to be galley slaves in France, stoking resentment of the French and creating martyrs for the Protestant cause.<ref>M. F. Graham, \"Scotland\", in A. Pettegree, ''The Reformation World'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 414.</ref>\n\nLimited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves [[Lords of the Congregation]] in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament in 1560]], while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 120\u20131.</ref>\n\nKnox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva as a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure of the period. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. The reformed Kirk gave considerable power to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy. There were widespread, but generally orderly outbreaks of [[iconoclasm]]. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the Kirk found it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 121\u201333.</ref>\n\nWomen shared in the religiosity of the day. The egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, \"Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women.\" Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship in the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles,And took a prominent place in prayer societies.<ref>Alasdair Raffe, \"Female Authority and Lay Activism in Scottish\nPresbyterianism, 1660\u20131740\" in Sarah Apetrei and Hannah Smith, eds.

In 1644, [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] under [[Alasdair Mac Colla|Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)]], and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] began in September 1644 with his victory at [[battle of Tippermuir]]. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]]. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.<ref name=autogenerated3>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 217\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians.

Cromwell emerged as the leading figure in the English government and Scotland was occupied by an English force under [[George Monck]]. The country was incorporated into the Puritan-governed [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and lost its independent church government, parliament and legal system, but gained access to English markets.<ref>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 221\u20134.</ref> Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent.

He disregarded parliament, purged the Council and forced through [[religious toleration]] to Roman Catholics, alienating his Protestant subjects. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\". The Estates issued a ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.<ref name=\"Mackieetal1991pp241-5\"/> The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops who had generally supported James.

Run rig was the pre-clearance method of arable farming before agricultural improvements were introduced.]]\nThe clan system of the Highlands and Islands had been seen as a challenge to the rulers of Scotland from before the 17th century. [[James VI and I|James VI's]] various measures to exert control included the [[Statutes of Iona]], an attempt to force clan leaders to become integrated into the rest of Scottish society. This started a slow process of change which, by the second half of the 18th century, saw clan chiefs start to think of themselves as commercial landlords, rather than as patriarchs of their people. To their tenants, initially this meant that monetary rents replaced those paid in kind. Later, rent increases became common.<ref name=\"Devine 1994\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clanship to Crofters' War: The social transformation of the Scottish Highlands|date=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9076-9|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|11\u201317}} In the 1710s the Dukes of Argyll started putting leases of some of their land up for auction; by 1737 this was done across the Argyll property. This commercial attitude replaced the principle of ''{{lang|gd|d\u00f9thchas}}'', which included the obligation on clan chiefs to provide land for clan members. The shift of this attitude slowly spread through the Highland elite (but not among their tenants).{{r|Devine 1994|p=41}} As clan chiefs became more integrated into Scottish and British society, many of them built up large debts. It became easier to borrow against the security of a Highland estate from the 1770s onwards. As the lenders became predominantly people and organisations outside the Highlands, there was a greater willingness to foreclose if the borrower defaulted. Combined with an astounding level of financial incompetence among the Highland elite, this ultimately forced the sale of the estates of many Highland landed families over the period 1770\u20131850. (The greatest number of sales of whole estates was toward the end of this period.)<ref name=\"Dodgshon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgshon |first1=Robert A. |title=From Chiefs to Landlords: Social and Economic Change in the Western Highlands and Islands, c.1493\u20131820 |date=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-7486-1034-0}}</ref>{{rp|105\u2013107}}{{r|Devine 1994|p=1\u201317}}{{r|Devine 2018|p=37-46, 65-73, 131-132}}\n\nThe Jacobite rebellion of 1745 gave a final period of importance to the ability of Highland clans to raise bodies of fighting men at short notice. With the defeat at Culloden, any enthusiasm for continued warfare disappeared and clan leaders returned to their transition to being commercial landlords. This was arguably accelerated by some of the punitive laws enacted after the rebellion.<ref>Stephen Conway, ''War, State, and Society in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland by Stephen Conway'' (2006), p. 139.</ref> These included the [[Heritable Jurisdictions Act]] of 1746, which removed judicial roles from clan chiefs and gave them to the Scottish law courts. [[Tom Devine|T. M. Devine]] warns against seeing a clear cause and effect relationship between the post-Culloden legislation and the collapse of clanship. He questions the basic effectiveness of the measures, quoting [[W. A. Speck]] who ascribes the pacification of the area more to \"a disinclination to rebel than to the government's repressive measures.\" Devine points out that social change in Gaeldom did not pick up until the 1760s and 1770s, as this coincided with the increased market pressures from the industrialising and urbanising Lowlands.{{r|Devine 1994|p=30-31}}\n\n41 properties belonging to rebels were forfeited to the Crown in the aftermath of the '45. The vast majority of these were sold by auction to pay creditors. 13 were retained and managed on behalf of the government between 1752 and 1784.\n\nThe changes by the Dukes of Argyll in the 1730s displaced many of the [[tacksmen]] in the area. From the 1770s onwards, this became a matter of policy throughout the Highlands. The restriction on subletting by tacksmen meant that landlords received all the rent paid by the actual farming tenants \u2013 thereby increasing their income. By the early part of the 19th century, the tacksman had become a rare component of Highland society. [[Tom Devine|T. M. Devine]] describes \"the displacement of this class as one of the clearest demonstrations of the death of the old Gaelic society.\"{{r|Devine 1994|p=34}} Many emigrated, leading parties of their tenants to North America. These tenants were from the better off part of Highland peasant society, and, together with the tacksmen, they took their capital and entrepreneurial energy to the New World, unwilling to participate in economic changes imposed by their landlords which often involved a loss of status for the tenant.{{r|Devine 1994|p=50}}<ref name=\"Devine 2006b\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clearance and Improvement: Land, Power and People in Scotland, 1700\u20131900|date=2006|publisher=Birlinn Ltd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-906566-23-4}}</ref>{{rp|173}}\n\n[[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural improvement]] was introduced across the Highlands over the relatively short period of 1760-1850. The evictions involved in this became known as the [[Highland clearances]]. There was regional variation. In the east and south of the Highlands, the old townships or ''{{lang|gd|bailtean}}'', which were farmed under the [[run rig]] system were replaced by larger enclosed farms, with fewer people holding leases and proportionately more of the population working as employees on these larger farms. (This was broadly similar to the situation in the Lowlands.) In the north and west, including the Hebrides, as land was taken out of run rig, [[Crofting]] communities were established. Much of this change involved establishing large pastoral sheep farms, with the old displaced tenants moving to new crofts in coastal areas or on poor quality land. Sheep farming was increasingly profitable at the end of the 18th century, so could pay substantially higher rents than the previous tenants. Particularly in the Hebrides, some crofting communities were established to work in the kelp industry. Others were engaged in fishing. Croft sizes were kept small, so that the occupiers were forced to seek employment to supplement what they could grow.{{r|Devine 1994|p=32-52}} This increased the number of seasonal migrant workers travelling to the Lowlands. The resulting connection with the Lowlands was highly influential on all aspects of Highland life, touching on income levels, social attitudes and language. Migrant working gave an advantage in speaking English, which came to be considered \"the language of work\".{{r|Devine 1994|p=135, 110\u2013117}}\n\nIn 1846 the [[Highland potato famine]] struck the crofting communities of the North and West Highlands. By 1850 the charitable relief effort was wound up, despite the continuing crop failure, and landlords, charities and the government resorted to encouraging emigration. The overall result was that almost 11,000 people were provided with \"assisted passages\" by their landlords between 1846 and 1856, with the greatest number travelling in 1851. A further 5,000 emigrated to Australia, through the [[Highland and Island Emigration Society]].  To this should be added an unknown, but significant number, who paid their own fares to emigrate, and a further unknown number assisted by the Colonial Land and Emigration commission.<ref name=\"Devine 1995\">{{cite book |last1=Devine |first1=T M |title=The Great Highland Famine: Hunger, Emigration and the Scottish Highlands in the Nineteenth Century |date=1995 |publisher=Birlinn Limited |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1-904607-42-X}}</ref>{{rp|201\u2013202,207,268}}{{r|Devine 2018|p=320}}{{r|Devine 1994|p=187-189}} This was out of a famine-affected population of about 200,000 people. Many of those who remained became even more involved in temporary migration for work in the Lowlands, both out of necessity during the famine and having become accustomed to working away by the time the famine ceased. Much longer periods were spent out of the Highlands \u2013 often for much of the year or more. One illustration of this migrant working was the estimated 30,000 men and women from the far west of the Gaelic speaking area who travelled to the east coast fishing ports for the herring fishing season \u2013 providing labour in an industry that grew by 60% between 1854 and 1884.{{r|Devine 2018|p=335-336}}\n\nThe clearances were followed by a period of even greater emigration from the Highlands, which continued (with a brief lull for the First World War) up to the start of the [[Great Depression]].{{r|Devine 2018|p=2}}\n\n===Enlightenment===\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economics.]]\n{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}\nHistorian [[Jonathan Israel]] argues that by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges.

The following \"Ten Years' Conflict\" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]] known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.<ref name=Robb1990/> Chalmers's ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation.<ref>J. Brown Stewart, ''Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland'' (1982)</ref> That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.<ref>S. Mechie, ''The Church and Scottish social development, 1780\u20131870'' (1960).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterian Church]] in 1893.<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the [[United Secession Church]] in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]], which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterians]] and a remnant that had not merged in 1900 as the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church]].<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/>\n\n[[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> Episcopalianism also revived in the 19th century as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the [[Episcopal Church in Scotland]] in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the [[Church of England]].<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> [[Baptist Union of Scotland|Baptist]], [[Congregational Union of Scotland|Congregationalist]] and [[Methodist]] churches had appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century,<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches.

The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions.

As a result, the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared [[Bolshevik]] revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century.<ref name=Devine&Finlay1996pp64-5/> The fear of the left had been fuelled by the emergence of a radical movement led by militant trades unionists. [[John Maclean (Scottish socialist)|John MacLean]] emerged as a key political figure in what became known as [[Red Clydeside]], and in January 1919, the British Government, fearful of a revolutionary uprising, deployed tanks and soldiers in central Glasgow. Formerly a Liberal stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base in the Irish Catholic working class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing and rent issues. However, the \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; in the face of heavy unemployment the workers' mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>I.

He launched numerous initiatives to promote Scotland, attracting businesses and new jobs through his new Scottish Council of Industry. He set up 32 committees to deal with social and economic problems, ranging from juvenile delinquency to sheep farming. He regulated rents, and set up a prototype national health service, using new hospitals set up in the expectation of large numbers of casualties from German bombing.

The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.<ref name=Buchanan2003p51/> Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion.

The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.<ref>C.

North of this was [[Caledonia]], inhabited by the ''Picti'', whose uprisings forced Rome's legions back to [[Hadrian's Wall]]. As Rome finally [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|withdrew from Britain]], [[Gaels|Gaelic]] raiders called the ''[[Scoti]]'' began colonising Western Scotland and Wales. Prior to Roman times, [[prehistoric Scotland]] entered the [[Neolithic Era]] about 4000&nbsp;BC, the [[Bronze Age]] about 2000&nbsp;BC, and the [[Iron Age]] around 700&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe Gaelic kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] was founded on the west coast of Scotland in the 6th century. In the following century, [[History of Christianity in Ireland|Irish]] missionaries introduced the previously [[Pictish religion|pagan Picts]] to [[Celtic church|Celtic Christianity]]. Following [[Saxon England|England]]'s [[Gregorian mission]], the Pictish king [[Nechtan mac Der-Ilei|Nechtan]] chose to abolish most Celtic practices in favour of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman rite]], restricting Gaelic influence on his kingdom and avoiding war with [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglian]] [[Northumbria]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/sysm/scots/teachers/background.shtml | title = Scots and Picts | publisher = BBC Education Scotland | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref> Towards the end of the 8th century, the [[Viking invasions of Scotland|Viking invasions]] began, forcing the Picts and Gaels to cease their historic hostility to each other and to unite in the 9th century, forming the [[Kingdom of Scotland]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Scotland was united under the [[House of Alpin]], whose members fought among each other during frequent disputed successions. The last Alpin king, [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], died without issue in the early 11th century and the kingdom passed through his daughter's son to the [[House of Dunkeld]] or Canmore. The last Dunkeld king, [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], died in 1286. He left only his infant granddaughter [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] as heir, who died herself four years later. England, under [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], would take advantage of this questioned succession to launch a series of conquests, resulting in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], as Scotland passed back and forth between the [[House of Balliol]] and the [[House of Bruce]]. Scotland's ultimate victory confirmed Scotland as a fully independent and sovereign kingdom.\n\nWhen [[David II of Scotland|King David II]] died without issue, his nephew [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] established the [[House of Stuart]], which would rule Scotland uncontested for the next three centuries. [[James I of England|James VI]], Stuart king of Scotland, also inherited the throne of England in 1603, and the Stuart kings and queens ruled both independent kingdoms until the [[Acts of Union, 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707 merged the two kingdoms into a new state, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/uniting.htm | title = Uniting the kingdom? | publisher = National Archives | accessdate = 2 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | title = Union of Crowns to Union of Parliaments: The Union of the Parliaments 1707 | publisher = [[Education Scotland]] | accessdate = 23 November 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121202825/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/unioncrownsparliaments/unionofparliaments/index.asp | archive-date = 21 November 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Union with England Act 1707]], Article II.</ref> Ruling until 1714, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last Stuart monarch. Since 1714, the succession of the [[British monarchs]] of the houses of [[House of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Windsor)]] has been due to their descent from [[James VI and I]] of the House of Stuart.\n\nDuring the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland became one of the commercial, intellectual and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Later, its [[de-industrialization|industrial decline]] following the Second World War was particularly acute. In recent decades Scotland has enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance, fuelled in part by a resurgent [[financial services]] sector and the proceeds of [[North Sea oil]] and gas. Since the 1950s, nationalism has become a strong political topic, with serious debates on [[Scottish independence]], and a referendum in 2014 about leaving the British Union.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Pre-history==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}\n[[File:Knapp of Howar 2.jpg|thumb|right|The oldest standing house in Northern Europe is at [[Knap of Howar]], dating from 3500&nbsp;BC.]]\nPeople lived in Scotland for at least 8,500 years before Britain's [[recorded history]].

In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars, often training for the priesthood, who had visited Continental universities. The Lutheran preacher [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]] was executed for heresy in [[St. Andrews]] in 1528.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 102\u20134.</ref> The execution of others, especially the [[Zwingli]]-influenced [[George Wishart]], who was burnt at the stake on the orders of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]] in 1546, angered Protestants. Wishart's supporters assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain [[John Knox]], were condemned to be galley slaves in France, stoking resentment of the French and creating martyrs for the Protestant cause.<ref>M. F. Graham, \"Scotland\", in A. Pettegree, ''The Reformation World'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 414.</ref>\n\nLimited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves [[Lords of the Congregation]] in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament in 1560]], while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 120\u20131.</ref>\n\nKnox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva as a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure of the period. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. The reformed Kirk gave considerable power to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy. There were widespread, but generally orderly outbreaks of [[iconoclasm]]. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the Kirk found it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.<ref>Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community'', pp. 121\u201333.</ref>\n\nWomen shared in the religiosity of the day. The egalitarian and emotional aspects of Calvinism appealed to men and women alike. Historian Alasdair Raffe finds that, \"Men and women were thought equally likely to be among the elect....Godly men valued the prayers and conversation of their female co-religionists, and this reciprocity made for loving marriages and close friendships between men and women.\" Furthermore, there was an increasingly intense relationship in the pious bonds between minister and his women parishioners. For the first time, laywomen gained numerous new religious roles,And took a prominent place in prayer societies.<ref>Alasdair Raffe, \"Female Authority and Lay Activism in Scottish\nPresbyterianism, 1660\u20131740\" in Sarah Apetrei and Hannah Smith, eds.

Parliament's demands for reform in England eventually resulted in the [[English Civil War]].

A [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was entered into, guaranteeing the Scottish Church settlement and promising further reform in England.<ref name=Mackieetal1991pp211-2>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 211\u20132.</ref> Scottish troops played a major part in the defeat of Charles I, notably at the [[battle of Marston Moor]].

In 1644, [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] attempted to raise the Highlands for the King. Few Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen troops sent by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] under [[Alasdair Mac Colla|Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)]], and an instinctive genius for mobile warfare, he was stunningly successful. A [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] began in September 1644 with his victory at [[battle of Tippermuir]]. After a series of victories over poorly trained Covenanter militias, the lowlands were at his mercy. However, at this high point, his army was reduced in size, as MacColla and the Highlanders preferred to continue the war in the north against the Campbells. Shortly after, what was left of his force was defeated at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]]. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops; but in July 1646 his army was disbanded after the King surrendered to the Scots army at Newark, and the civil war came to an end.<ref name=autogenerated3>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 217\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe following year Charles, while he was being held captive in Carisbrooke Castle, entered into an agreement with moderate Scots Presbyterians.

Oliver Cromwell led an invasion of Scotland in 1650, and defeated the Scottish army at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] and then defeated a Scottish invasion of England at [[battle of Worcester|Worcester]] on 3 September 1651 (the anniversary of his victory at Dunbar). Cromwell emerged as the leading figure in the English government and Scotland was occupied by an English force under [[George Monck]]. The country was incorporated into the Puritan-governed [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and lost its independent church government, parliament and legal system, but gained access to English markets.<ref>Mackie, Lenman and Parker, ''A History of Scotland'', pp. 221\u20134.</ref> Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent.

He disregarded parliament, purged the Council and forced through [[religious toleration]] to Roman Catholics, alienating his Protestant subjects. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\". The Estates issued a ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.<ref name=\"Mackieetal1991pp241-5\"/> The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops who had generally supported James.

Run rig was the pre-clearance method of arable farming before agricultural improvements were introduced.]]\nThe clan system of the Highlands and Islands had been seen as a challenge to the rulers of Scotland from before the 17th century. [[James VI and I|James VI's]] various measures to exert control included the [[Statutes of Iona]], an attempt to force clan leaders to become integrated into the rest of Scottish society. This started a slow process of change which, by the second half of the 18th century, saw clan chiefs start to think of themselves as commercial landlords, rather than as patriarchs of their people. To their tenants, initially this meant that monetary rents replaced those paid in kind. Later, rent increases became common.<ref name=\"Devine 1994\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clanship to Crofters' War: The social transformation of the Scottish Highlands|date=1994|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-9076-9|edition=2013}}</ref>{{rp|11\u201317}} In the 1710s the Dukes of Argyll started putting leases of some of their land up for auction; by 1737 this was done across the Argyll property. This commercial attitude replaced the principle of ''{{lang|gd|d\u00f9thchas}}'', which included the obligation on clan chiefs to provide land for clan members. The shift of this attitude slowly spread through the Highland elite (but not among their tenants).{{r|Devine 1994|p=41}} As clan chiefs became more integrated into Scottish and British society, many of them built up large debts. It became easier to borrow against the security of a Highland estate from the 1770s onwards. As the lenders became predominantly people and organisations outside the Highlands, there was a greater willingness to foreclose if the borrower defaulted. Combined with an astounding level of financial incompetence among the Highland elite, this ultimately forced the sale of the estates of many Highland landed families over the period 1770\u20131850. (The greatest number of sales of whole estates was toward the end of this period.)<ref name=\"Dodgshon\">{{cite book |last1=Dodgshon |first1=Robert A. |title=From Chiefs to Landlords: Social and Economic Change in the Western Highlands and Islands, c.1493\u20131820 |date=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0-7486-1034-0}}</ref>{{rp|105\u2013107}}{{r|Devine 1994|p=1\u201317}}{{r|Devine 2018|p=37-46, 65-73, 131-132}}\n\nThe Jacobite rebellion of 1745 gave a final period of importance to the ability of Highland clans to raise bodies of fighting men at short notice. With the defeat at Culloden, any enthusiasm for continued warfare disappeared and clan leaders returned to their transition to being commercial landlords. This was arguably accelerated by some of the punitive laws enacted after the rebellion.<ref>Stephen Conway, ''War, State, and Society in Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain and Ireland by Stephen Conway'' (2006), p. 139.</ref> These included the [[Heritable Jurisdictions Act]] of 1746, which removed judicial roles from clan chiefs and gave them to the Scottish law courts. [[Tom Devine|T. M. Devine]] warns against seeing a clear cause and effect relationship between the post-Culloden legislation and the collapse of clanship. He questions the basic effectiveness of the measures, quoting [[W. A. Speck]] who ascribes the pacification of the area more to \"a disinclination to rebel than to the government's repressive measures.\" Devine points out that social change in Gaeldom did not pick up until the 1760s and 1770s, as this coincided with the increased market pressures from the industrialising and urbanising Lowlands.{{r|Devine 1994|p=30-31}}\n\n41 properties belonging to rebels were forfeited to the Crown in the aftermath of the '45. The vast majority of these were sold by auction to pay creditors. 13 were retained and managed on behalf of the government between 1752 and 1784.\n\nThe changes by the Dukes of Argyll in the 1730s displaced many of the [[tacksmen]] in the area. From the 1770s onwards, this became a matter of policy throughout the Highlands. The restriction on subletting by tacksmen meant that landlords received all the rent paid by the actual farming tenants \u2013 thereby increasing their income. By the early part of the 19th century, the tacksman had become a rare component of Highland society. [[Tom Devine|T. M. Devine]] describes \"the displacement of this class as one of the clearest demonstrations of the death of the old Gaelic society.\"{{r|Devine 1994|p=34}} Many emigrated, leading parties of their tenants to North America. These tenants were from the better off part of Highland peasant society, and, together with the tacksmen, they took their capital and entrepreneurial energy to the New World, unwilling to participate in economic changes imposed by their landlords which often involved a loss of status for the tenant.{{r|Devine 1994|p=50}}<ref name=\"Devine 2006b\">{{cite book|last1=Devine|first1=T M|title=Clearance and Improvement: Land, Power and People in Scotland, 1700\u20131900|date=2006|publisher=Birlinn Ltd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-906566-23-4}}</ref>{{rp|173}}\n\n[[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural improvement]] was introduced across the Highlands over the relatively short period of 1760-1850. The evictions involved in this became known as the [[Highland clearances]]. There was regional variation. In the east and south of the Highlands, the old townships or ''{{lang|gd|bailtean}}'', which were farmed under the [[run rig]] system were replaced by larger enclosed farms, with fewer people holding leases and proportionately more of the population working as employees on these larger farms. (This was broadly similar to the situation in the Lowlands.) In the north and west, including the Hebrides, as land was taken out of run rig, [[Crofting]] communities were established. Much of this change involved establishing large pastoral sheep farms, with the old displaced tenants moving to new crofts in coastal areas or on poor quality land. Sheep farming was increasingly profitable at the end of the 18th century, so could pay substantially higher rents than the previous tenants. Particularly in the Hebrides, some crofting communities were established to work in the kelp industry. Others were engaged in fishing. Croft sizes were kept small, so that the occupiers were forced to seek employment to supplement what they could grow.{{r|Devine 1994|p=32-52}} This increased the number of seasonal migrant workers travelling to the Lowlands. The resulting connection with the Lowlands was highly influential on all aspects of Highland life, touching on income levels, social attitudes and language. Migrant working gave an advantage in speaking English, which came to be considered \"the language of work\".{{r|Devine 1994|p=135, 110\u2013117}}\n\nIn 1846 the [[Highland potato famine]] struck the crofting communities of the North and West Highlands. By 1850 the charitable relief effort was wound up, despite the continuing crop failure, and landlords, charities and the government resorted to encouraging emigration. The overall result was that almost 11,000 people were provided with \"assisted passages\" by their landlords between 1846 and 1856, with the greatest number travelling in 1851. A further 5,000 emigrated to Australia, through the [[Highland and Island Emigration Society]].  To this should be added an unknown, but significant number, who paid their own fares to emigrate, and a further unknown number assisted by the Colonial Land and Emigration commission.<ref name=\"Devine 1995\">{{cite book |last1=Devine |first1=T M |title=The Great Highland Famine: Hunger, Emigration and the Scottish Highlands in the Nineteenth Century |date=1995 |publisher=Birlinn Limited |location=Edinburgh |isbn=1-904607-42-X}}</ref>{{rp|201\u2013202,207,268}}{{r|Devine 2018|p=320}}{{r|Devine 1994|p=187-189}} This was out of a famine-affected population of about 200,000 people. Many of those who remained became even more involved in temporary migration for work in the Lowlands, both out of necessity during the famine and having become accustomed to working away by the time the famine ceased. Much longer periods were spent out of the Highlands \u2013 often for much of the year or more. One illustration of this migrant working was the estimated 30,000 men and women from the far west of the Gaelic speaking area who travelled to the east coast fishing ports for the herring fishing season \u2013 providing labour in an industry that grew by 60% between 1854 and 1884.{{r|Devine 2018|p=335-336}}\n\nThe clearances were followed by a period of even greater emigration from the Highlands, which continued (with a brief lull for the First World War) up to the start of the [[Great Depression]].{{r|Devine 2018|p=2}}\n\n===Enlightenment===\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adam Smith]], the father of modern economics.]]\n{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}\nHistorian [[Jonathan Israel]] argues that by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges.

The following \"Ten Years' Conflict\" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]] known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly in the Highlands and Islands, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.<ref name=Robb1990/> Chalmers's ideas shaped the breakaway group. He stressed a social vision that revived and preserved Scotland's communal traditions at a time of strain on the social fabric of the country. Chalmers's idealised small equalitarian, kirk-based, self-contained communities that recognised the individuality of their members and the need for co-operation.<ref>J. Brown Stewart, ''Thomas Chalmers and the godly Commonwealth in Scotland'' (1982)</ref> That vision also affected the mainstream Presbyterian churches, and by the 1870s it had been assimilated by the established Church of Scotland. Chalmers's ideals demonstrated that the church was concerned with the problems of urban society, and they represented a real attempt to overcome the social fragmentation that took place in industrial towns and cities.<ref>S. Mechie, ''The Church and Scottish social development, 1780\u20131870'' (1960).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century the major debates were between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals, who rejected a literal interpretation of the Bible. This resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterian Church]] in 1893.<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> There were, however, also moves towards reunion, beginning with the unification of some secessionist churches into the [[United Secession Church]] in 1820, which united with the Relief Church in 1847 to form the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]], which in turn joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]. The removal of legislation on lay patronage would allow the majority of the Free Church to rejoin Church of Scotland in 1929. The schisms left small denominations including the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland|Free Presbyterians]] and a remnant that had not merged in 1900 as the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church]].<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/>\n\n[[Catholic Emancipation]] in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, principally to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> Episcopalianism also revived in the 19th century as the issue of succession receded, becoming established as the [[Episcopal Church in Scotland]] in 1804, as an autonomous organisation in communion with the [[Church of England]].<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> [[Baptist Union of Scotland|Baptist]], [[Congregational Union of Scotland|Congregationalist]] and [[Methodist]] churches had appeared in Scotland in the 18th century, but did not begin significant growth until the 19th century,<ref name=Koch2006p416-7/> partly because more radical and evangelical traditions already existed within the Church of Scotland and the free churches.

After two commissions of enquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889, the curriculum and system of graduation were reformed to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. Entrance examinations equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered 3-year ordinary and 4-year honours degrees and separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum.<ref name=Anderson2003p224>R.

The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the numbers fell, particularly among women. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.<ref>C.
