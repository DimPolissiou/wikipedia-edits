He is known for such pieces as ''[[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]]''. He is often called \"the father of classical guitar\" and is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Recuerdos de la Alhambra.ogg|title=\"Recuerdos de la Alhambra\"|description=Performed by Carlo Alberto Boni}}\nT\u00e1rrega was born on 21 November 1852, in [[Villarreal]], [[Province of Castell\u00f3n]], Spain. It is said that Francisco's father played [[flamenco]] and several other music styles on his guitar; when his father was away working as a watchman at the Convent of San Pascual, Francisco would take his father's guitar and attempt to make the beautiful sounds he had heard. Francisco's nickname as a child was \"Quiquet\".\n\nAs a child, he ran away from his nanny and fell into an irrigation channel and injured his eyes. Fearing that his son might lose his sight completely, his father moved the family to [[Castell\u00f3n de la Plana]] to attend music classes because as a musician he would be able to earn a living, even if blind. Both his first music teachers, Eugeni Ruiz and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez, were blind.\n\nIn 1862, concert guitarist [[Juli\u00e1n Arcas]], on tour in Castell\u00f3n, heard the young T\u00e1rrega play and advised T\u00e1rrega's father to allow Francisco to come to [[Barcelona]] to study with him. T\u00e1rrega's father agreed, but insisted that his son take [[piano]] lessons as well. The guitar was viewed as an instrument to accompany singers, while the piano was quite popular throughout Europe. However, T\u00e1rrega had to stop his lessons shortly after, when Arcas left for a concert tour abroad. Although T\u00e1rrega was only ten years old, he ran away and tried to start a musical career on his own by playing in coffee houses and restaurants in Barcelona. He was soon found and brought back to his father, who had to make great sacrifices to advance his son's musical education.\n\nThree years later, in 1865, he ran away again, this time to [[Valencia]] where he joined a gang of [[Romani people|gypsies]]. His father looked for him and brought him back home once more, but he ran away a third time, again to Valencia. By his early teens, T\u00e1rrega was proficient on both the piano and the guitar. For a time, he played with other musicians at local engagements to earn money, but eventually he returned home to help his family.\n[[File:Francisco tarrega.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Monument of T\u00e1rrega in Villarreal]]\n\nT\u00e1rrega entered the [[Madrid]] [[Music school|conservatory]] in 1874, under the sponsorship of a wealthy merchant named Antonio Canesa. He had brought along with him a recently purchased guitar, made in [[Seville]] by [[Antonio de Torres]]. Its superior sonic qualities inspired him both in his playing and in his view of the instrument's compositional potential. At the conservatory, T\u00e1rrega studied composition under [[Emilio Arrieta]] who convinced him to focus on guitar and abandon the idea of a career with the piano.\n\nBy the end of the 1870s, T\u00e1rrega was teaching the guitar ([[Emilio Pujol]], [[Miguel Llobet]], and [[Daniel Fortea]] were pupils of his) and giving regular concerts. T\u00e1rrega received much acclaim for his playing and began traveling to other areas of Spain to perform. By this time he was composing his first works for guitar, which he played in addition to works of other composers.\n\nDuring the winter of 1880, T\u00e1rrega replaced his friend Luis de Soria, in a concert in [[Novelda]], [[Alicante]], where, after the concert, an important man in town asked the artist to listen to his daughter, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rizo, who was learning to play guitar. Soon they were engaged.\n\nIn 1881, T\u00e1rrega played in the Opera Theatre in Lyon and then the [[Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe|Paris Odeon]], in the bicentenary of the death of [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]]. He also played in London, but he liked neither the language nor the weather. There is a story about his visit to England. After a concert, some people saw that the musician was in low spirits. \"What is the matter, maestro?\" they asked him. \"Do you miss home? Your family, perhaps?\" They advised him to capture that moment of sadness in his music. Thus he conceived the theme of one of his most memorable works, ''[[L\u00e1grima (T\u00e1rrega)|L\u00e1grima]]'' (literally meaning teardrop). After playing in London he came back to Novelda for his wedding. At Christmas 1882, T\u00e1rrega married Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rizo.\n\nTo enlarge his guitar repertory and, no doubt, to make use of his considerable knowledge of keyboard music, he soon began transcribing piano works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and others. T\u00e1rrega and his wife moved to Madrid, gaining their living by teaching privately and playing concerts, but after the death of an infant daughter during the winter, Maria Josefa de los Angeles T\u00e1rrega Rizo, they settled permanently in Barcelona in 1885. Among his friends in Barcelona were [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Enrique Granados]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Turina]] and [[Pablo Casals]].\n[[File:Vicent Castell 001.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Vicente Castell]] (1904)]]\nFrancisco T\u00e1rrega and Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (Mar\u00eda Josefa) Rizo had three more children: Paquito (Francisco), Maria Rosatia (Mar\u00eda Rosalia) (best known as Marieta) and Concepci\u00f3n. On a concert tour in Valencia shortly afterward, T\u00e1rrega met a wealthy widow, Conxa Martinez, who became a valuable patron to him. She allowed him and his family use of a house in Barcelona, where he would write the bulk of his most popular works. Later she took him to [[Granada]], where the guitarist conceived the theme for ''[[Recuerdos de la Alhambra]]'', which he composed on his return and dedicated to his friend Alfred Cottin, a Frenchman who had arranged his Paris concerts.\n\nFrom the later 1880s up to 1903, T\u00e1rrega continued composing, but limited his concerts to Spain. In 1900, T\u00e1rrega visited [[Algiers]], where he heard a repetitive rhythm played on an Arabian drum. The following morning he composed ''Danza Mora'' based on that rhythm. In about 1902, he cut his fingernails and created a sound that would become typical of those guitarists associated with his school. The following year he went on tour to Italy, giving highly successful concerts in Rome, Naples, and Milan.\n\nIn January 1906, he was afflicted with paralysis on his right side, and though he would eventually return to the concert stage, he never completely recovered. He finished his last work, ''[[Oremus (T\u00e1rrega)|Oremus]]'', on 2 December 1909. He died in Barcelona thirteen days later, on 15 December, at the age of 57.\n\n==Musical style==\nAs a composer T\u00e1rrega was conservative, with a style similar to the general trends of the second half of the 19th century. A virtuoso on his instrument, he was known as the \"[[Pablo de Sarasate|Sarasate]] of the guitar\".\n\nT\u00e1rrega is considered to have laid the foundations for 20th century classical guitar and for increasing interest in the guitar as a recital instrument. T\u00e1rrega preferred small intimate performances over the concert stage.\n\n== Compositions==\n[[File:Tarrega music1.jpg|thumb|upright|Sheet music]]\n{{See also|List of compositions by Francisco T\u00e1rrega}}\nFrancisco T\u00e1rrega composed 78 original scores and 120 transcriptions \u2013 mostly for his own use.\n\nAs with several of his Spanish contemporaries, such as his friend [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], he had an interest in combining the prevailing Romantic trend in classical music with Spanish folk elements, and transcribed several of Alb\u00e9niz's piano pieces. The contemporary guitarist and composer [[Angelo Gilardino]] has written that T\u00e1rrega's 9 ''Preludios'' are \"... the deepest musical thought of T\u00e1rrega in the most concentrated form.\"\n\nHe is also the composer of ''Gran Vals'', an excerpt of which was used in the iconic [[Nokia tune|Nokia ringtone]].\n\n==Guitars==\nThe guitars used by T\u00e1rrega include:\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}\n\n*[[Antonio Torres Jurado|Torres]], FE 17 (1864) \u2013 This is the guitar that was given to T\u00e1rrega by Torres personally after hearing him play.\n*Torres, SE 49 (1883)\n*Torres, SE 114 (1888); in the collection of Sheldon Urlik<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/94467669@N00/2758493038/in/set-72157606696587125/ Photo of a Torres guitar used by T\u00e1rrega]</ref><ref>[http://www.luth.org/convention/2004/conv04_20.JPG Photo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126084732/http://luth.org/convention/2004/conv04_20.JPG |date=26 November 2010 }}: \"Jeff Elliott (left) restored these important guitars by Gonzalez and Torres.

The band developed a cult following in Canada, with their [[Barenaked Ladies (EP)|self-titled 1991 cassette]] becoming the first independent release to be certified gold in Canada. They reached mainstream success in Canada when their debut with Reprise Records, ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]'', featuring the singles \"[[If I Had $1000000]]\" and \"[[Brian Wilson (song)|Brian Wilson]]\", was released in 1992. The band subsequently translated this into [[United States|U.S.]] success beginning with versions of \"[[Brian Wilson]]\" and \"[[The Old Apartment]]\" off their 1996 live album ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'' followed by their 1998 fourth studio album ''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]'' which was ultimately their breakout success.

The band broke up, and he forgot about the gig. When Robertson received a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to \"Barenaked Ladies\", recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/><ref name=\"Talk to the Hand\"/><ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> The two played the show on October 1, 1988,<ref name=\"Star89\">{{cite news | title=We finally get date with Barenaked Ladies | last = Potter | first = Mitch | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date= November 24, 1989}} \"But they finally managed a first-ever rehearsal the morning of Oct. 1, 1988, about ''five hours'' before making a stage debut at a Nathan Phillips Square benefit concert.\"</ref> but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that they both knew. The show went well, and they were invited to open a show for another well-known local band, [[The Razorbacks]], at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] the coming weekend. They set up three more rehearsals, and again missed them all; they proceeded to improvise their set once again. These acts would set a precedent for an element of Barenaked Ladies concerts, which still almost always contain some improvised raps or songs, as well as general improvised banter.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/><ref name=\"Talk to the Hand\"/><ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/>\n\n[[File:StevenPageMassey.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Co-founder Steven Page in 2005]]\nPage and Robertson continued performing and also began writing songs together. The band's first tape, ''[[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Buck Naked|Buck Naked]]'' (1989), was made using a four-track recorder<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]], to whom they give credit for exposing them to the idea of comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> One night, in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited their friends, brothers [[Andy Creeggan]] (percussion) and [[Jim Creeggan]] (bass), whom they knew from music camp,<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/> to play with them at a Christmas time club show. [[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Barenaked Lunch|''Barenaked Lunch'' (a.k.a. ''The Pink Tape'')]] was released in 1990 and featured the two new band members. The tape had problems, however, as it was mastered incorrectly and played too fast.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/>\n\n[[File:JimCreeggan1.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Jim Creeggan in 2008]]\nAfter six months, Andy Creeggan went on a student exchange trip to South America, leaving the band without a percussionist. While playing at a [[busking|buskers]]' festival in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], in the summer of 1990, they met drummer [[Tyler Stewart]], who took over the position.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> While Creeggan was gone, the band gained some attention when they were winners at the 1990 [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]] Achievement Awards.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> They gained further attention when they squeezed into a small \"[[Speakers' Corner (television series)|Speaker's Corner]]\" video booth in Toronto, and performed \"[[Be My Yoko Ono]]\".<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> The clip quickly became popular with viewers, and noticeably increased the band's fanbase. Andy Creeggan returned in early 1991 to find that Stewart had taken over the percussion role. This change caused some concern for him, and he then moved more toward keyboards, though he still played percussion (usually [[congas]]) on some songs. Soon after, the band embarked upon their first full tour of Canada.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/>\n\n===Early Canadian success (1991\u20131992)===\nThe full band's first commercial release was 1991's ''[[The Yellow Tape]]''. It was a demo tape originally created for the band's performance at [[South by Southwest]] and was the first recording to feature all five members.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/> They spent between $2,000 and $3,000 on it, and sent copies to all the labels in Canada; all of them refused.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> The band turned to sell them off the stage and wound up selling a lot of them. Word of mouth spread and people began asking for the tape in local stores. The stores began asking the band for copies of the tape, and the demo tape became a commercial release.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> Sales began to snowball based merely on word of mouth and their live shows.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> Page's father, Victor, created the independent label Page Publications to handle the cassette's manufacturing and distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Paul|title=Barenaked Ladies: Public Stunts, Private Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTRuJKlUoHcC&pg=PP1|date=October 2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-3835-9}}</ref> (After the band signed to a major label, Page Publications remained in operation, later releasing albums by artists such as [[The Lowest of the Low]], [[Leslie Spit Treeo]], [[Annette Ducharme]], [[David Gogo]] and [[Bodega (Canadian band)|Bodega]].)\n\nDuring this era, the band also garnered radio airplay with a live cover of [[Dean Friedman]]'s \"I'm in Love with a McDonald's Girl\", which included a rap break featuring lyrics from [[Beastie Boys]]' \"[[Hey Ladies]]\".<ref>\"Goofiness is its own reward for boys from the 'burbs\".

The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the ''Yellow Tape'' exploded \u2014 by February 1992, it was outselling even [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'', [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[We Can't Dance]]'' and [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' in some downtown Toronto record stores.<ref>\"Ladies don't have record deal yet\".

It benefited from the fact that a number of songs on the album (including the latter three) had been live favourites for a while and had been recorded on past releases like ''The Yellow Tape''. While the band was doing remarkably well in Canada, they found that it translated into little success in the United States.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JimCreeggan2008.png|thumb|Left|Jim Creeggan in 2008]] -->\n\nBNL's second album, ''[[Maybe You Should Drive]]'', released in 1994,<ref name=\"MMMBio\"/> fared considerably less well with the Canadian public.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> They tried touring the United States, but the tour was a failure and ended up losing money despite an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Before the next release, Andy Creeggan decided to leave the band. He had become disillusioned with the direction of the band,<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> and was not comfortable with the fame the group had attained.<ref name=\"MMMBio\"/> According to Page, he had considered leaving as early as the rehearsals for the ''Drive'' album; The rest of the band convinced him to stay to record that album, and for the subsequent touring. Also, Creeggan wanted to attend [[McGill University]] to study music further.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/32/13/kaleidoscope|title=Kaleidoscope|website=Mcgill.ca|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> Tyler Stewart has also suggested that Creeggan had never fully accepted his replacement by Stewart as a percussionist.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> Andy Creeggan's departure came during a time in which members of the band were starting to become sick of each other, with Page and Robertson rarely speaking to one another. Stewart cites the departure as worsening the situation. Page also began struggling with both alcohol abuse and depression.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/><ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> In an attempt to correct the band's downward slide, they signed with [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]] and [[Nettwerk]] as their management.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/>\n\nThe band released ''[[Born on a Pirate Ship]]'' as a quartet in 1996.<ref name = \"Barelaked Nadies\"/> The album received two large boosts from the inclusion of the song \"[[Shoe Box]]\" on the ''[[Friends]]'' soundtrack<ref name = \"Barelaked Nadies\"/> and from the [[Jason Priestley]]-directed video for \"[[The Old Apartment]]\", which got notable American airplay<ref name = \"Barelaked Nadies\"/> and while the album had stronger sales than ''Maybe You Should Drive'', the album still did not match the success of \"Gordon\".<ref name=\"MMMBio\"/> The Ladies appeared as the guest band on an episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' (\"Spring Breakdown\" original airdate: April 2, 1997), immediately preceding their 1997 tour; they performed \"The Old Apartment,\" \"Life, In A Nutshell,\" and \"Brian Wilson\" at the Peach Pit After Dark night club. Tyler Stewart invited his friend [[Kevin Hearn]] to replace Andy Creeggan as a keyboardist for the tour; Hearn ultimately joined the band full-time. The group also had a cameo in the Canadian film ''[[The Wrong Guy]]'' with Dave Foley in 1997. They performed the song \"Gangster Girl\" as police officers in an alley on their break.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/><ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/>\n\nFrom two dates on the ''Born on a Pirate Ship'' tour during 1996, BNL recorded and released a live album called ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', which had a modest radio hit in the United States with \"Brian Wilson.\" The album became the band's first gold record in the United States, and the success of \"Brian Wilson\", coupled with the success of \"The Old Apartment\", led to a new situation for the band.

If you change the section title, please change the links-->\nBarenaked Ladies has often attempted to use new technologies to promote themselves and their music. They were among the early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an \"Interactive Press Kit\" on a 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]] for ''Maybe You Should Drive'' in 1994, which earned them a [[MuchMusic Video Award]]. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs (\"Be My Yoko Ono\" and \"Alternative Girlfriend\") for inclusion on their greatest hits CD ''[[Disc One]]'' (though polling was nearly tied and both songs were included).\n\nBeginning in April 2003, the band started a [[blog]] on its website to keep fans updated personally, coinciding with the band's return to the studio for ''Everything to Everyone''. During a subsequent studio session, for ''Barenaked Ladies Are Me'', Ed Robertson began a [[podcast]] in addition to the blog, which ran from February to August 2006 (with a series of four videos added in early 2007 with highlights from the [[#Ships and Dip cruises|band's first cruise]]).\n\nThe band has adopted many of the current online social networking sites, including accounts on [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]]. The Twitter feed has been integrated into the band's website, and it also typically announces new blog posts with a link. These accounts have been used for contests and to debut new tracks. Different band members have also had individual accounts on these sites at times.\n\nBarenaked Ladies has sold recordings of almost all of its live concerts since early 2004. Initially, shows were sold on [[CD-R]] or as [[MP3]] downloads. By the end of 2004, lossless [[FLAC]] files were also offered. Professionally printed copies of some concerts were later offered through some isolated record stores, and some shows have been added to the [[iTunes Music Store]]s and other digital retailers.\n\nThe band was praised for a unique use of [[USB flash drive]] technology. The group offered its 2004 ''Barenaked For the Holidays'' album on a customized flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks, and photos and videos from the studio sessions for the album. The band used a 128 MB USB flash drive, limiting the bitrate of the music included. The group described the product as a test of the technology and the market for that technology. It subsequently released ''Are Me'' in the USB format as well (on a 256 MB flash drive). The band also incorporated the technology into its live music sales, offering fans a copy of concerts in MP3 format on a USB stick at the merchandise booth directly after the show.\n\nIn 2009 the band took part in an interactive documentary series, ''[[City Sonic]]''. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, includes Tyler Stewart reflecting on his memories of the (now closed) Ultrasound Showbar. The films were accompanied by an [[iPhone]] application, which uses [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology to unlock more videos when the user is close to the specific location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |title=citysonic.tv |website=Citysonic.tv |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104210212/http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the Barenaked Ladies participated in what was billed as the \"first space-to-earth musical collaboration\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAnfi8WpVE |title= Chris Hadfield and Barenaked Ladies: I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing) |publisher=CBC Music |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> involving the band and [[Chris Hadfield]], a Canadian astronaut and commander of the [[International Space Station]], along with the Wexford Gleeks, a Canadian student choir. The group, Hadfield and the choir performed a song \"I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing)\" that was commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Canadian Space Agency]].\n\n==Ships and Dip cruises==\nFollowing a lead from other artists, the band held a fan cruise called \"Ships and Dip\", January 15\u201319, 2007. Other artists who joined the Ladies included side projects [[The Brothers Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]] and [[The Vanity Project]], as well as friends of the band, [[Guster]], [[Jason Plumb]], [[The New Odds]], and others. The ship also featured comedy from band friends [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] and [[Harland Williams]].\n\nThe success of the cruise led to a second cruise, incongruously named \"Ships and Dip III\", held January 27 \u2013 February 1, 2008. Many of the same artists were joined by newcomers such as [[Great Big Sea]], who were a headlining performer. The third annual cruise, \"Ships and Dip V\", sailed February 1\u20136, 2009, again featuring some returning and some new artists, adding [[Sarah McLachlan]] as an opening act for each of the band's three main theatre shows. Other new performers included [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], [[Luke Doucet]], [[The Mountain Goats]] and [[The Weakerthans]]. Page left the band shortly after Ships and Dip V, and his performances onboard are his last known performances with the band.\n\nThe fourth Ships and Dip cruise (dubbed \"Ships and Dip 4\", breaking with the odd-numbered naming convention of the first three cruises) sailed February 6\u201311, 2011 on the Norwegian Dawn from Miami, Florida. Ships and Dip 4 was the first (and thus far, only) Ships and Dip cruise since the departure of Steven Page.\n\nThe artists on the Ships and Dip cruises sailed on board with the rest of the passengers for the duration of the cruises; this contrasted some other music cruises at the time on which the artist or artists travelled separately to one of the cruise destinations and performed there, or joined the cruise for only a portion of the trip. Band members enjoyed other artists' shows and most of the ship's amenities freely with the other guests. Barenaked Ladies performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly sat in with other artists at their shows.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Infobox Musician Awards\n| name = Barenaked Ladies\n| image = Barenaked Ladies miming golf.jpg\n| caption = From left to right: Hearn, Stewart, Creeggan, and Robertson watch Page mime golfing during an ad lib in 2004.\n| wins = 14\n| nominations = 31\n| BillboardW = 2\n| BillboardN = 2\n| GrammyN = 2\n| JunoW = 8\n| JunoN = 18\n| MTVVideoN = 1\n| MuchMusicW = 4\n| MuchMusicN = 7\n| WorldW = 1\n| WorldN = 1\n}}\nIn 1993, Barenaked Ladies were nominated for their first four [[Juno Awards]]: Canadian Entertainer of the Year, Album of the year for ''Gordon'', Single of the Year for ''Enid'', and Group of the year, which was their only win.

An updated version of the biography was released in 2003 in the United States with a different cover, several corrections, and additional information about ''Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits'' and ''Everything to Everyone'', which were released after the initial printing.\n\n===Canadian Music Creators Coalition===\nIn May 2006, Barenaked Ladies, along with other prominent Canadian musicians, formed the [[Canadian Music Creators Coalition]] in response to plans by the Canadian government to revisit and update copyright laws. Steven Page has acted as a conduit between the CMCC and the press, urging the government to focus on the Canadian cultural scene. Page has said the formation of the CMCC was in response to what he believes is the wrong direction taken by the [[RIAA]] and the major labels, by suing fans for filesharing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricsky.net/?p=145|title=Steven Page on the Canadian Music Creators Coalition - Electric Sky|website=Electricsky.net|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Barenaked Planet===\nThe band has also become a proponent of environmentalism, following from Page's passion for greening (he is himself a board member of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Canada]]). The group began bringing an \"[[eco-village]]\" organized by the [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]] organization on their 2004 Au Naturale tour. The band has since partnered with Reverb to form the \"Barenaked Planet\" project, which is the group's label for their project to progressively \"green\" their touring. Efforts the band have made include ensuring backstage materials are recycled, using [[biodiesel]] in their tour vehicles (B20 as of December 2006), and [[carbon offset|offsetting carbon emissions]] with wind power. This includes both band-sponsored offsets for their own emissions, as well as having volunteers sell \"Barenaked Planet\" stickers to concertgoers with the money going to offset their drives to the venues.<ref name=\"GillDec28\">{{cite video\n  | people = [[Steven Page|Page, Steven]] & [[Gill Deacon|Deacon, Gill]] (Interviewer/Host)\n  | title = The Gill Deacon Show\n  | medium = TV-series\n  | publisher = [[CBC Television]]\n  | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n  | date = December 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours ice cream===\nIn May 2009, BNL partnered with American ice cream company [[Ben & Jerry's]] to create the flavour If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours. Named after the song \"[[If I Had $1000000]]\", the confection consists of vanilla and chocolate ice cream, peanut butter cups, chocolate-coated toffee chunks, white chocolate chunks and chocolate-coated almonds. In the United States, this ice cream flavour is sold under the name Everything But The....\n\nBNL is the first Canadian band to receive their own ice cream flavour, following in the footsteps of other band-themed Ben & Jerry's flavours such as Cherry Garcia ([[Jerry Garcia]]), One Sweet Whirled and Magic Brownies ([[Dave Matthews Band]]) and Phish Food ([[Phish]]). All royalties from the sale of If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours are donated to the ABC Canada Literacy Foundation, a Toronto-based organization that promotes reading to children at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html |title=newswire.ca |website=Newswire.ca |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110609190558/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2009/12/c2115.html| archivedate= June 9, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marcus |first=Bianca |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |title=chartattack.com |website=Chartattack.com |date=May 12, 2009 |accessdate=2011-06-06 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826153041/http://www.chartattack.com/news/69662/ice-cream-heals-bnl-wounds |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Artists Against Racism===\nBNL are a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them in the past on awareness campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artistsagainstracism.org/radio-2/|title=Radio - Artists Against Racism|website=Artistsagaistrecism.org|accessdate=November 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''WE Charity''' \n\nBNL have made several appearances during [[WE Day]] events, performing in front of thousands of teenagers, empowering the young students to get involved in their communities and to promote social activity through [[WE Charity|WE charity]]'s work. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianliving.com/life-and-relationships/community-and-current-events/article/highlights-from-we-day-toronto-and-we-day-family|title=Highlights from WE Day Toronto and WE Day Family|last=Dziedzic|first=Sarah|date=|website=Canadian Living|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/samantha-kempjackson/we-day-2013_b_3974659.html|title=We Day: An Inspiration For Change|date=2013-09-23|website=HuffPost Canada|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bc.ctvnews.ca/we-day-brings-rock-star-cred-to-social-activism-1.563573|title=We Day brings rock-star cred to social activism|last=Wintonyk|first=Darcy|date=2010-10-15|website=British Columbia|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n'''Rock CAN Rol'''\n\nBNL have supported hunger relief organization Rock Can Rol and together with their fans have helped feed men, women and children in need.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jethrotull.proboards.com/thread/1331/musicians-rock-roll-hungry|title=Musicians rock CAN roll For the Hungry {{!}} The Jethro Tull Forum|website=jethrotull.proboards.com|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Side projects==\nTyler Stewart, Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn and Ed Robertson all have past or present side projects during their time off from BNL.

Andy Creeggan also has several solo albums with the most recent one released in 2010.<ref name=\"BrosCreeg\"/>\n\nSince 1995, Kevin Hearn has released four albums as the frontman of [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]], and three others with solo billing (with members of Thin Buckle as well as other musicians backing him).

He has also released an album of love songs as \"The Cousins\" in 2004 with his cousin, comedian [[Harland Williams]].\n\nRobertson joined a supergroup called [[Yukon Kornelius]] in 2008 with [[Dave Matthews Band]] bass player [[Stefan Lessard]], singer/guitarist [[Adam Gardner]] of [[Guster]], and drummer Eric Fawcett of [[Spymob]].

Special guests usually join Yukon Kornelius during their shows, including [[Dee Snider]] of [[Twisted Sister]], [[Carl Bell (musician)|Carl Bell]] (formerly of [[Fuel (band)|Fuel]]), Tyler Stewart, and other members of the Dave Matthews Band. Robertson also hosted three seasons of the 2006 television program called ''Ed's Up'' for OLN Canada in which he would fly his own plane to various locations and experience and publicize a variety of interesting occupations.\n\nFormer member Steven Page had a side project called [[The Vanity Project]]. The first self-titled album was written mostly with long-time collaborator [[Stephen Duffy]]. In the wake of a band decision to try to keep songwriting amongst its then-five members, Page said that the project was an opportunity for him to write with non-BNL writers. He indicated that a future release might including other writers and not necessarily Duffy. However, Page did not record a second Vanity Project album before his departure from Barenaked Ladies and has released his post-BNL works in his own name. Page has also hosted a season of the reality television series ''[[The Illegal Eater]]'', which features Page travelling to showcase food and drink experiences that are in some way taboo, illicit or outright illegal.\n\nAlso, band members (both individually and together) have often collaborated with other artists, such as making guest appearances on their albums, performing live, or co-writing songs with them.\n\nIn February 2019 all four band members joined Canadian rock musician [[Kim Mitchell]] in recording a rework of Mitchell's former band [[Max Webster]] song [[Diamonds Diamonds]] from their 1977 album\n\"High Class In Borrowed Shoes\" A video of the collaboration was also released on [[YouTube]].\n\n==Reception==\nIn December 2008, former member of [[The Beatles]], [[Paul McCartney]], was reportedly asked by a session musician which bands he enjoys in the current music scene. The response was the Barenaked Ladies: \"Their harmonies are right on. They could outsing us any day of the week. I don't think [[John Lennon|John]] and myself ever had the sort of range they do.\" McCartney added that he would not mind recording with the band in the future.<ref name=\"http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four/\">{{cite web |url=http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |title=IUC Exclusive: Paul McCartney says Barenaked Ladies sing Much better than Fab Four; Would Consider Joining Them |website=Ianundercover.com |accessdate=2009-05-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525162258/http://ianundercover.com/2008/12/13/iuc-paul-mccartney-says-barenaked-ladies-sing-much-better-than-fab-four |archivedate=May 25, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, notable Ontarian musical historians Liam Coholan, Patrick Murphy and Jon \"The Don\" Dilario acknowledge in their latest Canadian music history issue that \"BNL was one of the most impactful bands when it comes to discussing the development of Canadian society in the 21st century.\"<ref>{{cite document|title=Canadian Music History Issue #412|id={{ProQuest|1772089760}}}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Barenaked Ladies discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''[[Gordon (album)|''Gordon'']]'' (1992)\n*''[[Maybe You Should Drive]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Born on a Pirate Ship]]'' (1996)\n*''[[Stunt (album)|Stunt]]'' (1998)\n*''[[Maroon (Barenaked Ladies album)|Maroon]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Everything to Everyone]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Barenaked for the Holidays]]'' (2004)\n*''[[As You Like It (Barenaked Ladies album)|As You Like It]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Barenaked Ladies Are Me]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Barenaked Ladies Are Men]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Snacktime!]]'' (2008)\n*''[[All in Good Time (Barenaked Ladies album)|All in Good Time]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Grinning Streak]]'' (2013)\n*''[[Silverball (Barenaked Ladies album)|Silverball]]'' (2015)\n*''[[Ladies and Gentlemen: Barenaked Ladies and The Persuasions]]'' (2017)\n*''[[Fake Nudes]]'' (2017)\n\n==Video releases==\n* ''[[Barenaked in America]]''\n* ''Too Little Too Late''\n* ''[[Barelaked Nadies]]''\n* ''The Barenaked Truth''\n* ''[[Talk to the Hand|Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q371997|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no|s=no|wikt=no}}\n*{{Official site}}\n*{{youtube|user=bnlmusic|suffix='}}\n\n{{Barenaked Ladies|state=expanded}}\n{{Juno Award for Album of the Year (2000-present)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[Category:Barenaked Ladies| ]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Conservatory of Music]]\n[[Category:Canadian alternative rock groups]]\n[[Category:Canadian buskers]]\n[[Category:Sire Records artists]]\n[[Category:Canadian folk rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Toronto]]\n[[Category:Juno Award for Single of the Year winners]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Geek rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical quartets]]\n[[Category:Juno Award for Album of the Year winners]]\n[[Category:Juno Award for Children's Album of the Year winners]]\n[[Category:Juno Award for Group of the Year winners]]\n[[Category:World Music Awards winners]]\n[[Category:Juno Award for Pop Album of the Year winners]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian band}}\n{{Infobox musical artist|<!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name             = Barenaked Ladies\n| image            = BNakedLadiesJonesBeach.jpg\n| caption          = Barenaked Ladies, August 2012\n| image_size       = 250px\n| landscape        = yes\n| background       = group_or_band\n| alias            = \n| origin           = [[Scarborough, Ontario]], Canada\n| genre            = {{flatlist|\n <!-- should not be changed or added to without discussion on talk page-->\n* [[Alternative rock]]\n* [[jangle pop]]\n* [[college rock]]\n* [[folk rock]]\n* [[pop rock]]\n* [[comedy rock]]\n& [[geek rock]]<ref name=\"Weisbard\">{{cite magazine|title=Geek Love|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]|date=December 2000|first=Eric|last=Weisbard|pages=158\u2013162}}</ref><ref name=\"Cantrell\">{{cite book|chapter='A Very Subtle Joke': T.

The band broke up, and he forgot about the gig. When Robertson received a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to \"Barenaked Ladies\", recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/><ref name=\"Talk to the Hand\"/><ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> The two played the show on October 1, 1988,<ref name=\"Star89\">{{cite news | title=We finally get date with Barenaked Ladies | last = Potter | first = Mitch | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date= November 24, 1989}} \"But they finally managed a first-ever rehearsal the morning of Oct. 1, 1988, about ''five hours'' before making a stage debut at a Nathan Phillips Square benefit concert.\"</ref> but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that they both knew. The show went well, and they were invited to open a show for another well-known local band, [[The Razorbacks]], at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] the coming weekend. They set up three more rehearsals, and again missed them all; they proceeded to improvise their set once again. These acts would set a precedent for an element of Barenaked Ladies concerts, which still almost always contain some improvised raps or songs, as well as general improvised banter.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/><ref name=\"Talk to the Hand\"/><ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/>\n\n[[File:StevenPageMassey.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Co-founder Steven Page in 2005]]\nPage and Robertson continued performing and also began writing songs together. The band's first tape, ''[[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Buck Naked|Buck Naked]]'' (1989), was made using a four-track recorder<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> in basements and bedrooms. The pair became followers of comedy group [[Corky and the Juice Pigs]], to whom they give credit for exposing them to the idea of comedic stage presence. Page and Robertson presented the group with their tape and were invited to open for the Juice Pigs on their cross-Canada tour.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> One night, in Toronto, Page and Robertson invited their friends, brothers [[Andy Creeggan]] (percussion) and [[Jim Creeggan]] (bass), whom they knew from music camp,<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/> to play with them at a Christmas time club show. [[Barenaked Ladies demo tapes#Barenaked Lunch|''Barenaked Lunch'' (a.k.a. ''The Pink Tape'')]] was released in 1990 and featured the two new band members. The tape had problems, however, as it was mastered incorrectly and played too fast.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/>\n\n[[File:JimCreeggan1.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Jim Creeggan in 2008]]\nAfter six months, Andy Creeggan went on a student exchange trip to South America, leaving the band without a percussionist. While playing at a [[busking|buskers]]' festival in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], in the summer of 1990, they met drummer [[Tyler Stewart]], who took over the position.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> While Creeggan was gone, the band gained some attention when they were winners at the 1990 [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]] Achievement Awards.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> They gained further attention when they squeezed into a small \"[[Speakers' Corner (television series)|Speaker's Corner]]\" video booth in Toronto, and performed \"[[Be My Yoko Ono]]\".<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/> The clip quickly became popular with viewers, and noticeably increased the band's fanbase. Andy Creeggan returned in early 1991 to find that Stewart had taken over the percussion role. This change caused some concern for him, and he then moved more toward keyboards, though he still played percussion (usually [[congas]]) on some songs. Soon after, the band embarked upon their first full tour of Canada.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/>\n\n===Early Canadian success (1991\u20131992)===\nThe full band's first commercial release was 1991's ''[[The Yellow Tape]]''. It was a demo tape originally created for the band's performance at [[South by Southwest]] and was the first recording to feature all five members.<ref name=\"Barenaked Truth bonus\"/> They spent between $2,000 and $3,000 on it, and sent copies to all the labels in Canada; all of them refused.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> The band turned to sell them off the stage and wound up selling a lot of them. Word of mouth spread and people began asking for the tape in local stores. The stores began asking the band for copies of the tape, and the demo tape became a commercial release.<ref name=\"Distinguished Artists\"/> Sales began to snowball based merely on word of mouth and their live shows.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/> Page's father, Victor, created the independent label Page Publications to handle the cassette's manufacturing and distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Paul|title=Barenaked Ladies: Public Stunts, Private Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTRuJKlUoHcC&pg=PP1|date=October 2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-3835-9}}</ref> (After the band signed to a major label, Page Publications remained in operation, later releasing albums by artists such as [[The Lowest of the Low]], [[Leslie Spit Treeo]], [[Annette Ducharme]], [[David Gogo]] and [[Bodega (Canadian band)|Bodega]].)\n\nDuring this era, the band also garnered radio airplay with a live cover of [[Dean Friedman]]'s \"I'm in Love with a McDonald's Girl\", which included a rap break featuring lyrics from [[Beastie Boys]]' \"[[Hey Ladies]]\".<ref>\"Goofiness is its own reward for boys from the 'burbs\".

Tyler Stewart invited his friend [[Kevin Hearn]] to replace Andy Creeggan as a keyboardist for the tour; Hearn ultimately joined the band full-time. The group also had a cameo in the Canadian film ''[[The Wrong Guy]]'' with Dave Foley in 1997. They performed the song \"Gangster Girl\" as police officers in an alley on their break.<ref name=\"Behind the Music\"/><ref name=\"Barenaked Truth\"/>\n\nFrom two dates on the ''Born on a Pirate Ship'' tour during 1996, BNL recorded and released a live album called ''[[Rock Spectacle]]'', which had a modest radio hit in the United States with \"Brian Wilson.\" The album became the band's first gold record in the United States, and the success of \"Brian Wilson\", coupled with the success of \"The Old Apartment\", led to a new situation for the band.

''Stunt'' reached No. 3 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and No. 9 in Canada.

The album was their weakest seller in years, with a short chart life. With the release, the band fulfilled their contract with [[Reprise Records]], with whom they did not re-sign. This made the group independent for the first time since 1992 (though they retained a distribution relationship with [[Warner Bros. Records]]).

If you change the section title, please change the links-->\nBarenaked Ladies has often attempted to use new technologies to promote themselves and their music. They were among the early adopters of computers for promotion when they released an \"Interactive Press Kit\" on a 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]] for ''Maybe You Should Drive'' in 1994, which earned them a [[MuchMusic Video Award]]. They used their website to allow fans to choose between two songs (\"Be My Yoko Ono\" and \"Alternative Girlfriend\") for inclusion on their greatest hits CD ''[[Disc One]]'' (though polling was nearly tied and both songs were included).\n\nBeginning in April 2003, the band started a [[blog]] on its website to keep fans updated personally, coinciding with the band's return to the studio for ''Everything to Everyone''. During a subsequent studio session, for ''Barenaked Ladies Are Me'', Ed Robertson began a [[podcast]] in addition to the blog, which ran from February to August 2006 (with a series of four videos added in early 2007 with highlights from the [[#Ships and Dip cruises|band's first cruise]]).\n\nThe band has adopted many of the current online social networking sites, including accounts on [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]]. The Twitter feed has been integrated into the band's website, and it also typically announces new blog posts with a link. These accounts have been used for contests and to debut new tracks. Different band members have also had individual accounts on these sites at times.\n\nBarenaked Ladies has sold recordings of almost all of its live concerts since early 2004. Initially, shows were sold on [[CD-R]] or as [[MP3]] downloads. By the end of 2004, lossless [[FLAC]] files were also offered. Professionally printed copies of some concerts were later offered through some isolated record stores, and some shows have been added to the [[iTunes Music Store]]s and other digital retailers.\n\nThe band was praised for a unique use of [[USB flash drive]] technology. The group offered its 2004 ''Barenaked For the Holidays'' album on a customized flash drive in MP3 format, with extras including bonus tracks, and photos and videos from the studio sessions for the album. The band used a 128 MB USB flash drive, limiting the bitrate of the music included. The group described the product as a test of the technology and the market for that technology. It subsequently released ''Are Me'' in the USB format as well (on a 256 MB flash drive). The band also incorporated the technology into its live music sales, offering fans a copy of concerts in MP3 format on a USB stick at the merchandise booth directly after the show.\n\nIn 2009 the band took part in an interactive documentary series, ''[[City Sonic]]''. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, includes Tyler Stewart reflecting on his memories of the (now closed) Ultrasound Showbar. The films were accompanied by an [[iPhone]] application, which uses [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) technology to unlock more videos when the user is close to the specific location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |title=citysonic.tv |website=Citysonic.tv |accessdate=2011-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104210212/http://www.citysonic.tv/films/Barenaked-Ladies-at-Ultrasound-Showbar.php |archive-date=November 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the Barenaked Ladies participated in what was billed as the \"first space-to-earth musical collaboration\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAnfi8WpVE |title= Chris Hadfield and Barenaked Ladies: I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing) |publisher=CBC Music |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> involving the band and [[Chris Hadfield]], a Canadian astronaut and commander of the [[International Space Station]], along with the Wexford Gleeks, a Canadian student choir. The group, Hadfield and the choir performed a song \"I.S.S. (Is Somebody Singing)\" that was commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and the [[Canadian Space Agency]].\n\n==Ships and Dip cruises==\nFollowing a lead from other artists, the band held a fan cruise called \"Ships and Dip\", January 15\u201319, 2007. Other artists who joined the Ladies included side projects [[The Brothers Creeggan]], [[Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle]] and [[The Vanity Project]], as well as friends of the band, [[Guster]], [[Jason Plumb]], [[The New Odds]], and others. The ship also featured comedy from band friends [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] and [[Harland Williams]].\n\nThe success of the cruise led to a second cruise, incongruously named \"Ships and Dip III\", held January 27 \u2013 February 1, 2008. Many of the same artists were joined by newcomers such as [[Great Big Sea]], who were a headlining performer. The third annual cruise, \"Ships and Dip V\", sailed February 1\u20136, 2009, again featuring some returning and some new artists, adding [[Sarah McLachlan]] as an opening act for each of the band's three main theatre shows. Other new performers included [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], [[Luke Doucet]], [[The Mountain Goats]] and [[The Weakerthans]]. Page left the band shortly after Ships and Dip V, and his performances onboard are his last known performances with the band.\n\nThe fourth Ships and Dip cruise (dubbed \"Ships and Dip 4\", breaking with the odd-numbered naming convention of the first three cruises) sailed February 6\u201311, 2011 on the Norwegian Dawn from Miami, Florida. Ships and Dip 4 was the first (and thus far, only) Ships and Dip cruise since the departure of Steven Page.\n\nThe artists on the Ships and Dip cruises sailed on board with the rest of the passengers for the duration of the cruises; this contrasted some other music cruises at the time on which the artist or artists travelled separately to one of the cruise destinations and performed there, or joined the cruise for only a portion of the trip. Band members enjoyed other artists' shows and most of the ship's amenities freely with the other guests. Barenaked Ladies performed several full shows on each cruise, and the band members also commonly sat in with other artists at their shows.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{Infobox Musician Awards\n| name = Barenaked Ladies\n| image = Barenaked Ladies miming golf.jpg\n| caption = From left to right: Hearn, Stewart, Creeggan, and Robertson watch Page mime golfing during an ad lib in 2004.\n| wins = 14\n| nominations = 31\n| BillboardW = 2\n| BillboardN = 2\n| GrammyN = 2\n| JunoW = 8\n| JunoN = 18\n| MTVVideoN = 1\n| MuchMusicW = 4\n| MuchMusicN = 7\n| WorldW = 1\n| WorldN = 1\n}}\nIn 1993, Barenaked Ladies were nominated for their first four [[Juno Awards]]: Canadian Entertainer of the Year, Album of the year for ''Gordon'', Single of the Year for ''Enid'', and Group of the year, which was their only win.

Steven Page has acted as a conduit between the CMCC and the press, urging the government to focus on the Canadian cultural scene. Page has said the formation of the CMCC was in response to what he believes is the wrong direction taken by the [[RIAA]] and the major labels, by suing fans for filesharing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricsky.net/?p=145|title=Steven Page on the Canadian Music Creators Coalition - Electric Sky|website=Electricsky.net|accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Barenaked Planet===\nThe band has also become a proponent of environmentalism, following from Page's passion for greening (he is himself a board member of [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF Canada]]). The group began bringing an \"[[eco-village]]\" organized by the [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]] organization on their 2004 Au Naturale tour. The band has since partnered with Reverb to form the \"Barenaked Planet\" project, which is the group's label for their project to progressively \"green\" their touring. Efforts the band have made include ensuring backstage materials are recycled, using [[biodiesel]] in their tour vehicles (B20 as of December 2006), and [[carbon offset|offsetting carbon emissions]] with wind power. This includes both band-sponsored offsets for their own emissions, as well as having volunteers sell \"Barenaked Planet\" stickers to concertgoers with the money going to offset their drives to the venues.<ref name=\"GillDec28\">{{cite video\n  | people = [[Steven Page|Page, Steven]] & [[Gill Deacon|Deacon, Gill]] (Interviewer/Host)\n  | title = The Gill Deacon Show\n  | medium = TV-series\n  | publisher = [[CBC Television]]\n  | location = Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n  | date = December 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours ice cream===\nIn May 2009, BNL partnered with American ice cream company [[Ben & Jerry's]] to create the flavour If I Had 1,000,000 Flavours.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title_width = 20%\n| writing_width = 50%\n| extra_width = 30%\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title_width = 20%\n| writing_width = 50%\n| extra_width = 30%\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

Konitz's association with the cool jazz movement of the 1940s and 1950s includes participation in [[Miles Davis]]'s ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions and his work with pianist [[Lennie Tristano]]. He was notable during this era as one of relatively few alto saxophonists to retain a distinctive style when [[Charlie Parker]] exerted a massive influence.\n\nLike other students of Tristano, Konitz was noted for improvising long, melodic lines with the rhythmic interest coming from odd accents, or odd note groupings suggestive of the imposition of one time signature over another. Other saxophonists were strongly influenced by Konitz, notably [[Paul Desmond]] and [[Art Pepper]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Lee Konitz.jpg|thumb|Lee Konitz at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay, California, November 24, 1985]]\n\nKonitz was born on October 13, 1927, in Chicago to Jewish parents of Austrian and Russian descent. At the age of eleven, Konitz received his first clarinet. However, he later dropped the instrument in favor of the tenor saxophone. He eventually moved from tenor to alto. His greatest influences at the time were the swing [[big bands]]  he and his brother listened to on the radio; hearing Goodman on the radio was what prodded him to ask for a clarinet. He improvised on the saxophone before learning to play standards.<ref name=r1>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Michael|title=An interview with Lee Konitz|url=http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp |accessdate=2007-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025727/http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp|archivedate=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n\nKonitz began his professional career in 1945 with the [[Teddy Powell]] band as a replacement for [[Charlie Ventura]]. A month later, the band broke up. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked intermittently with [[Jerry Wald]]. In 1946, he met pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and the two worked together in a small cocktail bar. His next substantial work was with [[Claude Thornhill]] in 1947 with [[Gil Evans]] arranging and [[Gerry Mulligan]] as a composer.<ref>Hamilton, p. 265</ref><ref name=Gordon>Gordon, Jack. \"Lee Kontiz\", ''Jazz Journal'', December 1998, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\nHe participated with [[Miles Davis]] in a group that had a brief booking in September 1948 and another the following year, but he recorded in 1949 and 1950 the sides collected on the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' album. The presence of Konitz and other white musicians in the group angered some black jazz players because many were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\n\nKonitz has stated he considered the group to belong to Gerry Mulligan. His debut as leader also came in 1949 with sides collected on the album ''[[Subconscious-Lee]]''. ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]], 1955).<ref>Neal Umphred ''Goldmine's Price Guide to Collectible Jazz Albums' 1949\u201369'', [[Iola, Wisconsin]]: Krause Publications, 1994, p.290</ref> He turned down an opportunity to work with Goodman in 1949, a decision he regretted.<ref name=Gordon/> Parker lent him support on the day Konitz's child was born in Seattle, Washington, while he was stuck in New York City. The two were good friends, not the rivals some jazz critics made them out to be.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Konitz recorded and toured with [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, but he continued to record as a leader. In 1961, he recorded ''[[Motion (Lee Konitz album)|Motion]]'' with [[Elvin Jones]] on drums and [[Sonny Dallas]] on bass. This spontaneous session consisted entirely of standards. The loose trio format aptly featured Konitz's unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism.\n\n[[File:lee-konitz.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Lee Konitz playing in [[Aarhus, Denmark]]]]\n\nIn 1967, Konitz recorded ''The Lee Konitz Duets'' in configurations that were often unusual for the period (saxophone and trombone, two saxophones). The recordings drew on nearly the entire history of jazz from [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" with valve trombonist [[Marshall Brown (musician)|Marshall Brown]] to two [[free improvisation]] duos: one with a [[Duke Ellington]] associate, violinist [[Ray Nance]], and one with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]].\n\nKonitz contributed to the film score for ''[[Desperate Characters]]'' (1971). In 1981, he performed at the [[Woodstock Jazz Festival]], which was held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the [[Creative Music Studio]].\n\nKonitz has worked with [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Attila Zoller]], Gerry Mulligan, and Elvin Jones.

Konitz's association with the cool jazz movement of the 1940s and 1950s includes participation in [[Miles Davis]]'s ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions and his work with pianist [[Lennie Tristano]]. He was notable during this era as one of relatively few alto saxophonists to retain a distinctive style when [[Charlie Parker]] exerted a massive influence.\n\nLike other students of Tristano, Konitz was noted for improvising long, melodic lines with the rhythmic interest coming from odd accents, or odd note groupings suggestive of the imposition of one time signature over another. Other saxophonists were strongly influenced by Konitz, notably [[Paul Desmond]] and [[Art Pepper]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Lee Konitz.jpg|thumb|Lee Konitz at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay, California, November 24, 1985]]\n\nKonitz was born on October 13, 1927, in Chicago to Jewish parents of Austrian and Russian descent. At the age of eleven, Konitz received his first clarinet. However, he later dropped the instrument in favor of the tenor saxophone. He eventually moved from tenor to alto. His greatest influences at the time were the swing [[big bands]]  he and his brother listened to on the radio; hearing Goodman on the radio was what prodded him to ask for a clarinet. He improvised on the saxophone before learning to play standards.<ref name=r1>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Michael|title=An interview with Lee Konitz|url=http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp |accessdate=2007-05-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025727/http://www.sawf.org/Newedit/edit09182000/musicarts.asp|archivedate=2011-07-20}}</ref>\n\nKonitz began his professional career in 1945 with the [[Teddy Powell]] band as a replacement for [[Charlie Ventura]]. A month later, the band broke up. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked intermittently with [[Jerry Wald]]. In 1946, he met pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], and the two worked together in a small cocktail bar. His next substantial work was with [[Claude Thornhill]] in 1947 with [[Gil Evans]] arranging and [[Gerry Mulligan]] as a composer.<ref>Hamilton, p. 265</ref><ref name=Gordon>Gordon, Jack. \"Lee Kontiz\", ''Jazz Journal'', December 1998, pp. 6\u20138</ref>\n\nHe participated with [[Miles Davis]] in a group that had a brief booking in September 1948 and another the following year, but he recorded in 1949 and 1950 the sides collected on the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' album. The presence of Konitz and other white musicians in the group angered some black jazz players because many were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms.\n\nKonitz has stated he considered the group to belong to Gerry Mulligan. His debut as leader also came in 1949 with sides collected on the album ''[[Subconscious-Lee]]''. ([[Prestige Records|Prestige]], 1955).<ref>Neal Umphred ''Goldmine's Price Guide to Collectible Jazz Albums' 1949\u201369'', [[Iola, Wisconsin]]: Krause Publications, 1994, p.290</ref> He turned down an opportunity to work with Goodman in 1949, a decision he regretted.<ref name=Gordon/> Parker lent him support on the day Konitz's child was born in Seattle, Washington, while he was stuck in New York City. The two were good friends, not the rivals some jazz critics made them out to be.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Konitz recorded and toured with [[Stan Kenton]]'s orchestra, but he continued to record as a leader. In 1961, he recorded ''[[Motion (Lee Konitz album)|Motion]]'' with [[Elvin Jones]] on drums and [[Sonny Dallas]] on bass. This spontaneous session consisted entirely of standards. The loose trio format aptly featured Konitz's unorthodox phrasing and chromaticism.\n\n[[File:lee-konitz.jpg|thumb|left|265px|Lee Konitz playing in [[Aarhus, Denmark]]]]\n\nIn 1967, Konitz recorded ''The Lee Konitz Duets'' in configurations that were often unusual for the period (saxophone and trombone, two saxophones). The recordings drew on nearly the entire history of jazz from [[Louis Armstrong]]'s \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" with valve trombonist [[Marshall Brown (musician)|Marshall Brown]] to two [[free improvisation]] duos: one with a [[Duke Ellington]] associate, violinist [[Ray Nance]], and one with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]].\n\nKonitz contributed to the film score for ''[[Desperate Characters]]'' (1971). In 1981, he performed at the [[Woodstock Jazz Festival]], which was held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the [[Creative Music Studio]].\n\nKonitz has worked with [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Attila Zoller]], Gerry Mulligan, and Elvin Jones. He recorded trio dates with [[Brad Mehldau]] and [[Charlie Haden]], released by Blue Note, as well as [[Live at Birdland (Lee Konitz album)|a live album recorded in 2009 at Birdland]] and released by ECM in 2011 with drummer [[Paul Motian]].
