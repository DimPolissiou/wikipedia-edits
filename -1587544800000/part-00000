The female matures at two years old and the male at three years old. \n\nBetween June and August, males return to shore to renovate or dig new burrows and display to attract a mate for the season. Males compete for partners with their displays. Breeding occurs annually, but the timing and duration of the breeding season varies from location to location and from year to year. Breeding occurs during spring and summer when oceans are most productive and food is plentiful. \n\nLittle penguins remain faithful to their partner during a breeding season and whilst hatching eggs. At other times of the year they tend to swap burrows. They exhibit [[philopatry|site fidelity]] to their nesting colonies and nesting sites over successive years. Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.<ref name=\"Flemming\" />\n==== Nesting ====\nPenguins' nests vary depending on the available habitat. They are established close to the sea in sandy burrows excavated by the birds' feet or dug previously by other animals. Nests may also be made in caves, rock crevices, under logs or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. Nests have been occasionally observed to be shared with [[Prion (bird)|prions]], while some burrows are occupied by [[Short-tailed shearwater|short-tailed shearwaters]] and little penguins in alternating seasons. In the 1980s, little was known on the subject of competition for burrows between bird species.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Timing ====\nThe timing of breeding seasons varies across the species' range. In the 1980s, it the first egg laid at a penguin colony on Australia's eastern coast could be expected to come as early as May or as late as October.

They are the only species of penguin capable of producing more than one clutch of eggs per breeding season, but few populations do so. In ideal conditions, a penguin pair is capable of raising two or even three clutches of eggs over an extended season, which can last between eight and twenty-eight weeks.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe one or two (on rare occasions, three) white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid between one and four days apart. Each egg typically weighs around 55 grams at time of laying.<ref name=\":9\" /> Incubation takes up to 36 days. Chicks are brooded for 18\u201338 days and fledge after 7\u20138 weeks.<ref name=\"Flemming\" /> On Australia's east coast, chicks are raised from August through March.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Gulf St. Vincent, chicks are raised from June through November.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nLittle penguins typically return to their colonies to feed their chicks at dusk. The birds tend to come ashore in small groups to provide some defence against predators, which might otherwise pick off individuals. In Australia, the strongest colonies are usually on cat-free and fox-free islands. However, the population on [[Granite Island (South Australia)|Granite Island]] (which is a fox, cat and dog-free island) has been severely depleted, from around 2000 penguins in 2001 down to 22 in 2015. Granite Island is connected to the mainland via a timber causeway.\n\n== Native predators ==\nPredation by native animals is not considered a threat to little penguin populations, as these predators' diets are diverse.

The female matures at two years old and the male at three years old. \n\nBetween June and August, males return to shore to renovate or dig new burrows and display to attract a mate for the season. Males compete for partners with their displays. Breeding occurs annually, but the timing and duration of the breeding season varies from location to location and from year to year. Breeding occurs during spring and summer when oceans are most productive and food is plentiful. \n\nLittle penguins remain faithful to their partner during a breeding season and whilst hatching eggs. At other times of the year they tend to swap burrows. They exhibit [[philopatry|site fidelity]] to their nesting colonies and nesting sites over successive years. Little penguins can breed as isolated pairs, in colonies, or semi-colonially.<ref name=\"Flemming\" />\n==== Nesting ====\nPenguins' nests vary depending on the available habitat. They are established close to the sea in sandy burrows excavated by the birds' feet or dug previously by other animals. Nests may also be made in caves, rock crevices, under logs or in or under a variety of man-made structures including nest boxes, pipes, stacks of wood or timber, and buildings. Nests have been occasionally observed to be shared with [[Prion (bird)|prions]], while some burrows are occupied by [[Short-tailed shearwater|short-tailed shearwaters]] and little penguins in alternating seasons. In the 1980s, little was known on the subject of competition for burrows between bird species.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==== Timing ====\nThe timing of breeding seasons varies across the species' range. In the 1980s, it the first egg laid at a penguin colony on Australia's eastern coast could be expected to come as early as May or as late as October. Eastern Australian populations (including at Phillip Island, Victoria) lay their eggs from July through December.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://penguinfoundation.org.au/about-little-penguins/#Yearly1|title=About Little Penguins|website=penguinfoundation.org.au|access-date=3 April 2016}}</ref> In South Australia's [[Gulf St Vincent|Gulf St. Vincent]], eggs are laid between April and October<ref name=\":7\">Wiebkin, A.

They are the only species of penguin capable of producing more than one clutch of eggs per breeding season, but few populations do so. In ideal conditions, a penguin pair is capable of raising two or even three clutches of eggs over an extended season, which can last between eight and twenty-eight weeks.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nThe one or two (on rare occasions, three) white or lightly mottled brown eggs are laid between one and four days apart. Each egg typically weighs around 55 grams at time of laying.<ref name=\":9\" /> Incubation takes up to 36 days. Chicks are brooded for 18\u201338 days and fledge after 7\u20138 weeks.<ref name=\"Flemming\" /> On Australia's east coast, chicks are raised from August through March.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Gulf St. Vincent, chicks are raised from June through November.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nLittle penguins typically return to their colonies to feed their chicks at dusk. The birds tend to come ashore in small groups to provide some defence against predators, which might otherwise pick off individuals. In Australia, the strongest colonies are usually on cat-free and fox-free islands. However, the population on [[Granite Island (South Australia)|Granite Island]] (which is a fox, cat and dog-free island) has been severely depleted, from around 2000 penguins in 2001 down to 22 in 2015. Granite Island is connected to the mainland via a timber causeway.\n\n== Native predators ==\nPredation by native animals is not considered a threat to little penguin populations, as these predators' diets are diverse.

In 1891, financial difficulties forced Omelianski to work as laboratory chemist in a metallurgical factory in Southern Russia<ref name=\":0\" />. However, two years later he became the assistant of [[Sergei Winogradsky|S. N. Winogradsky]], who hired him on recommendation of Menshutkin, at the new-founded [[Institute of Experimental Medicine|Imperial Institute of Experimental Medicine]]. Omelianski supported Winogradskys work on [[nitrification]]. Later on he studied the [[fermentation]] of [[cellulose]] und did research on [[nitrogen fixation]] on his own<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nIn 1909, he published the textbook \"Principles of Microbiology\"<ref name=\":0\" /> (''\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b \u043c\u0438\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438'') which was the first original Russian textbook on microbiology and remained a standard work at Soviet universities till the 1950s.

In 1923, he became of full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1926, he affiliated with the [[American Society for Microbiology|Society of American Bacteriologists]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and the Lombardic Academical Society. Omelianski was one of the most gifted chessplayers in town around 1900<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Personal life ==\nOmelianski was married and had a doughter, Maria Vasilevna Stepanova (1901-1946, an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]])<ref name=\":1\" />. During [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], Omelianski was able to stay in Saint Petersburg, while Winogradsky (as a rich landowner) had to escape. Possibly, he was saved by his poor bourgeois ancestry and his popular commitment by publishing Russian text books and journals and lecturing in a women\u2019s college. In springtime 1927, Omelianski travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris to visit his mentor Winogradsky. There he suffered a first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Omelianski had a second heart attack in December 1927 but could recover<ref name=\":1\" />. During a vacation in [[Gagra]] ([[Abkhazia]]) he died on April 21, 1928<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Impact on methanogenesis research ==\nOmelianski published only once in English on \u201caroma-producing microorganisms\u201d in the American [[Journal of Bacteriology]] in 1923<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Omelianski|first=V.

In 1891, financial difficulties forced Omelianski to work as laboratory chemist in a metallurgical factory in Southern Russia<ref name=\":0\" />. However, two years later he became the assistant of [[Sergei Winogradsky|S. N. Winogradsky]], who hired him on recommendation of Menshutkin, at the new-founded [[Institute of Experimental Medicine|Imperial Institute of Experimental Medicine]]. Omelianski supported Winogradskys work on [[nitrification]].

In 1923, he became of full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1926, he affiliated with the [[American Society for Microbiology|Society of American Bacteriologists]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and the Lombardic Academical Society. Omelianski was one of the most gifted chessplayers in town around 1900<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Personal life ==\nOmelianski was married and had a doughter, Maria Vasilevna Stepanova (1901-1946, an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]])<ref name=\":1\" />. During [[World War I]], the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]], Omelianski was able to stay in Saint Petersburg, while Winogradsky (as a rich landowner) had to escape. Possibly, he was saved by his poor bourgeois ancestry and his popular commitment by publishing Russian text books and journals and lecturing in a women\u2019s college. In springtime 1927, Omelianski travelled to the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris to visit his mentor Winogradsky. There he suffered a first [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Omelianski had a second heart attack in December 1927 but could recover<ref name=\":1\" />.

One of his routines involved interviewing pigeons on the roof of the local courthouse that would report on the political corruption they had seen. Carson supplemented his income by serving as master of ceremonies at local church dinners, attended by some of the same politicians and civic leaders whom he had lampooned on the radio.\n\n[[File:Jack Benny Johnny Carson Benny Show 1955.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Carson as a guest on Jack Benny's television program, 1955]]\nThe wife of one of the Omaha political figures Carson spoofed owned stock in a radio station in Los Angeles, and in 1951 referred Carson to her brother, who was influential in the emerging television market in Southern California.

In 1953, comic [[Red Skelton]]\u2014a fan of Carson's \"cult success\" low-budget sketch comedy show, ''Carson's Cellar'' (1951 to 1953) on KNXT\u2014asked Carson to join his show as a writer.

Carson then successfully filled in for him.{{r|tynan19780220}} In 1955, [[Jack Benny]] invited Carson to appear on one of his programs during the opening and closing segments.

After the primetime ''The Johnny Carson Show'' failed, he moved to New York City to host [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Who Do You Trust?]]'' (1957\u20131962), formerly known as ''[[Do You Trust Your Wife?]]'' On ''Who Do You Trust?'', Carson met his future [[sidekick]] and [[straight man]], [[Ed McMahon]]. Although he believed moving to [[daytime television]] would hurt his career, ''Who Do You Trust?'' was a success. It was the first show where he could [[ad lib]] and interview guests,{{r|pioneersoftv}} and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became \"the hottest item on daytime television\" during his six years at ABC.{{r|tynan19780220}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n== ''The Tonight Show'' ==\n{{Main|The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson}}\n[[File:Johnny carson 1957.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Carson in 1957]]\nNBC's ''Tonight'' was the late-night counterpart to its early-morning show ''Today''. Originating in 1954 with host Steve Allen, ''Tonight'' was somewhat experimental at the time, as the only previous network late-night program was NBC's ''[[Broadway Open House]]'' which starred [[Jerry Lester]] and [[Dagmar (American actress)|Dagmar]]. ''Tonight'' was successful, and when Allen moved on to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1956, [[Jack Paar]] replaced him as host of ''Tonight''. Paar left the show in 1962.\n\nCarson's success on ABC's ''Who Do You Trust?'' led NBC to invite him to take over ''Tonight'' a few months before Paar's departure. Carson declined the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes each day. [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Groucho Marx]], and [[Joey Bishop]] all also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job for the first time on the February 11, 1962, episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VK4jCnt3Nw&t=19m50s|title=What's My Line? - Toots Shor; Johnny Carson; Tony Randall & Martin Gabel [panel] (Feb 11, 1962)|date=September 1, 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over.

After a difficult first year, he overcame his fears.{{r|pioneersoftv}} While ''Tonight'' under its previous hosts had been successful, especially under Paar, Carson's version eventually did very well in the ratings. [[Billy Wilder]] said of Carson:\n\n{{quote|By the simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids and the insomniacs as well as the people who have to get up at dawn. He is the [[Valium]] and the [[Nembutal]] of a nation. No matter what kind of dead-asses are on the show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit. He does his work and he comes prepared. If he's talking to an author, he has read the book. Even his rehearsed routines sound improvised. He's the cream of middle-class elegance, yet he's not a mannequin. He has captivated the American bourgeoisie without ever offending the highbrows, and he has never said anything that wasn't liberal or progressive. Every night, in front of millions of people, he has to do the ''salto mortale'' [a circus parlance for an aerial somersault performed on the tightrope]. What's more, he does it without a net. No rewrites. No retakes.

McMahon's famous introduction, \"Heeeeere's Johnny!!!\" was followed by a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews, and music. Carson's trademark was a phantom golf swing at the end of his monologues, aimed [[stage left]] toward the studio orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. Bob Newhart rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.)\n\n[[Paul Anka]] wrote the theme song, (\"[[Johnny's Theme]]\"), a reworking of his \"Toot Sweet\"; given lyrics, it was renamed, \"It's Really Love\" and recorded by [[Annette Funicello]] in 1959. Before taking over ''The Tonight Show'', Carson wrote lyrics for the song, so claimed 50 percent of the song's performance royalties (though the lyrics were never used). The theme is heard being played on sound recordings of Carson's first ''Tonight Show'', and it was used without interruption through to his last broadcast on May 22, 1992.\n\nThe show was originally produced at the 30 Rockefeller Plaza NBC television studios in New York City, with occasional stints in California. The program began videotaping in advance during the Jack Paar days, although during the 1970s, NBC fed the live taping from [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] to New York via satellite for editing (see [[#Carson uncensored on satellite|below]]). Carson had a talent for quick quips to deal with problems.{{r|tynan19780220}} If the opening monologue fared poorly, the band would start playing \"[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]\" and Carson danced a softshoe to laughs from the studio audience.

Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for ''The Best of Carson''\u2014rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.\n\nAlthough Carson's work schedule became more abbreviated, ''Tonight'' remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about $4 million a year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1978|r=-3}}}} today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses.

Geller said \"This scares me.\" and \"I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.\" Geller was unable to display any [[paranormal]] abilities, saying \"I don't feel strong\" and he expressed his displeasure at feeling like he was being \"pressed\" to perform by Carson.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics Documentary (Full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI|website=Youtube.com|publisher=JREF|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|8:10}} According to Adam Higginbotham's November 7, 2014 article in the ''New York Times'':\n\n{{quote|text=The result was a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again. \"I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated,\" Geller told me, when I spoke to him in September. \"I went back to my hotel, devastated.

A review |website=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 14, 2019|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref> whose theme song was \"[[Hooray for Hollywood]]\". Carson once admitted on camera that this was his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: \"[[Slim Pickens]], [[Patti Page]], 'Duke' [[John Wayne]], and [[Charlton Heston]] in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!\" Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of [[Jackie Gleason]]'s \"Reginald Van Gleason III\" character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress [[Carol Wayne]] became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971\u20131982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matin\u00e9e Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting \"''Ho''&nbsp;\u2014 leeeee!\" and turning almost everything she said into a sexual [[double entendre]]. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air for most of the next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then [[Teresa Ganzel]] to play the Matin\u00e9e Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at \"the fork in the road\". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the \"[[California State Route 90#History|Slauson Cutoff]]\", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abruptly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to \"Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get back in your car,\" often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.\n* [[Carnac the Magnificent]], a turbaned psychic, could answer questions before seeing them. Carnac had a trademark entrance in which he always turned the wrong direction when coming onto stage and then tripped on the step up to Carson's desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson's desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac's true prescient abilities. McMahon would hand Carson a series of envelopes containing questions, said to have been \"hermetically sealed and kept in a mayonnaise jar on [[Funk and Wagnall's|Funk & Wagnall]]'s porch since noon today.\" Carson would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as \"Gatorade\". Then, he would read the question: \"What does an alligator get on welfare?\" Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carson's lack of comic success (\"Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings\"), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]] wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had McMahon and Carson nearly rolling on the floor with sustained laughter was \"[[Sis, boom, bah]]\" Answer \u2013 \"Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes.\" McMahon would always announce near the end, \"I hold in my hand the ''last'' envelope,\" at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic \"curse\" on the audience, such as \"May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!\", \"May your sister elope with a camel!\", \"May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister\", or the most famous: \"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The character was taken from [[Steve Allen]]'s essentially identical \"Answer Man\" segment, which Allen performed during his tenure as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28cMReggGGEC&pg=PA172 |title=The Columbia History of Television|page=172 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |date=2009| last=Edgerton| first=Gary R. |isbn=9780231121651| accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref> As Allen acknowledged in his book ''The Question Man'', this bit had been created in Kansas City in 1951 by [[Bob Arbogast]] and used on ''The [[Tom Poston]] Show'' in New York where it eventually ended up on ''The Steve Allen Show'', much to the surprise of both Bob and Steve.

Often, his tricks would include an attempt to bilk money from Ed McMahon or would end with his begging the audience for a dollar, or at least bus fare.\n* The Maharishi, whose theme song was \"[[Sadko (opera)#Principal arias and numbers|Song of India]]\", was a frizzy-haired \"holy man\" who spoke in a high-pitched, tranquil tone, greeted announcer McMahon with a flower, and answered philosophical questions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  This was a take-off on [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\n=== Carson uncensored on satellite ===\nAlthough Carson's program moved to Burbank in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the show remained in New York, requiring that the program be transmitted between the two cities. In 1976, NBC used the [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom]] 2 satellite to achieve this, feeding the live taping (which started around 5:30 pm local time) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the late-night broadcast. This live feed lasted usually for two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was both uncensored and commercial-free. During the slots for commercial breaks, the audio and picture feed would continue, capturing at times risqu\u00e9 language and other events that would be edited out before transmission.\n\nAt the same time, satellite ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge of things they were not meant to see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The satellite link was replaced by microwave transmission until the show's editing facilities were moved to Burbank.<ref>{{cite video|people=Cooper, Jr., Robert B.|title=Television's Pirates: Hiding Behind Your Picture Tube|date=2006}}</ref>\n\n== Effect on popular culture ==\nCarson's show launched the careers of many performers, especially comedians and musicians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting Carson to laugh and being invited to the guest chair were considered the highest honors.{{r|tynan19780220}} Notable among these were [[David Letterman]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Brenner]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Howie Mandel]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]. Carson was successor to ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' as a showcase for different types of talent, as well as continuing a [[vaudeville]]-style variety show.\n\nIn 1966, Carson popularized [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley's]] game [[Twister (game)|Twister]] when he played it with actress [[Eva Gabor]]. Not widely known up to that time, the game skyrocketed in popularity after the broadcast.<ref>\"Menace to Morals: Twister.\" ''Minnesota Monthly'', January 2011, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversies and feuds ==\nCarson often made jokes at the expense of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the [[Aladdin Hotel & Casino]] in Las Vegas, and a competing group led by [[Wayne Newton]] successfully bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was often portrayed by the media as having \"lost\" the deal and reacted by telling jokes on his show about Newton, who had spent a great deal of effort building a masculine image. This created something of a high-profile feud between Carson and Newton. Years later, Newton appeared on ''Larry King Live'', declaring that \"Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it.\"<ref name=\"justin\">{{cite news | work=[[CNN]]| title=Wayne Newton on Larry King Live| url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/29/lkl.01.html| accessdate=May 11, 2008}}</ref> Newton has often told of personally confronting Carson; after the final straw, Newton barged into his office at the studio and threatened to beat him up unless the jokes stopped.

His farewell was a major media event, often emotional for Carson, his colleagues, and the audiences, and stretched over several nights. In tribute to Carson and his enormous influence, several networks that had late-night variety talk shows \"went dark\" for the entire hour he did the last show. ''The Tonight Show'' finally won the Emmy for Outstanding Late-night Series after 13 tries later that year, buoyed by the penultimate broadcast which featured Johnny's final two guests, [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bette Midler]].\n\nNBC gave the role of host to the show's then-current permanent guest host, Jay Leno. Leno and David Letterman were soon competing on separate networks.\n\n=== Post-retirement appearances ===\n[[File:JohnnyCarson1994.jpg|thumb|right|On a trip to Tanzania in 1994]]\nAt the end of his final ''Tonight Show'' episode, Carson indicated that he might, if so inspired, return with a new project. Instead, he chose to go into full retirement, rarely giving interviews and declining to participate in NBC's 75th-anniversary celebrations. He made an occasional cameo appearance, including voicing himself on the May 13, 1993, episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (\"[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]\"), telephoning David Letterman on a November 1993 episode of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and appearing in the 1993 NBC special ''[[Bob Hope]]: The First 90 Years''.\n\nOn May 13, 1994, Carson appeared on the ''Late Show with David Letterman''. During a week of shows from Los Angeles, Letterman was having Larry \"Bud\" Melman ([[Calvert DeForest]]) deliver his \"Top Ten Lists\" under the guise that a famous personality would be delivering the list, instead. On the last show of the week, Letterman indicated that Carson would be delivering the list. Instead, DeForest delivered the list, insulted the audience (in keeping with the gag), and walked off to polite applause. Letterman then indicated that the card he was given did not have the proper list on it and asked that the \"real\" list be brought out. On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman's band played \"Johnny's Theme\"), an appearance that prompted a standing ovation from the audience. Carson then asked to sit behind Letterman's desk; Letterman obliged, as the audience continued to cheer and applaud. After some moments, Carson departed from the show without having spoken to the audience. He later cited acute [[laryngitis]] as the reason for his silence. This turned out to be Carson's last television appearance.\n\n=== Letterman ===\nJust days before Carson's death, ''The New York Times'' published a story revealing that he occasionally sent jokes to David Letterman.<ref>{{cite news | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Carson Feeds Letterman Lines | url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20%2C+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | accessdate=May 11, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714223159/http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20,+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | archivedate=July 14, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Letterman would then use these jokes in the monologue of his show, which Carson got \"a big kick out of\", according to [[Worldwide Pants]] Inc.

One of his routines involved interviewing pigeons on the roof of the local courthouse that would report on the political corruption they had seen. Carson supplemented his income by serving as master of ceremonies at local church dinners, attended by some of the same politicians and civic leaders whom he had lampooned on the radio.\n\n[[File:Jack Benny Johnny Carson Benny Show 1955.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Carson as a guest on Jack Benny's television program, 1955]]\nThe wife of one of the Omaha political figures Carson spoofed owned stock in a radio station in Los Angeles, and in 1951 referred Carson to her brother, who was influential in the emerging television market in Southern California.

After the primetime ''The Johnny Carson Show'' failed, he moved to New York City to host [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Who Do You Trust?]]'' (1957\u20131962), formerly known as ''[[Do You Trust Your Wife?]]'' On ''Who Do You Trust?'', Carson met his future [[sidekick]] and [[straight man]], [[Ed McMahon]]. Although he believed moving to [[daytime television]] would hurt his career, ''Who Do You Trust?'' was a success. It was the first show where he could [[ad lib]] and interview guests,{{r|pioneersoftv}} and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became \"the hottest item on daytime television\" during his six years at ABC.{{r|tynan19780220}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n== ''The Tonight Show'' ==\n{{Main|The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson}}\n[[File:Johnny carson 1957.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Carson in 1957]]\nNBC's ''Tonight'' was the late-night counterpart to its early-morning show ''Today''. Originating in 1954 with host Steve Allen, ''Tonight'' was somewhat experimental at the time, as the only previous network late-night program was NBC's ''[[Broadway Open House]]'' which starred [[Jerry Lester]] and [[Dagmar (American actress)|Dagmar]]. ''Tonight'' was successful, and when Allen moved on to primetime comedy-variety shows in 1956, [[Jack Paar]] replaced him as host of ''Tonight''. Paar left the show in 1962.\n\nCarson's success on ABC's ''Who Do You Trust?'' led NBC to invite him to take over ''Tonight'' a few months before Paar's departure. Carson declined the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes each day. [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Groucho Marx]], and [[Joey Bishop]] all also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job for the first time on the February 11, 1962, episode of ''[[What's My Line?]]''.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VK4jCnt3Nw&t=19m50s|title=What's My Line? - Toots Shor; Johnny Carson; Tony Randall & Martin Gabel [panel] (Feb 11, 1962)|date=September 1, 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over. Guest hosts included [[Merv Griffin]], [[Art Linkletter]], Joey Bishop, [[Arlene Francis]] (the first woman to host ''The Tonight Show''), [[Bob Cummings]], [[Jerry Lewis]], Groucho Marx, [[Donald O'Connor]], and others.{{r|pioneersoftv}}{{r|tynan19780220}}\n\nAlthough he continued to have doubts about his new job, Carson became the host of ''Tonight'' (later becoming ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'') on October 1, 1962. After a difficult first year, he overcame his fears.{{r|pioneersoftv}} While ''Tonight'' under its previous hosts had been successful, especially under Paar, Carson's version eventually did very well in the ratings. [[Billy Wilder]] said of Carson:\n\n{{quote|By the simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids and the insomniacs as well as the people who have to get up at dawn. He is the [[Valium]] and the [[Nembutal]] of a nation. No matter what kind of dead-asses are on the show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit. He does his work and he comes prepared. If he's talking to an author, he has read the book. Even his rehearsed routines sound improvised. He's the cream of middle-class elegance, yet he's not a mannequin. He has captivated the American bourgeoisie without ever offending the highbrows, and he has never said anything that wasn't liberal or progressive. Every night, in front of millions of people, he has to do the ''salto mortale'' [a circus parlance for an aerial somersault performed on the tightrope]. What's more, he does it without a net. No rewrites. No retakes.

McMahon's famous introduction, \"Heeeeere's Johnny!!!\" was followed by a brief monologue by Carson. This was often followed by comedy sketches, interviews, and music. Carson's trademark was a phantom golf swing at the end of his monologues, aimed [[stage left]] toward the studio orchestra. (Guest hosts sometimes parodied that gesture. Bob Newhart rolled an imaginary bowling ball toward the audience.)\n\n[[Paul Anka]] wrote the theme song, (\"[[Johnny's Theme]]\"), a reworking of his \"Toot Sweet\"; given lyrics, it was renamed, \"It's Really Love\" and recorded by [[Annette Funicello]] in 1959. Before taking over ''The Tonight Show'', Carson wrote lyrics for the song, so claimed 50 percent of the song's performance royalties (though the lyrics were never used). The theme is heard being played on sound recordings of Carson's first ''Tonight Show'', and it was used without interruption through to his last broadcast on May 22, 1992.\n\nThe show was originally produced at the 30 Rockefeller Plaza NBC television studios in New York City, with occasional stints in California. The program began videotaping in advance during the Jack Paar days, although during the 1970s, NBC fed the live taping from [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] to New York via satellite for editing (see [[#Carson uncensored on satellite|below]]). Carson had a talent for quick quips to deal with problems.{{r|tynan19780220}} If the opening monologue fared poorly, the band would start playing \"[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]\" and Carson danced a softshoe to laughs from the studio audience.

Eventually, Monday night was for Leno, Tuesday for ''The Best of Carson''\u2014rebroadcasts usually dating from a year earlier, but occasionally from the 1970s.\n\nAlthough Carson's work schedule became more abbreviated, ''Tonight'' remained so successful that his compensation from NBC continued to rise; by the mid-1970s, he had become the highest-paid personality on television, earning about $4 million a year (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000000|1978|r=-3}}}} today), not including nightclub appearances and his other businesses.

Geller said \"This scares me.\" and \"I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me.\" Geller was unable to display any [[paranormal]] abilities, saying \"I don't feel strong\" and he expressed his displeasure at feeling like he was being \"pressed\" to perform by Carson.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics Documentary (Full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI|website=Youtube.com|publisher=JREF|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref>{{rp|8:10}} According to Adam Higginbotham's November 7, 2014 article in the ''New York Times'':\n\n{{quote|text=The result was a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again. \"I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated,\" Geller told me, when I spoke to him in September. \"I went back to my hotel, devastated.

A review |website=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 14, 2019|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref> whose theme song was \"[[Hooray for Hollywood]]\". Carson once admitted on camera that this was his favorite character, based on late-afternoon TV hosts who would deliver commercials throughout the movie. Each sketch usually featured three long commercials interrupted by silent, four-second clips from antique films. When the camera returned from each clip, Art was always caught off-guard and immediately reminded viewers that they were watching a film favorite. The movies always had unlikely casts and even less likely titles: \"[[Slim Pickens]], [[Patti Page]], 'Duke' [[John Wayne]], and [[Charlton Heston]] in another classic Western: 'Kiss My Saddle Horn'!\" Carson originally played the fast-talking huckster in his own voice (as Honest Bernie Schlock or Ralph Willie), and finally settled on a nasal, high-pitched, smarmy drone, reminiscent of [[Jackie Gleason]]'s \"Reginald Van Gleason III\" character. The character, now permanently known as Art Fern, wore a lavish toupee, loud jackets, and a pencil mustache. Actress [[Carol Wayne]] became famous for her 100-plus appearances (1971\u20131982) as Art's buxom assistant, the Matin\u00e9e Lady. While Art gave his spiel, she would enter the stage behind him. Art would react to her attractive body by wincing, loudly shouting \"''Ho''&nbsp;\u2014 leeeee!\" and turning almost everything she said into a sexual [[double entendre]]. After Carol Wayne's death in 1985, Carson kept Art Fern off the air for most of the next year, and finally hired Danuta Wesley and then [[Teresa Ganzel]] to play the Matin\u00e9e Lady. Carson also used these sketches to poke fun at the intricate Los Angeles interstate system, using a pointer and map to give confusing directions to shoppers, often including points where he would unfold the cardboard map to point out, via the appropriate picture, when the shopper would arrive at \"the fork in the road\". Another freeway routine in the same theme centered on the \"[[California State Route 90#History|Slauson Cutoff]]\", a slang term Carson popularized to describe the truncated Marina Freeway (which ended abruptly at Slauson Avenue in Culver City). Art Fern would advise drivers to take a series of freeways until they reached the Slauson Cutoff, and would then advise them to \"Get out of your car, cut off your slauson, get back in your car,\" often followed by peals of laughter from the audience, led by McMahon.\n* [[Carnac the Magnificent]], a turbaned psychic, could answer questions before seeing them. Carnac had a trademark entrance in which he always turned the wrong direction when coming onto stage and then tripped on the step up to Carson's desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson's desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac's true prescient abilities. McMahon would hand Carson a series of envelopes containing questions, said to have been \"hermetically sealed and kept in a mayonnaise jar on [[Funk and Wagnall's|Funk & Wagnall]]'s porch since noon today.\" Carson would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as \"Gatorade\". Then, he would read the question: \"What does an alligator get on welfare?\" Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carson's lack of comic success (\"Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings\"), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. [[Pat McCormick (actor)|Pat McCormick]] wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had McMahon and Carson nearly rolling on the floor with sustained laughter was \"[[Sis, boom, bah]]\" Answer \u2013 \"Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes.\" McMahon would always announce near the end, \"I hold in my hand the ''last'' envelope,\" at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic \"curse\" on the audience, such as \"May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!\", \"May your sister elope with a camel!\", \"May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister\", or the most famous: \"May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The character was taken from [[Steve Allen]]'s essentially identical \"Answer Man\" segment, which Allen performed during his tenure as host of ''The Tonight Show'' in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28cMReggGGEC&pg=PA172 |title=The Columbia History of Television|page=172 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |date=2009| last=Edgerton| first=Gary R. |isbn=9780231121651| accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref> As Allen acknowledged in his book ''The Question Man'', this bit had been created in Kansas City in 1951 by [[Bob Arbogast]] and used on ''The [[Tom Poston]] Show'' in New York where it eventually ended up on ''The Steve Allen Show'', much to the surprise of both Bob and Steve.

Turbo]], American (with no pause between words) was a stereotypical common working man, wearing a plaid hunting coat and cap, who offered \"editorial responses\" to left-leaning causes or news events. Railing against women's rights in the workplace, for example, Turbo would shout: \"This raises the question: kiss my Dictaphone!\"\n* Aunt Blabby, a cantankerous and sometimes amorous old lady, was invariably interviewed by straight man Ed McMahon about elder affairs.<ref name=EW /> McMahon would innocently use a common expression like \"check out\", only to have Aunt Blabby warn him: \"Don't say 'check out' to an old person!\" Aunt Blabby was an obvious copy of [[Jonathan Winters]]' most famous creation, Maude Frickert, including her black spinster dress and wig.\n* El Mouldo, a mentalist, would attempt to perform mind-reading and mind-over-matter feats, all of which failed. Often, his tricks would include an attempt to bilk money from Ed McMahon or would end with his begging the audience for a dollar, or at least bus fare.\n* The Maharishi, whose theme song was \"[[Sadko (opera)#Principal arias and numbers|Song of India]]\", was a frizzy-haired \"holy man\" who spoke in a high-pitched, tranquil tone, greeted announcer McMahon with a flower, and answered philosophical questions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  This was a take-off on [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].\n\n=== Carson uncensored on satellite ===\nAlthough Carson's program moved to Burbank in 1972, NBC's editing and production services for the show remained in New York, requiring that the program be transmitted between the two cities. In 1976, NBC used the [[Satcom (satellite)|Satcom]] 2 satellite to achieve this, feeding the live taping (which started around 5:30 pm local time) directly to New York, where it would be edited prior to the late-night broadcast. This live feed lasted usually for two to two-and-a-half hours a night and was both uncensored and commercial-free. During the slots for commercial breaks, the audio and picture feed would continue, capturing at times risqu\u00e9 language and other events that would be edited out before transmission.\n\nAt the same time, satellite ground stations owned by individuals began appearing, and some found the live feed. Satellite dish owners began to document their sightings in technical journals, giving viewers knowledge of things they were not meant to see. Carson and his production staff grew concerned about this and pressured NBC into ceasing the satellite transmissions of the live taping in the early 1980s. The satellite link was replaced by microwave transmission until the show's editing facilities were moved to Burbank.<ref>{{cite video|people=Cooper, Jr., Robert B.|title=Television's Pirates: Hiding Behind Your Picture Tube|date=2006}}</ref>\n\n== Effect on popular culture ==\nCarson's show launched the careers of many performers, especially comedians and musicians. For a comedian appearing on the show, getting Carson to laugh and being invited to the guest chair were considered the highest honors.{{r|tynan19780220}} Notable among these were [[David Letterman]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Arsenio Hall]], [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Brenner]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Howie Mandel]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]. Carson was successor to ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' as a showcase for different types of talent, as well as continuing a [[vaudeville]]-style variety show.\n\nIn 1966, Carson popularized [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley's]] game [[Twister (game)|Twister]] when he played it with actress [[Eva Gabor]]. Not widely known up to that time, the game skyrocketed in popularity after the broadcast.<ref>\"Menace to Morals: Twister.\" ''Minnesota Monthly'', January 2011, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversies and feuds ==\nCarson often made jokes at the expense of other celebrities. In 1980, Carson backed out of a deal to acquire the [[Aladdin Hotel & Casino]] in Las Vegas, and a competing group led by [[Wayne Newton]] successfully bought the property. According to lawyer Henry Bushkin, Carson became annoyed that he was often portrayed by the media as having \"lost\" the deal and reacted by telling jokes on his show about Newton, who had spent a great deal of effort building a masculine image. This created something of a high-profile feud between Carson and Newton. Years later, Newton appeared on ''Larry King Live'', declaring that \"Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me.

He denied that was so, while declining to reveal his compensation in a subsequent interview with the newspaper, and called the article \"damned unfair.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/03/archives/carson-denies-times-report-on-his-new-contract.html|title=Carson Denies Times Report on His New Contract|last=Gould|first=Jack|date=July 3, 1969|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 27, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''The Times'' published a follow-up article saying that its initial reporter \"erred,\" and that $75,000 a week was unlikely.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/07/04/archives/report-on-income-of-carson-erred-75000-figure-found-to-be-unlikely.html|title=REPORT ON INCOME OF CARSON ERRED; $75,000 Figure Found to Be Unlikely -- Data Are Secret|last=Gould|first=Jack|date=July 4, 1969|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 27, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nCarson reportedly loathed what he perceived as disloyalty, and he was furious when former ''Tonight Show'' guest hosts [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] and [[Joan Rivers]] began hosting their own talk shows. Rivers' show on the [[Fox Network]] directly competed with Carson during the 1986\u20131987 season before being cancelled.

His farewell was a major media event, often emotional for Carson, his colleagues, and the audiences, and stretched over several nights. In tribute to Carson and his enormous influence, several networks that had late-night variety talk shows \"went dark\" for the entire hour he did the last show. ''The Tonight Show'' finally won the Emmy for Outstanding Late-night Series after 13 tries later that year, buoyed by the penultimate broadcast which featured Johnny's final two guests, [[Robin Williams]] and [[Bette Midler]].\n\nNBC gave the role of host to the show's then-current permanent guest host, Jay Leno. Leno and David Letterman were soon competing on separate networks.\n\n=== Post-retirement appearances ===\n[[File:JohnnyCarson1994.jpg|thumb|right|On a trip to Tanzania in 1994]]\nAt the end of his final ''Tonight Show'' episode, Carson indicated that he might, if so inspired, return with a new project. Instead, he chose to go into full retirement, rarely giving interviews and declining to participate in NBC's 75th-anniversary celebrations. He made an occasional cameo appearance, including voicing himself on the May 13, 1993, episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (\"[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]\"), telephoning David Letterman on a November 1993 episode of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and appearing in the 1993 NBC special ''[[Bob Hope]]: The First 90 Years''.\n\nOn May 13, 1994, Carson appeared on the ''Late Show with David Letterman''. During a week of shows from Los Angeles, Letterman was having Larry \"Bud\" Melman ([[Calvert DeForest]]) deliver his \"Top Ten Lists\" under the guise that a famous personality would be delivering the list, instead. On the last show of the week, Letterman indicated that Carson would be delivering the list. Instead, DeForest delivered the list, insulted the audience (in keeping with the gag), and walked off to polite applause. Letterman then indicated that the card he was given did not have the proper list on it and asked that the \"real\" list be brought out. On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman's band played \"Johnny's Theme\"), an appearance that prompted a standing ovation from the audience. Carson then asked to sit behind Letterman's desk; Letterman obliged, as the audience continued to cheer and applaud. After some moments, Carson departed from the show without having spoken to the audience. He later cited acute [[laryngitis]] as the reason for his silence. This turned out to be Carson's last television appearance.\n\n=== Letterman ===\nJust days before Carson's death, ''The New York Times'' published a story revealing that he occasionally sent jokes to David Letterman.<ref>{{cite news | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Carson Feeds Letterman Lines | url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20%2C+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | accessdate=May 11, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714223159/http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/781543221.html?dids=781543221:781543221&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+20,+2005&author=Post+Wire+Services&pub=New+York+Post&edition=&startpage=102&desc=CARSON+FEEDS+LETTERMAN+LINES | archivedate=July 14, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Letterman would then use these jokes in the monologue of his show, which Carson got \"a big kick out of\", according to [[Worldwide Pants]] Inc.

Carson also donated to the Northeast Community College Lifelong Learning Center in honor of his favorite teacher, Miss Faye Gordon. Miss Gordon had appeared on his show a number of times. His last known visit to Norfolk was to throw the 100th-birthday party for Miss Gordon, which Carson had promised to do several years earlier.\n\nIn August 2010, the charitable foundation created by Johnny Carson reported receiving $156 million from a personal trust established by the entertainer years prior to his January 2005 death.

The unique way Sagan had of saying certain words, like \"billions\" of stars, would lead Carson to ribbing his friend, saying \"BILL-ions and BILL-ions\". Carson was the first person to contact Sagan's wife [[Ann Druyan]] with condolences when the scientist died in 1996. He owned several [[telescope]]s, including a top-of-the-line unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.company7.com/questar|title=Company Seven \u2013 Questar Products Index & Overview Page|date=November 2, 2012|work=company7.com}}</ref> In 1981, the [[minor planet]] 1981 EM<sub>4</sub> was named in his honor, [[Meanings of minor planet names: 3001\u20134000#252|3252 Johnny]].<ref>Wikipedia, [[List of minor planets: 3001\u20134000#252|List of minor planets.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=3252|title=Minor Planet Center: (3252) Johnny = 1981 EM4}}</ref>\n\nCarson was shown on a 1978 segment of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' practicing at home on a drum set given to him by close friend [[Buddy Rich]], who was the jazz musician with the most appearances on ''The Tonight Show''.
