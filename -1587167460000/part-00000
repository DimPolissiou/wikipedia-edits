{"title_page": "Technology acceptance model", "text_new": "[[File:Technology Acceptance Model.png|250px|thumb|The Technology Acceptance Model, version 1. ({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li J  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17226.93123 (preprint version)</ref> demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}). Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li J  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17226.93123 (preprint version)</ref> has demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}). Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> has also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

Two [[Roman legion|legions]] were deployed in the [[imperial province]] of '''\u00c6gyptus''' (Egypt) in the year 125.\n}}\nAs a key province, but also the 'crown domain' where the emperors succeeded the divine [[Pharaoh]]s, Egypt was ruled by a uniquely styled [[Praefectus augustalis]] ('Augustal prefect'), instead of the traditional senatorial governor of other [[Roman provinces]]. The prefect was a man of [[equestrian rank]] and was appointed by the Emperor. The first prefect of Aegyptus, [[Gaius Cornelius Gallus]], brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms, and established a [[protectorate]] over the southern frontier district, which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies.\n\nThe second prefect, [[Aelius Gallus]], made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer [[Arabia Petraea]] and even [[Arabia Felix]]. The [[Red Sea]] coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of [[Claudius]]. The third prefect, [[Gaius Petronius]], cleared the neglected canals for irrigation, stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central [[Sudan]] against the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]], whose [[Kandake|queen]] [[Amanirenas|Imanarenat]] had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of [[Napata]] to the ground and retreated to the north.\n\nFrom the reign of [[Nero]] onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the [[Jew]]s, particularly in [[Alexandria]], which after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture. Under [[Trajan]] a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]] occurred, resulting in the suppression of the Jews of Alexandria and the loss of all their privileges, although they soon returned. [[Hadrian]], who twice visited Aegyptus, founded [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] in memory of his drowned lover [[Antinous]]. From his reign onward buildings in the Greco-Roman style were erected throughout the country.\n\nUnder [[Antoninus Pius]] oppressive taxation led to a revolt in 139, of the native [[Egyptians]], which was suppressed only after several years of fighting. This Bucolic War, led by one [[Isidorus]], caused great damage to the economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline. [[Avidius Cassius]], who led the Roman forces in the war, declared himself emperor in 175, and was acknowledged by the armies of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and Aegyptus.\n\nOn the approach of Marcus Aurelius, Cassius was deposed and killed and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. A similar revolt broke out in 193, when [[Pescennius Niger]] was proclaimed emperor on the death of [[Pertinax]]. The Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] gave a constitution to Alexandria and the provincial capitals in 202.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Caracalla]] (211\u2013217) granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort more taxes, which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.\n\nThere was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under [[Decius]], in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, [[Mussius Aemilianus]], first supported the [[Macriani (disambiguation)|Macriani]], [[Gallienus usurpers|usurpers during the rule of Gallienus]], and later, in 261, became a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.\n\n[[Zenobia]], queen of [[Palmyra]], took the country away from the Romans when she conquered Aegyptus in 269, declaring herself the Queen of [[Egypt]] also. This warrior queen claimed that Egypt was an ancestral home of hers through a familial tie to [[Cleopatra VII]]. She was well educated and familiar with the culture of Egypt, its religion, and its language. She lost it later when the Roman emperor, [[Aurelian]], severed amicable relations between the two countries and retook Egypt in 274.\n\nTwo generals based in Aegyptus, [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] and [[Domitius Domitianus]], led successful revolts and made themselves emperors. [[Diocletian]] captured Alexandria from Domitius in 298 and reorganised the whole province. His edict of 303 against the Christians began a new era of persecution. This was the last serious attempt to stem the steady growth of Christianity in Egypt, however.\n\n== Roman government in Egypt ==\n{{Further|List of governors of Roman Egypt}}\n\nAs Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing [[revenue]]. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.\n\nThe reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in [[Egypt|Aegyptus]], at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the [[praeses]] and the [[dux]]. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.\n\nEmperor Justinian abolished the diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the [[dux]] with a civil deputy (the praeses) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local [[autonomy]] had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|450px|[[Indo-Roman trade and relations|Roman trade with India]] started from Aegyptus according to the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] (1st century).]]\nThe economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the [[Ptolemaic period]], but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated [[tax|taxation system]] was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.\n\nA massive amount of Aegyptus's grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of [[Alexandria]] and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.\n\nThe Roman government had actively encouraged the [[privatization]] of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.\n\nOverall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the [[village]] level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.\n\nBy the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage,<ref>{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Christiansen |title=Coinage in Roman Egypt: The Hoard Evidence |location= |publisher=Aarhus University Press |year=2004 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VkVmAAAAMAAJ }} }}</ref> and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the [[Committee|councils]] was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]].\n\n== Military ==\nThis wealthiest of provinces could be held militarily by a very small force; and the threat implicit in an embargo on the export of grain supplies, vital to the provisioning of the city of Rome and its populace, was obvious. Internal security was guaranteed by the presence of three Roman legions (later reduced to two, then one [[Legio II Traiana]]) stationed at the grand capital Alexandria. Each of these numbered around 5000 strong, and several units of auxiliaries.\n\nIn the first decade of Roman rule the spirit of Augustan imperialism looked farther afield, attempting expansion to the east and to the south. Most of the early Roman troops stationed there were Greco-Macedonians and native Egyptians once part of the dissolved Ptolemaic army finding service for Rome. Eventually Romans or Romanized people were a majority.\n\n== Social structure in early Roman Egypt ==\n{{See also|Fayum mummy portraits}}\n[[File:Egyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Citizen of Roman Egypt ([[Fayum mummy portrait]])]]\n[[File:Bust of Roman Nobleman, ca. 30 B.C.E.\u2013 50 C.E., 54.51.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Roman Nobleman, c. 30 BC\u201350 AD, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Egipto Hadrianeum.JPG|right|thumb|Possible depiction of the province of Egypt from the Hadrianeum in Rome]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Octavian Karnak.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Augustus]] wearing the [[nemes]] like Egyptian pharaohs.]] -->\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as \u201cEgyptians\u201d, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.<ref name=\"Oxyrhynchus and Rome, p.3\">{{cite journal |first=E.

Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions, many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Idris H. |last=Bell |title=Hellenic Culture in Egypt |journal=[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]] |volume=8 |issue=3/4 |year=1922 |pages=139\u2013155 [p. 148] |jstor=3853691 |doi=10.2307/3853691 }}</ref> The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. The Greeks were exempt from the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], while Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals were taxed at a lower rate than the native Egyptians, who could not enter the army, and paid the full poll tax.<ref>Bell, p.148</ref>\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century.  One element in particular was the appointment of [[strategoi]] to govern the \u2018[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s\u2019, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt.  [[Boulai]], or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by [[Septimius Severus]].  It was only under [[Diocletian]] later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on ''poros'' (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of metropolises.<ref>Lewis, p.141</ref> The city of [[Oxyrhynchus]] had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities.  This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.\n\nJust as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a [[deme]] that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with \u201c[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]]\u201d landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4\u20135 AD.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\">{{cite journal |first=E.

There was also the council of elders known as the [[gerousia]]. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\" /> These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, [[fellahin]]. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land.<ref>{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Delia |title=Alexandrian Citizenship During the Roman Principate |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |year=1991 |page=31 }}</ref>\n\nThese privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.<ref>Delia, pp.31\u201332</ref> Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoopolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria.<ref>Delia, p.32</ref>  All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.\n\nThe Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former master's social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.\n\n== Christian Egypt (33 AD\u20134th century) ==\n{{anchor|Christian Egypt}}\n{{History of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchate of Alexandria]] is traditionally held to be founded by [[Mark the Evangelist]] around 42. Evidence for a bishopric before the third century is however slight given the importance of the city's presbyters. Bishops often named their successors (e.g. Peter, his brother, by Athanasius in 373) or the succession was effected by imposing the hands of a deceased bishop on the one chosen to follow him. \n\nBy 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian [[apologist]]s [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated.\n\nWith the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] bitterly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at [[Philae]] in Upper Egypt proves worship of [[Isis]] persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.\n\nNo sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the [[Arianism|Arians]], named for the Alexandrian priest [[Arius]], and their opponents, represented by [[Athanasius]], who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the [[First Council of Nicaea]] rejected Arius's views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great [[Serapeum#Destruction of the Alexandrian Serapeum|temple of Serapis]], the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.\n\nPatristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions: Athanasius, Didymus the Blind and Cyril, and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius, Theophilus,  his nephew, Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros.\n\nEgypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Manichaeism]], either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the [[monasticism]] of the [[Desert Fathers]], who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.\n\nEgyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor [[Valens]] had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called [[Greek Magical Papyri]]. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.\n\nChristianity was quickly accepted by the people who were oppressed in first-century Roman Egypt. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia. <ref>History of Africa written by Kevin Shillington</ref>\n\n== Later Roman Egypt (4th\u20136th centuries) ==\n[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the Near East in 565, showing Byzantine Egypt and its neighbors.]]\n{{further|Diocese of Egypt}}\n\nThe reign of Constantine also saw the founding of [[Constantinople]] as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], known historiographically as the [[Byzantine Empire]], gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.\n\nThe [[Fall of Rome|fall of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome's culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The triumph of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.\n\nThe Eastern Empire became increasingly \"oriental\" in style as its links with the old Gr\u00e6co-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[patriarch of Alexandria]], convinced the city's governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews' alleged night-time massacre of many Christians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The murder of the philosopher [[Hypatia]] in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances  and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless [[papyrus]] finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels.\n\nThe new religious controversy was over the [[Christ]]'s human and divine nature. The issue was whether He had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one ([[hypostatic union]] from His humanity and divinity).  In an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The [[Miaphysite]] controversy arose after the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 and continued until well after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was \"one person in two natures\" as opposed to Monophysitism (a single nature).\n\n Monophysite belief was not held by the 'miaphysites' as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the \"Incarnate Logos of God\". Many of the 'miaphysites' claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position and the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\"</ref> Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.\n\nEgypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (527&ndash;565) saw the Empire recapture [[Rome]] and much of [[Italy]] from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire's eastern flank exposed.

From 619 - 628, [[Sasanian Egypt|they incorporated Egypt once again within their territories]], the previous (much longer) time being under the [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Achaemenids]]. [[Khosrow II]] Parv\u00eaz had begun [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|this war]] in retaliation for the assassination of Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582\u2013602) and had achieved a series of early successes, culminating in the conquests of [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|Jerusalem]] (614) and [[Siege of Alexandria (619)|Alexandria]] (619).\n\nA Byzantine counteroffensive launched by Emperor [[Heraclius]] in the spring of 622 shifted the advantage, and the war was brought to an end by the fall of Khosrow on 25 February 628 <ref>Frye, pp.&nbsp;167\u201370{{full|date=July 2019}}</ref>. The Egyptians had no love of the emperor in Constantinople and put up little resistance. Khosrow's son and successor, [[Kavadh II]] \u0160\u00ear\u00f4e (\u0160\u00ear\u00f4y), who reigned until September, concluded a peace treaty returning territories conquered by the Sassanids to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].\n\nThe Persian conquest allowed [[Miaphysitism]] to resurface in the open in Egypt, and when imperial rule was restored by Emperor Heraclius in 629, the Miaphysites were persecuted and their patriarch expelled. Egypt was thus in a state of both religious and political alienation from the Empire when a new invader appeared.\n\n== Arab Islamic conquest (639\u2013646 AD) ==\n[[File:Byzantiumby650AD.svg|thumb|450px|The Mediterranean world in 650, after the Arabs had conquered Egypt and Syria from the Byzantines.]]\n{{Main|Muslim conquest of Egypt}}\n\nAn army of 4,000 [[Arabs]] led by [[Amr Ibn Al-Aas]] was sent by the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]], successor to [[Muhammad(Prophet)]], to spread Islamic rule to the west. Arabs crossed into Egypt from Palestine in December 639, and advanced rapidly into the [[Nile Delta]]. The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more.\n\nThe Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|besieged and captured Alexandria]]. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back [[Alexandria]] in 645. The Muslims retook the city in 646, completing the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]. 40,000 civilians were evacuated to Constantinople with the imperial fleet. Thus ended 975 years of [[Greco-Roman]] rule over Egypt.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mummy Mask of a Man, early 1st century C.E.,72.57.jpg|Mummy Mask of a Man, early 1st century AD, 72.57, [[Brooklyn Museum]]\nFile:FuneraryMasksRomanEgypt.jpg|[[Death mask|Funerary masks]] uncovered in [[Faiyum]], 1st century.\nFile:As-Hadrian-Aegyptus-RIC 0839,As.jpg|[[Hadrian]] coin celebrating \u00c6gyptus Province, struck c. 135.

The prefect was a man of [[equestrian rank]] and was appointed by the Emperor. The first prefect of Aegyptus, [[Gaius Cornelius Gallus]], brought Upper Egypt under Roman control by force of arms, and established a [[protectorate]] over the southern frontier district, which had been abandoned by the later Ptolemies.\n\nThe second prefect, [[Aelius Gallus]], made an unsuccessful expedition to conquer [[Arabia Petraea]] and even [[Arabia Felix]]. The [[Red Sea]] coast of Aegyptus was not brought under Roman control until the reign of [[Claudius]]. The third prefect, [[Gaius Petronius]], cleared the neglected canals for irrigation, stimulating a revival of agriculture. Petronius even led a campaign into present-day central [[Sudan]] against the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]], whose [[Kandake|queen]] [[Amanirenas|Imanarenat]] had previously attacked Roman Egypt. Failing to acquire permanent gains, in 22 BC he razed the city of [[Napata]] to the ground and retreated to the north.\n\nFrom the reign of [[Nero]] onward, Aegyptus enjoyed an era of prosperity which lasted a century. Much trouble was caused by religious conflicts between the Greeks and the [[Jew]]s, particularly in [[Alexandria]], which after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] in 70 became the world centre of Jewish religion and culture. Under [[Trajan]] a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]] occurred, resulting in the suppression of the Jews of Alexandria and the loss of all their privileges, although they soon returned. [[Hadrian]], who twice visited Aegyptus, founded [[Antinopolis|Antino\u00f6polis]] in memory of his drowned lover [[Antinous]]. From his reign onward buildings in the Greco-Roman style were erected throughout the country.\n\nUnder [[Antoninus Pius]] oppressive taxation led to a revolt in 139, of the native [[Egyptians]], which was suppressed only after several years of fighting. This Bucolic War, led by one [[Isidorus]], caused great damage to the economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline. [[Avidius Cassius]], who led the Roman forces in the war, declared himself emperor in 175, and was acknowledged by the armies of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and Aegyptus.\n\nOn the approach of Marcus Aurelius, Cassius was deposed and killed and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. A similar revolt broke out in 193, when [[Pescennius Niger]] was proclaimed emperor on the death of [[Pertinax]]. The Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] gave a constitution to Alexandria and the provincial capitals in 202.{{clarify|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Caracalla]] (211\u2013217) granted Roman citizenship to all Egyptians, in common with the other provincials, but this was mainly to extort more taxes, which grew increasingly onerous as the needs of the emperors for more revenue grew more desperate.\n\nThere was a series of revolts, both military and civilian, through the 3rd century. Under [[Decius]], in 250, the Christians again suffered from persecution, but their religion continued to spread. The prefect of Aegyptus in 260, [[Mussius Aemilianus]], first supported the [[Macriani (disambiguation)|Macriani]], [[Gallienus usurpers|usurpers during the rule of Gallienus]], and later, in 261, became a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] himself, but was defeated by Gallienus.\n\n[[Zenobia]], queen of [[Palmyra]], took the country away from the Romans when she conquered Aegyptus in 269, declaring herself the Queen of [[Egypt]] also. This warrior queen claimed that Egypt was an ancestral home of hers through a familial tie to [[Cleopatra VII]]. She was well educated and familiar with the culture of Egypt, its religion, and its language. She lost it later when the Roman emperor, [[Aurelian]], severed amicable relations between the two countries and retook Egypt in 274.\n\nTwo generals based in Aegyptus, [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] and [[Domitius Domitianus]], led successful revolts and made themselves emperors. [[Diocletian]] captured Alexandria from Domitius in 298 and reorganised the whole province. His edict of 303 against the Christians began a new era of persecution. This was the last serious attempt to stem the steady growth of Christianity in Egypt, however.\n\n== Roman government in Egypt ==\n{{Further|List of governors of Roman Egypt}}\n\nAs Rome overtook the Ptolemaic system in place for areas of Egypt, they made many changes. The effect of the Roman conquest was at first to strengthen the position of the Greeks and of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] against Egyptian influences. Some of the previous offices and names of offices under the Hellenistic Ptolemaic rule were kept, some were changed, and some names would have remained but the function and administration would have changed.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire|Romans]] introduced important changes in the administrative system, aimed at achieving a high level of efficiency and maximizing [[revenue]]. The duties of the prefect of Aegyptus combined responsibility for military security through command of the [[Roman legion|legion]]s and [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]], for the organization of finance and taxation, and for the administration of justice.\n\nThe reforms of the early 4th century had established the basis for another 250 years of comparative prosperity in [[Egypt|Aegyptus]], at a cost of perhaps greater rigidity and more oppressive state control. Aegyptus was subdivided for administrative purposes into a number of smaller provinces, and separate civil and military officials were established; the [[praeses]] and the [[dux]]. The province was under the supervision of the count of the Orient (i.e. the vicar) of the diocese headquartered in Antioch in Syria.\n\nEmperor Justinian abolished the diocese of Egypt in 538 and re-combined civil and military power in the hands of the [[dux]] with a civil deputy (the praeses) as a counterweight to the power of the church authorities. All pretense of local [[autonomy]] had by then vanished. The presence of the soldiery was more noticeable, its power and influence more pervasive in the routine of town and village life.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|thumb|450px|[[Indo-Roman trade and relations|Roman trade with India]] started from Aegyptus according to the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] (1st century).]]\nThe economic resources that this imperial government existed to exploit had not changed since the [[Ptolemaic period]], but the development of a much more complex and sophisticated [[tax|taxation system]] was a hallmark of Roman rule. Taxes in both cash and kind were assessed on land, and a bewildering variety of small taxes in cash, as well as customs dues and the like, was collected by appointed officials.\n\nA massive amount of Aegyptus's grain was shipped downriver (north) both to feed the population of [[Alexandria]] and for export to the Roman capital. There were frequent complaints of oppression and extortion from the taxpayers.\n\nThe Roman government had actively encouraged the [[privatization]] of land and the increase of private enterprise in manufacture, commerce, and trade, and low tax rates favored private owners and entrepreneurs. The poorer people gained their livelihood as tenants of state-owned land or of property belonging to the emperor or to wealthy private landlords, and they were relatively much more heavily burdened by rentals, which tended to remain at a fairly high level.\n\nOverall, the degree of monetization and complexity in the economy, even at the [[village]] level, was intense. Goods were moved around and exchanged through the medium of coin on a large scale and, in the towns and the larger villages, a high level of industrial and commercial activity developed in close conjunction with the exploitation of the predominant agricultural base. The volume of trade, both internal and external, reached its peak in the 1st and 2nd centuries.\n\nBy the end of the 3rd century, major problems were evident. A series of debasements of the imperial currency had undermined confidence in the coinage,<ref>{{cite book |first=Erik |last=Christiansen |title=Coinage in Roman Egypt: The Hoard Evidence |location= |publisher=Aarhus University Press |year=2004 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=VkVmAAAAMAAJ }} }}</ref> and even the government itself was contributing to this by demanding more and more irregular tax payments in kind, which it channeled directly to the main consumers, the army personnel. Local administration by the [[Committee|councils]] was careless, recalcitrant, and inefficient; the evident need for firm and purposeful reform had to be squarely faced in the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]].\n\n== Military ==\nThis wealthiest of provinces could be held militarily by a very small force; and the threat implicit in an embargo on the export of grain supplies, vital to the provisioning of the city of Rome and its populace, was obvious. Internal security was guaranteed by the presence of three Roman legions (later reduced to two, then one [[Legio II Traiana]]) stationed at the grand capital Alexandria. Each of these numbered around 5000 strong, and several units of auxiliaries.\n\nIn the first decade of Roman rule the spirit of Augustan imperialism looked farther afield, attempting expansion to the east and to the south. Most of the early Roman troops stationed there were Greco-Macedonians and native Egyptians once part of the dissolved Ptolemaic army finding service for Rome. Eventually Romans or Romanized people were a majority.\n\n== Social structure in early Roman Egypt ==\n{{See also|Fayum mummy portraits}}\n[[File:Egyptian - Mummy Portrait of a Man - Walters 323.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Citizen of Roman Egypt ([[Fayum mummy portrait]])]]\n[[File:Bust of Roman Nobleman, ca. 30 B.C.E.\u2013 50 C.E., 54.51.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Roman Nobleman, c. 30 BC\u201350 AD, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n[[File:Egipto Hadrianeum.JPG|right|thumb|Possible depiction of the province of Egypt from the Hadrianeum in Rome]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Octavian Karnak.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A depiction of [[Augustus]] wearing the [[nemes]] like Egyptian pharaohs.]] -->\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus under the Romans was both unique and complicated. On the one hand, the Romans continued to use many of the same organizational tactics that were in place under the leaders of the Ptolemaic period. At the same time, the Romans saw the Greeks in Aegyptus as \u201cEgyptians\u201d, an idea that both the native Egyptians and Greeks would have rejected.<ref name=\"Oxyrhynchus and Rome, p.3\">{{cite journal |first=E.

Other than Roman citizens, a Greek citizen of one of the Greek cities had the highest status, and a rural Egyptian would be in the lowest class.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Alston |title=Philo's In Flaccum: Ethnicity and Social Space in Roman Alexandria |journal=Greece and Rome |series=Second Series |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=165\u2013175 [p. 166] |doi=10.1093/gr/44.2.165 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/958c32b3dd2c4b85c4c217ca9b9762fa7510e26a }}</ref> In between those classes was the metropolite, who was almost certainly of Hellenic origin.

Although only Roman citizens could serve in the legions, many Greeks found their way in. The native Egyptians could join the auxiliary forces and attain citizenship upon discharge.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Idris H. |last=Bell |title=Hellenic Culture in Egypt |journal=[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]] |volume=8 |issue=3/4 |year=1922 |pages=139\u2013155 [p. 148] |jstor=3853691 |doi=10.2307/3853691 }}</ref> The different groups had different rates of taxation based on their social class. The Greeks were exempt from the [[Tax per head|poll tax]], while Hellenized inhabitants of the nome capitals were taxed at a lower rate than the native Egyptians, who could not enter the army, and paid the full poll tax.<ref>Bell, p.148</ref>\n\nThe social structure in Aegyptus is very closely linked to the governing administration. Elements of centralized rule that were derived from the Ptolemaic period lasted into the 4th century.  One element in particular was the appointment of [[strategoi]] to govern the \u2018[[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]s\u2019, the traditional administrative divisions of Egypt.  [[Boulai]], or town councils, in Egypt were only formally constituted by [[Septimius Severus]].  It was only under [[Diocletian]] later in the 3rd century that these boulai and their officers acquired important administrative responsibilities for their nomes. The Augustan takeover introduced a system of compulsory public service, which was based on ''poros'' (property or income qualification), which was wholly based on social status and power. The Romans also introduced the poll tax which was similar to tax rates that the Ptolemies levied, but the Romans gave special low rates to citizens of metropolises.<ref>Lewis, p.141</ref> The city of [[Oxyrhynchus]] had many papyri remains that contain much information on the subject of social structure in these cities.  This city, along with Alexandria, shows the diverse set-up of various institutions that the Romans continued to use after their takeover of Egypt.\n\nJust as under the Ptolemies, Alexandria and its citizens had their own special designations. The capital city enjoyed a higher status and more privileges than the rest of Egypt. Just as it was under the Ptolemies, the primary way of becoming a citizen of Roman Alexandria was through showing when registering for a [[deme]] that both parents were Alexandrian citizens. Alexandrians were the only Egyptians that could obtain Roman citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |first=A. N. |last=Sherwin-White |title=The Roman Citizenship |url=https://archive.org/details/romancitizenship0000sher |url-access=registration |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/romancitizenship0000sher/page/391 391] |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIf a common Egyptian wanted to become a Roman citizen he would first have to become an Alexandrian citizen. The Augustan period in Egypt saw the creation of urban communities with \u201c[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]]\u201d landowning elites. These landowning elites were put in a position of privilege and power and had more self-administration than the Egyptian population. Within the citizenry, there were gymnasiums that Greek citizens could enter if they showed that both parents were members of the gymnasium based on a list that was compiled by the government in 4\u20135 AD.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\">{{cite journal |first=E. G. |last=Turner |title=Roman Oxyrhynchus |journal=[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]] |volume=38 |issue= |pages=78\u201393 [p. 84] |jstor=3855498 |year=1952 |doi=10.1177/030751335203800110 }}</ref>\n\nThe candidate for the gymnasium would then be let into the [[ephebus]]. There was also the council of elders known as the [[gerousia]]. This council of elders did not have a boulai to answer to. All of this Greek organization was a vital part of the metropolis and the Greek institutions provided an elite group of citizens. The Romans looked to these elites to provide municipal officers and well-educated administrators.<ref name=\"Roman Oxyrhynchus, p. 84\" /> These elites also paid lower poll-taxes than the local native Egyptians, [[fellahin]]. It is well documented that Alexandrians in particular were able to enjoy lower tax-rates on land.<ref>{{cite book |first=Diana |last=Delia |title=Alexandrian Citizenship During the Roman Principate |location=Atlanta |publisher=Scholars Press |year=1991 |page=31 }}</ref>\n\nThese privileges even extended to corporal punishments. Romans were protected from this type of punishment while native Egyptians were whipped. Alexandrians, on the other hand, had the privilege of merely being beaten with a rod.<ref>Delia, pp.31\u201332</ref> Although Alexandria enjoyed the greatest status of the Greek cities in Egypt, it is clear that the other Greek cities, such as Antinoopolis, enjoyed privileges very similar to the ones seen in Alexandria.<ref>Delia, p.32</ref>  All of these changes amounted to the Greeks being treated as an ally in Egypt and the native Egyptians were treated as a conquered race.\n\nThe Gnomon of the Idios Logos shows the connection between law and status. It lays out the revenues it deals with, mainly fines and confiscation of property, to which only a few groups were apt. The Gnomon also confirms that a freed slave takes his former master's social status. The Gnomon demonstrates the social controls that the Romans had in place through monetary means based on status and property.\n\n== Christian Egypt (33 AD\u20134th century) ==\n{{anchor|Christian Egypt}}\n{{History of Egypt}}\n\nThe [[patriarch of Alexandria|Patriarchate of Alexandria]] is traditionally held to be founded by [[Mark the Evangelist]] around 42. Evidence for a bishopric before the third century is however slight given the importance of the city's presbyters. Bishops often named their successors (e.g. Peter, his brother, by Athanasius in 373) or the succession was effected by imposing the hands of a deceased bishop on the one chosen to follow him. \n\nBy 200 it is clear that Alexandria was one of the great Christian centres. The Christian [[apologist]]s [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Origen]] both lived part or all of their lives in that city, where they wrote, taught, and debated.\n\nWith the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] ended the persecution of Christians. Over the course of the 5th century, paganism was suppressed and lost its following, as the poet [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]] bitterly noted. It lingered underground for many decades: the final edict against paganism was issued in 435, but graffiti at [[Philae]] in Upper Egypt proves worship of [[Isis]] persisted at its temples into the 6th century. Many Egyptian Jews also became Christians, but many others refused to do so, leaving them as the only sizable religious minority in a Christian country.\n\nNo sooner had the Egyptian Church achieved freedom and supremacy than it became subject to a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] and prolonged conflict which at times descended into civil war. Alexandria became the centre of the first great split in the Christian world, between the [[Arianism|Arians]], named for the Alexandrian priest [[Arius]], and their opponents, represented by [[Athanasius]], who became Archbishop of Alexandria in 326 after the [[First Council of Nicaea]] rejected Arius's views. The Arian controversy caused years of riots and rebellions throughout most of the 4th century. In the course of one of these, the great [[Serapeum#Destruction of the Alexandrian Serapeum|temple of Serapis]], the stronghold of paganism, was destroyed. Athanasius was alternately expelled from Alexandria and reinstated as its Archbishop between five and seven times.\n\nPatristic authorship was dominated by Egyptian contributions: Athanasius, Didymus the Blind and Cyril, and the power of the Alexandrian see embodied in Athanasius, Theophilus,  his nephew, Cyril and shortly by Dioscuros.\n\nEgypt had an ancient tradition of religious speculation, enabling a variety of controversial religious views to thrive there. Not only did Arianism flourish, but other doctrines, such as [[Gnosticism]] and [[Manichaeism]], either native or imported, found many followers. Another religious development in Egypt was the [[monasticism]] of the [[Desert Fathers]], who renounced the material world in order to live a life of poverty in devotion to the Church.\n\nEgyptian Christians took up monasticism with such enthusiasm that the Emperor [[Valens]] had to restrict the number of men who could become monks. Egypt exported monasticism to the rest of the Christian world. Another development of this period was the development of [[Coptic language|Coptic]], a form of the Ancient Egyptian language written with the Greek alphabet supplemented by several signs to represent sounds present in Egyptian which were not present in Greek. It was invented to ensure the correct pronunciation of magical words and names in pagan texts, the so-called [[Greek Magical Papyri]]. Coptic was soon adopted by early Christians to spread the word of the gospel to native Egyptians and it became the liturgical language of Egyptian Christianity and remains so to this day.\n\nChristianity was quickly accepted by the people who were oppressed in first-century Roman Egypt. Christianity eventually spread out west to the Berbers. The Coptic Church was established in Egypt. Since Christianity blended with local traditions it never truly united the people against Arabian forces in the seventh and eight centuries. Later on in the seventh and eighth centuries, Christianity spread out to Nubia. <ref>History of Africa written by Kevin Shillington</ref>\n\n== Later Roman Egypt (4th\u20136th centuries) ==\n[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|450px|A map of the Near East in 565, showing Byzantine Egypt and its neighbors.]]\n{{further|Diocese of Egypt}}\n\nThe reign of Constantine also saw the founding of [[Constantinople]] as a new capital for the Roman Empire, and in the course of the 4th century the Empire was divided in two, with Egypt finding itself in the Eastern Empire with its capital at Constantinople. Latin, never well established in Egypt, would play a declining role with Greek continuing to be the dominant language of government and scholarship. During the 5th and 6th centuries the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], known historiographically as the [[Byzantine Empire]], gradually transformed itself into a thoroughly Christian state whose culture differed significantly from its pagan past.\n\nThe [[Fall of Rome|fall of the Western Empire]] in the 5th century further isolated the Egyptian Romans from Rome's culture and hastened the growth of Christianity. The triumph of Christianity led to a virtual abandonment of pharaonic traditions: with the disappearance of the Egyptian priests and priestesses who officiated at the temples, no-one could read the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] of Pharaonic Egypt, and its temples were converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.\n\nThe Eastern Empire became increasingly \"oriental\" in style as its links with the old Gr\u00e6co-Roman world faded. The Greek system of local government by citizens had now entirely disappeared. Offices, with new Byzantine names, were almost hereditary in the wealthy land-owning families. Alexandria, the second city of the empire, continued to be a centre of religious controversy and violence.\n\n[[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], the [[patriarch of Alexandria]], convinced the city's governor to expel the Jews from the city in 415 with the aid of the mob, in response to the Jews' alleged night-time massacre of many Christians. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The murder of the philosopher [[Hypatia]] in March 415 marked a dramatic turn in classical Hellenic culture in Egypt but philosophy thrived in sixth century Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Another schism in the Church produced prolonged disturbances  and may have alienated Egypt from the Empire. The countless [[papyrus]] finds mark the continuance of Greek culture and institutions at various levels.\n\nThe new religious controversy was over the [[Christ]]'s human and divine nature. The issue was whether He had two natures, human and divine, or a combined one ([[hypostatic union]] from His humanity and divinity).  In an intensely religious age it was enough to divide an empire. The [[Miaphysite]] controversy arose after the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 and continued until well after the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, which ruled in favour of the position that Christ was \"one person in two natures\" as opposed to Monophysitism (a single nature).\n\n Monophysite belief was not held by the 'miaphysites' as they stated that Jesus was out of two natures in one nature called, the \"Incarnate Logos of God\". Many of the 'miaphysites' claimed that they were misunderstood, that there was really no difference between their position and the Chalcedonian position, and that the Council of Chalcedon ruled against them because of political motivations alone. The Church of Alexandria split from the Churches of Rome and Constantinople over this issue, creating what would become the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which remains a major force in Egyptian religious life today.<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |title=Egypt |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=2011-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220145046/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/egypt |archive-date=2011-12-20 |url-status=dead }} See drop-down essay on \"Islamic Conquest and the Ottoman Empire\"</ref> Egypt and Syria remained hotbeds of Miaphysite sentiment, and organised resistance to the Chalcedonian view was not suppressed until the 570s.\n\nEgypt nevertheless continued to be an important economic center for the Empire supplying much of its agriculture and manufacturing needs as well as continuing to be an important center of scholarship. It would supply the needs of the Byzantine Empire and the Mediterranean as a whole. The reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (527&ndash;565) saw the Empire recapture [[Rome]] and much of [[Italy]] from the barbarians, but these successes left the empire's eastern flank exposed.

The Imperial garrisons retreated into the walled towns, where they successfully held out for a year or more.\n\nThe Arabs sent for reinforcements, and in April 641 they [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|besieged and captured Alexandria]]. The Byzantines assembled a fleet with the aim of recapturing Egypt, and won back [[Alexandria]] in 645.

Henry is best known for [[Wives of Henry VIII|his six marriages]], and in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage (to [[Catherine of Aragon]]) annulled. His disagreement with [[Pope Clement VII]] on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the [[English Reformation]], separating the [[Church of England]] from papal authority. He appointed himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and [[dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved convents and monasteries]], for which he was [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church|excommunicated]]. Henry is also known as \"the father of the Royal Navy,\" as he invested heavily in the navy, increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships, and established the [[Navy Board]].\n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the [[History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]], ushering in the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign. He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]]. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Thomas More]], [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]] all figured prominently in his administration.\n\nHenry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the [[Reformation]] Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful wars, particularly with King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], [[James V of Scotland]] and the Scottish regency under the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Earl of Arran]] and [[Mary of Guise]].

The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable.<ref name=\"loades6869\" /> Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=69}}</ref> A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles [[Battle of Pavia|defeated and captured Francis at Pavia]] and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing.

These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would take the intervention of the pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death; or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigden|2000|p=114}}</ref> It was a decision that would lead Henry to reject papal authority and initiate the [[English Reformation]].\n\n[[File:1491 Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry, c. 1531]]\n\nHenry's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> Henry himself, at least in the early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication ''[[Assertio Septem Sacramentorum]]'' (\"Defence of the Seven Sacraments\") earned him the title of ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith) from Pope [[Leo X]].<ref name=\"elton75\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms.<ref name=\"elton75\" /> It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to [[Leviticus]] 20:21,<ref group=\"nb\">Although Henry would have read the verse in its Latin (vulgate) form, the translation used in the 1604 King James Bible is instructive: \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless\".</ref> an [[Affinity (canon law)|impediment]] Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> Henry sent his secretary, [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], to appeal directly to the [[Holy See]] by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull.

Though Clement agreed to the creation of such a court, he never had any intention of empowering his legate, [[Lorenzo Campeggio]], to decide in Henry's favour.<ref name=\"Elton109\" /> This bias was perhaps the result of pressure from [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Catherine's nephew, though it is not clear how far this influenced either Campeggio or the Pope.

The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a [[false pregnancy]] or [[miscarriage]] in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1971|p=138}}</ref> Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with [[Margaret and Mary Shelton|Margaret (\"Madge\") Shelton]] in 1535, although historian [[Antonia Fraser]] argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister [[Mary Shelton]].<ref name=\"Fraser1994\" />\n\nOpposition to Henry's religious policies was quickly suppressed in England.

The most prominent resisters included [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, both of whom refused to take the oath to the King.<ref name=\"elton192\" /> Neither Henry nor Cromwell sought to have the men executed; rather, they hoped that the two might change their minds and save themselves. Fisher openly rejected Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church, but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the [[Treasons Act 1534|Treasons Act of 1534]], which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however \u2013 More on the evidence of a single conversation with [[Richard Rich]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]].

In 1536, for example, Henry granted his assent to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|Laws in Wales Act 1535]], which legally annexed [[Wales]], uniting England and Wales into a single nation. This was followed by the [[Second Succession Act]] (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne.

With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian War]] in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=75}}</ref> In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful [[James V of Scotland|James V]].

The Scottish Regent [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Lord Arran]] agreed to the marriage in the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the [[Rough Wooing]]\".

Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]]. The other, under Suffolk, [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)#First siege|laid siege to Boulogne]].

The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (\u00a3750,000).

Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 [[executor]]s to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18. The executors chose [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be [[Lord Protector]] of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret&nbsp;\u2013 the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 were thereby excluded from the succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=332\u2013333}}</ref> This final provision failed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became King of England in 1603.\n\n== Public image ==\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|left|Musical score of \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\", c. 1513, composed by Henry]]\nHenry cultivated the image of a [[Renaissance man]], and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].

Musicians included [[Benedict de Opitiis]], [[Richard Sampson]], [[Ambrose Lupo]], and Venetian organist [[Dionisio Memo]],<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" /> and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments.

He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety.<ref name=\"Crofton2006a\" /> He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]], and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nHenry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's ''Oratio'' (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Chibi|1997|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref> At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Betteridge|2005|pp=91\u2013109}}</ref> Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nHenry was a large, well-built athlete, over {{convert|6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} tall, strong, and broad in proportion, and he excelled at jousting and hunting. These were more than pastimes; they were political devices which served multiple goals, enhancing his athletic royal image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchinson|2012|p=202}}</ref> Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him. His health rapidly declined near the end of his reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunn|1991|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2005|pp=41\u201359}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lipscomb|2009|p = }}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, [[Divine right of kings|by the grace of God]] alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|1997|p=78}}</ref> The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the [[royal prerogative]].

This fortune was estimated to be \u00a31,250,000 (\u00a3375&nbsp;million by today's standards).<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=13}}</ref> By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=215\u2013216,&nbsp;355\u20136}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this wealth was spent by Henry on maintaining his court and household, including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|hung just 200]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2005|pp=79\u201380}} citing {{harvnb|Thurley|1993|pp=222\u2013224}}</ref> Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 [[Handgun#Single-shot pistols|handguns]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2005|pp=11\u201329}}</ref> Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like [[tonnage and poundage]], granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around \u00a3100,000),<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=64}}</ref> but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.\n\nWhereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth \u00a3120,000 (\u00a336&nbsp;million) a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=393}}</ref> The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=312\u2013314}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformation ===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n[[File:King Henry VIII of England and Pope Clement VII.jpg|thumb|King Henry VIII sitting with his feet upon Pope Clement VI, 1641]]\n\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation \u2013 the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one \u2013 though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |accessdate=14 April 2013 |year=1997 |title=Competing Narratives: Recent Historiography of the English Reformation under Henry VIII |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615214144/http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |archivedate=15 June 2013  }}</ref> and the precise narrative not widely agreed.<ref name=\"elton103\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=103\u2013107}}</ref> Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy.<ref name=\"elton110\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=110\u2013112}}</ref> The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of [[papal supremacy]] (which he had previously defended), though as historian [[A. F. Pollard]] has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|1905|pp=230\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent [[Church of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=missing}}</ref> These included the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] (passed 1533), which extended the charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty.<ref name=\"bernard71\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=71}}</ref> Other acts included the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and the [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The [[Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534]] required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the King as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath;<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=185}}</ref> those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty.<ref name=\"bernard2005\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Finally, the [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your [[His Grace|Grace]]\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmberg|1970|p=missing}}</ref> The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=195}}</ref>\n\nHenry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the [[Act of Six Articles]], whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.<ref name=\"elton289\" /> It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed [[liturgy]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which would take until 1549 to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=291}}</ref> The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=297}}</ref> Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new [[political theology]] of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected [[Martin Luther]]'s new interpretation of the [[Ten commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|fourth commandment]] (\"Honour thy father and mother\"), brought to England by [[William Tyndale]]. The founding of royal authority on the [[Ten Commandments]] was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the ''[[Great Bible]]'' in 1539 in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Rex|1996|pp=863\u2013894}}</ref> Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale,<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=3177}}</ref> who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.\n\nWhen taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=233}}</ref> In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=233\u2013234}}</ref> In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced [[dissolution of the monasteries]] with all religious houses worth less than \u00a3200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some \u00a390,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=235\u2013236}}</ref> The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=236\u2013237}}</ref> Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently.<ref>{{harvnb|St\u00f6ber|2007|p=190}}</ref> Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=238}}</ref>\n\nResponse to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=254\u2013256}}</ref> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536\u20131537, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=269\u2013272}}</ref> Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553\u20131558).\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509\u201347) MET DT205963.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry's Italian-made suit of armour, c. 1544.

When [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond]] died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Surrey's ambitious aims were costly, but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Surrey was recalled in 1521, with [[Piers Butler]] \u2013 one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond \u2013 appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the [[James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond|Earl of Desmond]], an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=185\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529, which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and the king's son, as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland, his appointment a break with past policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes, but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"loades187\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=187}}</ref> Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell, who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare, on the other hand, was summoned to London; after some hesitation, he departed for London in 1534, where he would face charges of treason.<ref name=\"loades187\" /> His son, [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Thomas, Lord Offaly]] was more forthright, denouncing the king and leading a \"Catholic crusade\" against the king, who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered, and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes, although he failed to secure the support of [[Lord Darcy]], a sympathiser, or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2,000 English troops \u2013 a large army by Irish standards \u2013 and the execution of Offaly (his father was already dead) and his uncles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=187\u2013189}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir [[Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)|Antony St Leger]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who would remain into the post past Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=191}}</ref> Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] free from the Papal [[Lord|overlordship]]. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref> The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe complexities and sheer scale of Henry's legacy ensured that, in the words of Betteridge and Freeman, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" />  Historian J.D. Mackie sums up Henry's personality and its impact on his achievements and popularity:\n\n{{quote|The respect, nay even the popularity, which he had from his people was not unmerited....He kept the development of England in line with some of the most vigorous, though not the noblest forces of the day.  His high courage \u2013 highest when things went ill \u2013 his commanding intellect, his appreciation of fact, and his instinct for rule carried his country through a perilous time of change, and his very arrogance saved his people from the wars which afflicted other lands. Dimly remembering the wars of the Roses, vaguely informed as to the slaughters and sufferings in Europe, the people of England knew that in Henry they had a great king.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.D.

Pollard]], who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king,  lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953.\n\nElton's book on ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'', maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd, but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=23,332}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of [[Jack Scarisbrick|J. J. Scarisbrick]], his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1968|p=17}}</ref> The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Even among more recent biographers, including [[David Loades]], [[David Starkey]] and [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.<ref name=\"bandf1\" />\n\nThis lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change.<ref name=\"morris19\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]], for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|p=passim}}</ref>\n\n== Style and arms ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Coat of Arms of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547).svg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Coat of Arms of England (1509-1554).svg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's armorial during his early reign (left) and later reign (right)\n}}\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Lord of Ireland]]\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his ''Defence of the Seven Sacraments'', the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[35 Hen 8]] c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Beaufort portcullis]]. As king, Henry's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by his predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lys]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)''.\n\nIn 1535, Henry added the \"supremacy phrase\" to the royal style, which became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head\". In 1536, the phrase \"of the Church of England\" changed to \"of the Church of England and also of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]]\". In 1541, Henry had the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] change the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" with the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King [[Henry II of England]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrats. The style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| ref=<ref>{{cite book |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy |publisher=Vintage Books |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-09-953973-5 |chapter=The Tudors}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| 1 = 1.

Henry is best known for [[Wives of Henry VIII|his six marriages]], in particular his efforts to have his first marriage (to [[Catherine of Aragon]]) annulled. His disagreement with [[Pope Clement VII]] on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the [[English Reformation]], separating the [[Church of England]] from papal authority. He appointed himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and [[dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved convents and monasteries]], for which he was [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church|excommunicated]]. Henry is also known as \"the father of the Royal Navy,\" as he invested heavily in the navy, increasing its size from a few to more than 50 ships, and established the [[Navy Board]].\n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the [[History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]], ushering in the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. He also greatly expanded royal power during his reign. He frequently used charges of treason and heresy to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial by means of [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]]. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Thomas More]], [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]] all figured prominently in his administration.\n\nHenry was an extravagant spender, using the proceeds from the dissolution of the monasteries and acts of the [[Reformation]] Parliament. He also converted the money that was formerly paid to Rome into royal revenue. Despite the money from these sources, he was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance, as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful wars, particularly with King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], [[James V of Scotland]] and the Scottish regency under the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Earl of Arran]] and [[Mary of Guise]]. At home, he oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], and he was the first English monarch to rule as King of Ireland following the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]].\n\nHenry's contemporaries considered him an attractive, educated, and accomplished king. He has been described as \"one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne\".<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2000|p=41}}.</ref> He was an author and composer. As he aged, however, he became severely obese and his health suffered, contributing to his death in 1547. He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful, egotistical, harsh, and insecure king.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2006|pp=28\u201336}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Edward VI]].\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Vaux Passional (f.9).

He was subsequently appointed [[Earl Marshal]] of England and [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] at age three, and was made a [[Knight of the Bath]] soon after. The day after the ceremony he was created [[Duke of York]] and a month or so later made [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the Scottish Marches]]. In May 1495, he was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]]. The reason for all the appointments to a small child was so his father could keep personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> Henry was given a first-rate education from leading tutors, becoming fluent in Latin and French, and learning at least some Italian.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1966|p=24}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Not much is known about his early life \u2013 save for his appointments \u2013 because he was not expected to become king.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> In November 1501, Henry also played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=4}}</ref> As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a ''label of three points ermine''. He was further honoured, on 9 February 1506, by [[Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]] who made him a [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knight of the Golden Fleece]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume III|year=1912|editor-last=Gibbs|editor-first=Vicary|page=443|publisher=St Catherine's Press}}Under Duke of Cornwall, which was his title when he succeeded his brother as Prince of Wales.</ref>\n\nIn 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of [[sweating sickness]],<ref>{{harvnb|Maloney|2015|page=96}}</ref> just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\">{{harvnb|Crofton|2006|p=126}}</ref> Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother, the 10-year-old Henry. After a little debate, Henry became the new [[Duke of Cornwall]] in October 1502, and the new [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] in February 1503.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Henry VII gave the boy few tasks. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=6}}</ref>\n\nHenry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his second son in marriage to Arthur's widow Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\" /> Both Isabella and Henry VII were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.<ref name=\"loades22\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=22}}</ref> On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=8}}</ref> A [[papal dispensation]] was only needed for the \"impediment of public honesty\" if the marriage had not been [[consummated]] as Catherine and her [[duenna]] claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \"affinity\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /> Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.<ref name=\"loades22\" /> Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], complicated matters. Her father preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.<ref name=\"Loades2009\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=23}}</ref>\n\n== Early reign ==\n[[File:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|thumb|upright|Eighteen-year-old Henry VIII after his [[coronation]] in 1509]]\nHenry VII died on 21 April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the [[dowry|marriage portion]].<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /><ref name=\"loades24\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=24}}</ref> The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine.<ref name=\"Loades2009\" /> Whether or not this was true, it was certainly convenient. [[Emperor Maximilian I]] had been attempting to marry his granddaughter (and Catherine's niece) [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to Henry; she had now been jilted.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=12}}</ref> Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friar's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509.<ref name=\"loades24\" /> On 23 June 1509, Henry led the now 23-year-old Catherine from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Westminster Abbey]] for their coronation, which took place the following day.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> It was a grand affair: the king's passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\" /> Following the ceremony, there was a grand banquet in [[Westminster Hall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=19}}</ref> As Catherine wrote to her father, \"our time is spent in continuous festival\".<ref name=\"loades24\" />\n\nTwo days after his coronation, Henry arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]. They were charged with [[treason|high treason]] and were executed in 1510. Politically-motivated executions would remain one of Henry's primary tactics for dealing with those who stood in his way.<ref name=\"Crofton2006\" /> Henry also returned to the public some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1904|p=17}}</ref> By contrast, Henry's view of the [[House of York]] \u2013 potential rival claimants for the throne \u2013 was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset|Marquess of Dorset]], were pardoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=304&nbdash;306}}</ref> Others (most notably [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk|Edmund de la Pole]]) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother [[Richard de la Pole|Richard]] siding against the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was [[stillbirth|stillborn]] on 31 January 1510. About four months later, Catherine again became pregnant.<ref name=\"loades26\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=26}}</ref> On New Year's Day 1511, the child \u2013 [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall|Henry]] \u2013 was born. After the grief of losing their first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held,<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=18}}</ref> including a two-day [[jousting|joust]] known as the [[The 1511 Westminster Tournament Roll|Westminster Tournament]]. However, the child died seven weeks later.<ref name=\"loades26\" /> Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1513 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.<ref name=\"loades4849\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as \"unusually good\",<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=103}}</ref> it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], either Elizabeth or [[Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2009|p=27}}</ref> The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was [[Elizabeth Blount]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, considered by some to be few for a virile young king.<ref name=\"Fraser1994\">{{harvnb|Fraser|1994|p=220}}</ref><ref name=\"loades4748\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: [[David Loades]] believes Henry had mistresses \"only to a very limited extent\",<ref name=\"loades4748\" /> whilst [[Alison Weir]] believes there were numerous other affairs.<ref name=\"Weir\">{{harvnb|Weir|1991|pp=122\u20133}}</ref> There is no evidence that Catherine protested, and in 1518 she fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Henry FitzRoy]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=98,&nbsp;104}}</ref> In 1533, FitzRoy married [[Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Richmond and Somerset|Mary Howard]], but died childless three years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=255}}</ref> At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the [[Second Succession Act]], which could have allowed him to become king.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=255,&nbsp;271}}</ref>\n\n== France and the Habsburgs ==\n[[File:British - Field of the Cloth of Gold - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The meeting of Francis I and Henry VIII at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520]]\n\nIn 1510, [[Kingdom of France|France]], with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the [[League of Cambrai]], was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with [[Louis XII of France]], an issue that divided his council. Certainly war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult.<ref name=\"Loades27\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=27}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand. After [[Pope Julius II]] created the anti-French [[League of Cambrai#Holy League|Holy League]] in October 1511,<ref name=\"Loades27\" /> Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League.

Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles.

These options were legitimising Henry FitzRoy, which would take the intervention of the pope and would be open to challenge; marrying off Mary as soon as possible and hoping for a grandson to inherit directly, but Mary was considered unlikely to conceive before Henry's death; or somehow rejecting Catherine and marrying someone else of child-bearing age. Probably seeing the possibility of marrying Anne, the third was ultimately the most attractive possibility to the 34-year-old Henry,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> and it soon became the King's absorbing desire to annul his marriage to the now 40-year-old Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Brigden|2000|p=114}}</ref> It was a decision that would lead Henry to reject papal authority and initiate the [[English Reformation]].\n\n[[File:1491 Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry, c. 1531]]\n\nHenry's precise motivations and intentions over the coming years are not widely agreed on.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> Henry himself, at least in the early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication ''[[Assertio Septem Sacramentorum]]'' (\"Defence of the Seven Sacraments\") earned him the title of ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith) from Pope [[Leo X]].<ref name=\"elton75\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms.<ref name=\"elton75\" /> It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to [[Leviticus]] 20:21,<ref group=\"nb\">Although Henry would have read the verse in its Latin (vulgate) form, the translation used in the 1604 King James Bible is instructive: \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless\".</ref> an [[Affinity (canon law)|impediment]] Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=91\u201392}}</ref> Henry sent his secretary, [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], to appeal directly to the [[Holy See]] by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull.

He had such a reputation for integrity that his endorsement would have engendered huge support for the annulment among Parliament and the people, who loved Catherine. More's silence so angered Henry that he tried to force his hand by having him imprisoned and tried. The perfidy of the king's secretary, Thomas Cromwell, however, and the perjury of a petty bureaucrat, Richard Rich, brought about More's conviction and execution for treason in 1535.

The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a [[false pregnancy]] or [[miscarriage]] in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal.

This was followed by the [[Second Succession Act]] (the Act of Succession 1536), which declared Henry's children by Jane to be next in the line of succession and declared both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate, thus excluding them from the throne. The king was also granted the power to further determine the line of succession in his will, should he have no further issue.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=350\u2013351}}</ref> However, when Charles and Francis made peace in January 1539, Henry became increasingly paranoid, perhaps as a result of receiving a constant list of threats to the kingdom (real or imaginary, minor or serious) supplied by Cromwell in his role as spymaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=72\u201373}}</ref> Enriched by the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry used some of his financial reserves to build a series of coastal defences and set some aside for use in the event of a Franco-German invasion.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=74\u201375}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage to Anne of Cleves ==\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Portrait of [[Anne of Cleves]]'' by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1539]]\nHaving considered the matter, Cromwell, now Earl of Essex, suggested [[Anne of Cleves|Anne]], the 25-year-old sister of the [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of Cleves]], who was seen as an important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the duke fell between [[Lutheranism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=368\u2013369}}</ref> [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=369\u2013370}}</ref> Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, it is more likely that the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=373\u2013374}}</ref> After seeing Holbein's portrait, and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, the 49-year-old king agreed to wed Anne.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=373\u2013375}}</ref> However, it was not long before Henry wished to annul the marriage so he could marry another.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=370}}</ref><ref name=\"elton289\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=289}}</ref> Anne did not argue, and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=373}}</ref> Anne's previous betrothal to the [[Duke of Lorraine]]'s son [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]] provided further grounds for the annulment.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=372\u20133}}</ref> The marriage was subsequently dissolved, and Anne received the title of \"The King's Sister\", two houses and a generous allowance.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\" /> It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old [[Catherine Howard]], the Duke of Norfolk's niece, the politics of which worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was a political opponent.<ref name=\"elton289291\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=289\u2013291}}</ref>\n\nShortly after, the religious reformers (and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Cromwell) [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]], [[William Jerome (martyr)|William Jerome]] and [[Thomas Garret]] were burned as heretics.<ref name=\"scarisbrick373\" /> Cromwell, meanwhile, fell out of favour although it is unclear exactly why, for there is little evidence of differences of domestic or foreign policy.

As a consequence, the king was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick361\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=361}}</ref> In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints. In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown.

Consequently, the [[Lords Spiritual]]\u2014as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known\u2014were for the first time outnumbered by the [[Lords Temporal]].\n\n== Second invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland ==\n{{Main|Rough Wooing}}\n[[File:Enrique VIII de Inglaterra, por Hans Holbein el Joven.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Henry in 1540, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war. With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian War]] in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=75}}</ref> In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. The Scots were defeated at [[Battle of Solway Moss]] on 24 November 1542,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> and James died on 15 December. Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to James' successor, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]]. The Scottish Regent [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Lord Arran]] agreed to the marriage in the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the [[Rough Wooing]]\".

Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]]. The other, under Suffolk, [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)#First siege|laid siege to Boulogne]].

Francis attempted to invade England in the summer of 1545, but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed in the [[Battle of the Solent]]. Out of money, France and England signed the [[Treaty of Ardres|Treaty of Camp]] on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (\u00a3750,000). Henry needed the money; the 1544 campaign had cost \u00a3650,000, and England was once again bankrupt.<ref name=\"Loades79\" />\n\n== Marriage to Catherine Parr ==\nHenry married his last wife, the wealthy widow [[Catherine Parr]], in July 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=456}}</ref> A reformer at heart, she argued with Henry over religion.

He was covered with painful, [[pus]]-filled [[boils]] and possibly suffered from [[gout]]. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident in 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The [[chronic wound]] festered for the remainder of his life and became [[ulcer (dermatology)|ulcer]]ated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's [[mood swing]]s, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-jousting-accident-that-turned-henry-viii-into-a-tyrant-1670421.html |title=The jousting accident that turned Henry VIII into a tyrant |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite news | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/henry-viii-blood-disorder-110311.html | title = King Henry VIII's Madness Explained | last = Sohn | first = Emily |date = 11 March 2011 | publisher=discovery.com | accessdate =25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe theory that Henry suffered from [[syphilis]] has been dismissed by most historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Hays|2010|p=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Gareth|title=Young and Damned and Fair|year=2016}} p. 130</ref> Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to [[scurvy]], which is caused by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-30/news/mn-1456_1_henry-viii |title=Names in the News: Henry VIII Termed Victim of Scurvy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=30 August 1989}}</ref> Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been [[Kell antigen system|Kell positive]] and suffered from [[McLeod syndrome]].<ref name=\"discovery\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Whitley|Kramer|2010|p=passim}}</ref> According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of [[traumatic brain injury]] after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a [[Neuroendocrine System|neuroendocrine]] cause of his obesity.

Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 [[executor]]s to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18. The executors chose [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be [[Lord Protector]] of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret&nbsp;\u2013 the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 were thereby excluded from the succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=332\u2013333}}</ref> This final provision failed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became King of England in 1603.\n\n== Public image ==\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|left|Musical score of \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\", c. 1513, composed by Henry]]\nHenry cultivated the image of a [[Renaissance man]], and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included [[Benedict de Opitiis]], [[Richard Sampson]], [[Ambrose Lupo]], and Venetian organist [[Dionisio Memo]],<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" /> and Henry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments.

He was also known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety.<ref name=\"Crofton2006a\" /> He was involved in the construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]], and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings which he improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], the [[Palace of Whitehall]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nHenry was an intellectual, the first English king with a modern humanist education. He read and wrote English, French, and Latin, and owned a large library. He annotated many books and published one of his own, and he had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared to support the reformation of the church. Richard Sampson's ''Oratio'' (1534), for example, was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Chibi|1997|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref> At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices; the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Betteridge|2005|pp=91\u2013109}}</ref> Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nHenry was a large, well-built athlete, over {{convert|6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} tall, strong, and broad in proportion, and he excelled at jousting and hunting. These were more than pastimes; they were political devices which served multiple goals, enhancing his athletic royal image, impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, and conveying his ability to suppress any rebellion. He arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517 where he wore gilded armour and gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin, and cloth of gold with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that \"the wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchinson|2012|p=202}}</ref> Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome, and his courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate and flatter him.

The reverse depicts the quartered arms of England and France.]]\n\nHenry inherited a vast fortune and a prosperous economy from his father Henry VII, who had been frugal and careful with money. This fortune was estimated to be \u00a31,250,000 (\u00a3375&nbsp;million by today's standards).<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=13}}</ref> By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms. Although he further augmented his royal treasury through the seizure of church lands, Henry's heavy spending and long periods of mismanagement damaged the economy.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=215\u2013216,&nbsp;355\u20136}}</ref>\n\nMuch of this wealth was spent by Henry on maintaining his court and household, including many of the building works he undertook on royal palaces. Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|hung just 200]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2005|pp=79\u201380}} citing {{harvnb|Thurley|1993|pp=222\u2013224}}</ref> Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 [[Handgun#Single-shot pistols|handguns]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2005|pp=11\u201329}}</ref> Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like [[tonnage and poundage]], granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around \u00a3100,000),<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=64}}</ref> but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.\n\nWhereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth \u00a3120,000 (\u00a336&nbsp;million) a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=393}}</ref> The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=312\u2013314}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformation ===\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\n[[File:King Henry VIII of England and Pope Clement VII.jpg|thumb|King Henry VIII sitting with his feet upon Pope Clement VI, 1641]]\n\nHenry is generally credited with initiating the English Reformation \u2013 the process of transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one \u2013 though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |accessdate=14 April 2013 |year=1997 |title=Competing Narratives: Recent Historiography of the English Reformation under Henry VIII |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615214144/http://gregscouch.homestead.com/files/Henry8.html |archivedate=15 June 2013  }}</ref> and the precise narrative not widely agreed.<ref name=\"elton103\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=103\u2013107}}</ref> Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"elton103\" /> No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy.<ref name=\"elton110\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=110\u2013112}}</ref> The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of [[papal supremacy]] (which he had previously defended), though as historian [[A. F. Pollard]] has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|1905|pp=230\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent [[Church of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=missing}}</ref> These included the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] (passed 1533), which extended the charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty.<ref name=\"bernard71\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=71}}</ref> Other acts included the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and the [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The [[Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534]] required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the King as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath;<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=185}}</ref> those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty.<ref name=\"bernard2005\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Finally, the [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your [[His Grace|Grace]]\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmberg|1970|p=missing}}</ref> The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=195}}</ref>\n\nHenry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the [[Act of Six Articles]], whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.<ref name=\"elton289\" /> It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed [[liturgy]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which would take until 1549 to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=291}}</ref> The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=297}}</ref> Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new [[political theology]] of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected [[Martin Luther]]'s new interpretation of the [[Ten commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|fourth commandment]] (\"Honour thy father and mother\"), brought to England by [[William Tyndale]]. The founding of royal authority on the [[Ten Commandments]] was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the ''[[Great Bible]]'' in 1539 in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Rex|1996|pp=863\u2013894}}</ref> Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale,<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=3177}}</ref> who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.\n\nWhen taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=233}}</ref> In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=233\u2013234}}</ref> In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced [[dissolution of the monasteries]] with all religious houses worth less than \u00a3200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some \u00a390,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=235\u2013236}}</ref> The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=236\u2013237}}</ref> Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently.<ref>{{harvnb|St\u00f6ber|2007|p=190}}</ref> Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=238}}</ref>\n\nResponse to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=254\u2013256}}</ref> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536\u20131537, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=269\u2013272}}</ref> Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553\u20131558).\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Field Armor of King Henry VIII of England (reigned 1509\u201347) MET DT205963.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry's Italian-made suit of armour, c. 1544.

They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the [[war wagon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|2001|p=82}}</ref> relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.<ref name=\"Elton1977b\" />\n\nHenry's break with Rome incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion.<ref name=\"elton282\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=282}}</ref> To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from [[Kent]] to [[Cornwall]], largely built of material gained from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|demolition of the monasteries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=183, 281\u2013283}}</ref> These were known as Henry VIII's [[Device Forts]].

When [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond]] died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Surrey's ambitious aims were costly, but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Surrey was recalled in 1521, with [[Piers Butler]] \u2013 one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond \u2013 appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the [[James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond|Earl of Desmond]], an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=185\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529, which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and the king's son, as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland, his appointment a break with past policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes, but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"loades187\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=187}}</ref> Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell, who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare, on the other hand, was summoned to London; after some hesitation, he departed for London in 1534, where he would face charges of treason.<ref name=\"loades187\" /> His son, [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Thomas, Lord Offaly]] was more forthright, denouncing the king and leading a \"Catholic crusade\" against the king, who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered, and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes, although he failed to secure the support of [[Lord Darcy]], a sympathiser, or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2,000 English troops \u2013 a large army by Irish standards \u2013 and the execution of Offaly (his father was already dead) and his uncles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=187\u2013189}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir [[Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)|Antony St Leger]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who would remain into the post past Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=191}}</ref> Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] free from the Papal [[Lord|overlordship]]. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref> The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe complexities and sheer scale of Henry's legacy ensured that, in the words of Betteridge and Freeman, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" />  Historian J.D.

Pollard]], who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king,  lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953.\n\nElton's book on ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'', maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd, but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=23,332}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of [[Jack Scarisbrick|J. J. Scarisbrick]], his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1968|p=17}}</ref> The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Even among more recent biographers, including [[David Loades]], [[David Starkey]] and [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.<ref name=\"bandf1\" />\n\nThis lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change.<ref name=\"morris19\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]], for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|p=passim}}</ref>\n\n== Style and arms ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Coat of Arms of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547).svg\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Coat of Arms of England (1509-1554).svg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Henry's armorial during his early reign (left) and later reign (right)\n}}\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Lord of Ireland]]\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his ''Defence of the Seven Sacraments'', the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[35 Hen 8]] c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Beaufort portcullis]]. As king, Henry's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by his predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lys]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)''.\n\nIn 1535, Henry added the \"supremacy phrase\" to the royal style, which became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head\". In 1536, the phrase \"of the Church of England\" changed to \"of the Church of England and also of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]]\". In 1541, Henry had the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] change the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" with the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King [[Henry II of England]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrats. The style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| ref=<ref>{{cite book |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy |publisher=Vintage Books |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-09-953973-5 |chapter=The Tudors}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| 1 = 1.

A letter from George Taylor to Lady Lisle dated the 27th April 1534 says that \u201cThe Queen hath a goodly belly, praying our Lord to send us a prince\u201d. In July, Anne\u2019s brother, Lord Rochford, was sent on a diplomatic mission to France to ask for the postponement of a meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I because of Anne\u2019s condition: \u201cbeing so far gone with child she could not cross the sea with the King\u201d. Chapuys backs this up in a letter dated the 27th July, where he refers to Anne\u2019s pregnancy. We do not know what happened with this pregnancy as there is no evidence of the outcome. Dewhurst writes of how the pregnancy could have resulted in a miscarriage or stillbirth, but there is no evidence to support this, he therefore wonders if it was a case of pseudocyesis, a false pregnancy, caused by the stress that Anne was under \u2013 the pressure to provide a son. Chapuys wrote on the 27th September 1534 \u201cSince the King began to doubt whether his lady was enceinte or not, he has renewed and increased the love he formerly had for a beautiful damsel of the court\u201d.

However, Dewhurst thinks that there is an error in the dating of this letter as the editor of the Lisle Letters states that this letter is actually from 1533 or 1534 because it also refers to Sir Christopher Garneys, a man who died in October 1534.</ref>\n|-\n|Unnamed son||colspan=2 style=\"text-align: center;\" |29 January 1536||miscarriage of a child, believed male, in the fourth month of pregnancy<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2003|p=553}}</ref><ref>Chapuys reported to Charles V on the 10th February 1536 that Anne Boleyn had miscarried on the day of Catherine of Aragon\u2019s funeral: \u201cOn the day of the interment [of Catherine of Aragon] the concubine [Anne] had an abortion which seemed to be a male child which she had not borne 3 1/2 months\u201d.</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Jane Seymour]]''''' (married [[Palace of Whitehall]] 30 May 1536) died 24 October 1537\n|-\n|[[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]]||12 October 1537||6 July 1553|| unmarried; no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |'''''By [[Anne of Cleves]]'''''  (married [[Palace of Placentia]] 6 January 1540; annulled 9 July 1540)\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Catherine Howard]]''''' (married [[Oatlands Palace]] 28 July 1540; annulled 23 November 1541) beheaded on 13 February 1542\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"|'''''By [[Catherine Parr]]''''' (married [[Hampton Court Palace]] 12 July 1543; Henry VIII died 28 January 1547)\n|-\n|colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |no issue\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biography|Monarchy|England|Christianity}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Grene growith the holy.ogg|title=''Grene growith the holy'' (0:31)|description=A [[Christmas carol]] attributed to Henry VIII}}\n* [[Cestui que]]\n* [[Cultural depictions of Henry VIII of England]]\n* [[Family tree of English monarchs]]\n* [[History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#Tudor foreign policy|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Inventory of Henry VIII of England]]\n* [[List of English monarchs]]\n* [[Tudor period]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Thomas |year= 2001 |title=The Renaissance at War |publisher=Cassell & Co. |location= London |isbn= 0-304-35270-5 |url= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ashley |first=Mike |year=2002 |title=British Kings & Queens |publisher=Running Press |location= |isbn=0-7867-1104-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofbr0000ashl_f1a2 |ref=harv |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=Hutan |title=Henry VIII's Obesity Following Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Endocrine |volume=42 |year=2011 |pages=218\u20139 |doi=10.1007/s12020-011-9581-z |url=http://www.bioportfolio.com/resources/pmarticle/267683/Henry-Viii-s-Obesity-Following-Traumatic-Brain-Injury.html |ref=harv |pmid=22169966 |issue=1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120102054402/http://www.bioportfolio.com/resources/pmarticle/267683/Henry-Viii-s-Obesity-Following-Traumatic-Brain-Injury.html |archivedate=2 January 2012  }}\n* {{cite book |last=Bernard |first=G.

Seligman was a member of [[The Soft Boys]] and the [[Thompson Twins]], and was a sideman for [[Thomas Dolby]]. In addition, Seligman was also a member of [[Bruce Woolley]] & The Camera Club and [[The Dolphin Brothers]], and backed [[David Bowie]] at his performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.\n\n==Biography==\nSeligman was born in Cyprus, and his family moved to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], [[England]] eight months after his birth. Influenced by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Free (band)|Free]]\u2019s [[Andy Fraser]], and [[Tina Weymouth]] of [[Talking Heads]], he learned bass and subsequently, in his work with [[Thomas Dolby]], Moog. After a short spell with [[Bruce Woolley|Bruce Woolley and The Camera Club]], recording English Garden for CBS Records in 1979, he joined the [[Soft Boys]] for their 1980 album ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'' (1980) with whom he subsequently recorded ''Invisible Hits'' (1981), ''Nextdoorland'' (2002) and ''Side 3'' (2002).\n\nIn addition to [[The Soft Boys]], Seligman was also in the early 80's a member of Local Heroes SW9 (playing on their first album, ''Drip Dry Zone'' (1980), with [[Kevin Armstrong (guitarist)|Kevin Armstrong]]), [[Bruce Woolley|The Camera Club]], the [[Thompson Twins]] and [[The Fallout Club]]. He also played bass with [[Robyn Hitchcock]],<ref name=\"StrongPeel2004\">{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Martin Charles|last2=Peel|first2=John|title=The great rock discography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WoRAPJQ58sC&pg=PA693|accessdate=12 August 2011|date=2004-10-25|publisher=Canongate U.S.|isbn=978-1-84195-615-2|pages=693\u2013}}</ref> and [[Thomas Dolby]], with whom he recorded  the US Billboard No.5 hit \"She Blinded me with Science\" (b/w \"One of our submarines\") in 1983, and the gold and platinum follow-up album, ''[[The Flat Earth]]''.\n\nOthers with whom Matthew has recorded include Knox, the post-[[Japan (band)|Japan]] outfit [[The Dolphin Brothers]], [[Stereo MC's]], [[The Waterboys]], [[David Bowie]] ([[Live Aid]] (concert and DVD), \"[[Absolute Beginners (song)|Absolute Beginners]]\"), [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Transvision Vamp]] (\"[[Tell That Girl To Shut Up]]\", \"Baby I Don't Care\"), [[Morrissey]] (\"[[Ouija Board, Ouija Board]]\", \"Yes I Am Blind\"), [[Nan Vernon]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Kimberley Rew]] and [[Alex Chilton]]. Production credits include a single with Brighton [[jangle pop]] outfit [[The Popguns]] (\"Crazy\", 1991) and ''[[Gravy Deco]]'' for [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\nIn 2002, Seligman played at the Shanghai Festival with Snail, along with Chris Bell and [[Jon Klein (musician)|Jonathan Klein]], and in 2007 began working with the Fire Escapes. In 2011\u201312 he contributed to Thomas Dolby's ''[[A Map of the Floating City]]'' also appearing with him on tours of the UK and northern Europe, at the Blue Note in Tokyo in February 2012 and at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, the UK in July 2012. In 2014, with fellow Fire Escapers Mark Headley and Lucy Pullin, he completed the Magical Creatures' ''Wishing Machine'' collection, also appearing live with them at a summer 2016 William Burroughs-inspired launch party in Brighton, UK.\n\nMatthew has always played a black Fender Jazz bass as his first choice instrument.

The iron-lattice structure was first commissioned and made in Hungary and was planned to bridge the Neretva river in Jablanica. By mistake, it was made shorter by 4 meters, so it was moved to Mostar and installed as the Bridge of Emperor and King [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. A new bridge for Jablanica was commissioned in England and later erected. The bridge that was built in 1888, with a linear grid and an inverted arch on the underside of the bridge. The arch range was 78 m and the ''arch arrow'' was 10 m. It was supported by stone-built walls on both banks, and the depth of the bridge iron-lattice structure at the points of support was 3 meters.\n\nBetween 1-4 March 1943, the Partisans demolished all the bridges on the Neretva and [[Rama (Neretva)|Rama]], from Karaula to Ostro\u017eac. Between 7-8 March, in just 18 hours, a wooden provisional bridge, 56 m long and 2.5 m wide, was built.\n\nIn August 1943, the Germans built a new bridge, which was a spatial grid of rectangular cross-section. The span of the bridge was 78 m and the height of the grid 8 m. The width of the bridge was 5 m. The bridge relied on existing stone-built supports. The grid height at the support points was smaller and was 5 m on either side of the bridge. This bridge was again demolished in 1968 during the filming of the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated film \"[[Battle of Neretva (film)|Battle on the Neretva]]\" by director [[Veljko Bulaji\u0107]].\n\nAs part of the project for the Museum of the Battle for the Wounded on the Neretva River in Jablanica, a reconstruction project for the Memorial Bridge was completed in May 1977. The existing latticework of the demolished railway bridge, which after its demolition in 1968 fell to the left bank of the Neretva, has remained to this day with the necessary works on protection against further collapse and deterioration.\n\nThe bridging of the Neretva river between the pedestrian paths on the right bank toward the existing part laying on the left bank is done by a construction of the missing part of the bridge. This new part is placed from the right bank almost horizontally, with a slight slant towards the part of the bridge on the left bank, and is attached to the new concrete foundations in the Neretva riverbed and on the slope of the right bank. Along the new part of the bridge, wooden transverse beams are laid upstream, over which there is a wooden bridge floor. This wooden part of the memorial was used by visitors to cross from right to left bank, echoing and honoring crossing during the battle.\n\nHowever, in 1991, the swollen Neretva river ripped off entire new section of the bridge, both steel and wooden elements.
