Harding]], the 29th [[President of the United States]]. In 1927, she revealed that her daughter, [[Elizabeth Ann Blaesing|Elizabeth]], had been fathered by Harding while he was serving in the [[United States Senate]], one year before he was elected to the presidency. Her claim was open to question during her life, but was confirmed by DNA testing in 2015.<ref name=Baker12Aug>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/us/dna-is-said-to-solve-a-mystery-of-warren-hardings-love-life.html|title=DNA Is Said to Solve a Mystery of Warren Harding\u2019s Love Life|first=Peter|last=Baker|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=August 13, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Marion, Ohio]], Britton developed an obsession with Harding, who was a friend of her father. As a young girl, her bedroom walls were covered with Harding's pictures from local papers and magazines. While not even 16 years old, she would loiter near his ''[[Marion Daily Star]]'' building in Marion, hoping to see him on his walk home from work.\n\n==Relationship with Harding==\nNan's father, Dr. Samuel H. Britton, spoke to Harding about his daughter's [[Limerence|infatuation]], and Harding met with her, claiming he told her that some day she would find the man of her dreams. At the time, Harding was already involved in a passionate affair with [[Carrie Fulton Phillips]], wife of James Phillips, co-owner of a local [[department store]]. After she graduated from high school in 1914, Britton moved to [[New York City]], to begin a career as a secretary. However, she claimed she also began an intimate relationship with Harding.\n\nFollowing Harding's death, Britton wrote what is considered to be the first kiss-and-tell book. In ''[[The President's Daughter (Britton book)|The President's Daughter]]'', published in 1927, she claimed she had been Harding's mistress all during his presidency, naming him as the father of her daughter, [[Elizabeth Ann Blaesing|Elizabeth Ann]] (1919\u20132005). One famous passage told of their having sex in a coat closet in the executive office of the White House.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scher |first1=Bill |title=I Read Every Memoir by a Presidential Mistress.

Britton insisted she wrote the book to earn money to support her daughter and to champion the rights of illegitimate children. She brought a lawsuit (''Britton v. Klunk''), but she was unable to provide any concrete evidence and was shaken by the vicious personal attacks made by Congressman [[Grant E. Mouser|Grant Mouser]] during the [[cross examination]], which cost her the case.<ref>Carl Sferrazza Anthony, author of ''Florence Harding'', wrote that court transcripts in [[Toledo, Ohio]] show that Mouser referred to Britton as a \"degenerate and pervert\", then \"brought (Florence Kling Harding) in by using Warren's 'love of his good wife' against a 'distorted ... deranged ... demented ... diabolical' Nan who had no respect for the marriage tie ...\"</ref>\n\nBritton's memoirs seem sincere, and her portrayal of Harding and his colloquialisms paints a picture of a crude womanizer. In his 1931 book ''Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the 1920s'', [[Frederick Lewis Allen]] wrote that on the testimony of Britton's book, Harding's private life was \"one of cheap sex episodes\" and that \"one sees with deadly clarity the essential ordinariness of the man, the commonness of his 'Gee dearie' and 'Say, you darling'.\" Britton's book was among those irreverently reviewed by [[Dorothy Parker]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine as part of her famous ''Constant Reader'' column, under the title \"An American [[Madame du Barry|DuBarry]].\"\n\nIn 1964, the \"discovery of more than 250 love letters that Mr. Harding had written to Mrs. James Phillips of Marion Ohio, between 1909 and 1920 gave further support to Britton's own claims.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/15/nan-britton-lives-in-seclusion-in-chicago-suburb.html |title=Nan Britton lives in seclusion in Chicago suburb |date=July 15, 1964 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-access=subscription }}</ref>  Journalist [[R.W.
