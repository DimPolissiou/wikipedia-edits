These include the values of [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants]], the relative strength of [[nuclear force]]s, [[electromagnetism]], and [[Gravitation|gravity]] between [[Elementary particle|fundamental particles]], as well as the ratios of masses of such particles. Intelligent design proponent and Center for Science and Culture fellow [[Guillermo Gonzalez (astronomer)|Guillermo Gonzalez]] argues that if any of these values were even slightly different, the universe would be dramatically different, making it impossible for many [[chemical element]]s and features of the [[Universe]], such as [[galaxy|galaxies]], to form.<ref>[[#Gonzalez 2004|Gonzalez 2004]]</ref> Thus, proponents argue, an intelligent designer of life was needed to ensure that the requisite features were present to achieve that particular outcome.\n\nScientists have generally responded that these arguments are poorly supported by existing evidence.<ref>[[#Stenger 2011|Stenger 2011]], p. 243</ref><ref>[[#Susskind 2005|Susskind 2005]]</ref> [[Victor J.

A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.<ref>[[#Huchingson 1993|Feinberg & Shapiro 1993]], \"A Puddlian Fable\", pp. 220\u2013221</ref>\n\n===Intelligent designer===\n{{Main|Intelligent designer}}\n\nThe contemporary intelligent design movement formulates its arguments in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoids identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'' (1998), speculates that an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture could fulfill these requirements. ''Of Pandas and People'' proposes that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock]] suggested the [[Ra\u00eblian beliefs and practices|Ra\u00eblian]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that \"make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists\".<ref>[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 229\u2013229, 233\u2013242</ref> The authoritative description of intelligent design,<ref name=\"DI-topquestions\" /> however, explicitly states that the ''Universe'' displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the [[paradox]], Dembski concludes that \"no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/119 |title=The Act of Creation: Bridging Transcendence and Immanence |last=Dembski |first=William A. |date=August 10, 1998 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-02-28}} \"Presented at Millstatt Forum, Strasbourg, France, 10 August 1998.\"</ref> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all other religions.<ref name=\"dembski_logos\" />\n\nBeyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would \"give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes\" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why a designer would not \"stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species\". Coyne also points to the fact that \"the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different\" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\">{{cite magazine |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=August 22, 2005 |title=The Case Against Intelligent Design: The Faith That Dare Not Speak Its Name |url=http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-case-against-intelligent-design |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Previously, in ''Darwin's Black Box'', Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, \"...have been placed there by the designer for a reason\u2014for artistic reasons, for variety, to show off, for some as-yet-undetected practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason\u2014or they might not.\"<ref name=\"odd_design\">[[#Behe 1996|Behe 1996]], p. 221</ref> Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, \"either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved.\"<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\" />\n\nIntelligent design proponents such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] avoid the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that \"Another problem with the argument from imperfection is that it critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are.\"<ref name=\"odd_design\" /> This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Retired [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] law professor, author and intelligent design advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]] puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] was created to punish immorality and [[HIV/AIDS denialism|is not caused by HIV]], but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.<ref name=\"Pennock 245\">[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 245\u2013249, 265, 296\u2013300</ref>\n\nAsserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question \"What designed the designer?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/philosop/empty.htm |title=Intelligent Design: The Glass is Empty |last=Simanek |first=Donald E. |date=February 2006 |website=Donald Simanek's Pages |publisher=[[Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania]] |location=Lock Haven, PA |accessdate=2012-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714082248/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/philosop/empty.htm |archivedate=2012-07-14 }}</ref> Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.<ref group=\"n\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1147 |title=FAQ: Who designed the designer? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center]] |publisher=Casey Luskin; IDEA Center |location=Seattle |type=Short answer |accessdate=2014-02-28 |quote=One need not fully understand the origin or identity of the designer to determine that an object was designed.

Michael Behe's highly successful ''Darwin's Black Box'' followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID).

Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction.

Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that \"we don't know yet\" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, Michael Behe's demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design.

Arkansas]]'' (1982) trial, which found it was \"contrived dualism\", the false premise of a \"two model approach\".

Sometimes examples are quoted that are said to require an 'intelligent designer'.

Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'' (1998), speculates that an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture could fulfill these requirements. ''Of Pandas and People'' proposes that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock]] suggested the [[Ra\u00eblian beliefs and practices|Ra\u00eblian]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that \"make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists\".<ref>[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 229\u2013229, 233\u2013242</ref> The authoritative description of intelligent design,<ref name=\"DI-topquestions\" /> however, explicitly states that the ''Universe'' displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the [[paradox]], Dembski concludes that \"no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/119 |title=The Act of Creation: Bridging Transcendence and Immanence |last=Dembski |first=William A. |date=August 10, 1998 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-02-28}} \"Presented at Millstatt Forum, Strasbourg, France, 10 August 1998.\"</ref> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all other religions.<ref name=\"dembski_logos\" />\n\nBeyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would \"give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes\" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why a designer would not \"stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species\". Coyne also points to the fact that \"the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different\" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\">{{cite magazine |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=August 22, 2005 |title=The Case Against Intelligent Design: The Faith That Dare Not Speak Its Name |url=http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-case-against-intelligent-design |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Previously, in ''Darwin's Black Box'', Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, \"...have been placed there by the designer for a reason\u2014for artistic reasons, for variety, to show off, for some as-yet-undetected practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason\u2014or they might not.\"<ref name=\"odd_design\">[[#Behe 1996|Behe 1996]], p. 221</ref> Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, \"either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved.\"<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\" />\n\nIntelligent design proponents such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] avoid the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that \"Another problem with the argument from imperfection is that it critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer.

Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered.

Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are [[Argument from ignorance|arguments from ignorance]].\nIn the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that \"we don't know yet\" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, Michael Behe's demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.<ref name=\"Scott and Branch\">{{cite web\n|url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |title='Intelligent Design' Not Accepted by Most Scientists |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=August 12, 2002\n|origyear=Reprinted with permission from ''School Board News'', August 13, 2002 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |type=Blog |accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref>\n\nIn his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge John E.

Arkansas]]'' (1982) trial, which found it was \"contrived dualism\", the false premise of a \"two model approach\". Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design.

Their aim has been to expose more students to articles and videos produced by advocates of intelligent design that criticise evolution. They have been presented as supporting \"[[academic freedom]]\", on the supposition that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection. Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution, and an investigation in [[Florida]] of allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred. The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana's [[Louisiana Science Education Act]], which was enacted in 2008.\n\nIn April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K\u201012 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as \"Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.\" However, these worldviews as well as others \"that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses.

When [[Mongols]] entered the Ottoman realm, Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 participated in the [[Battle of Angora]] in 1402 when Ottomans were defeated and sultan Bayezid was captured. Returning to Serbia, Stefan visited [[Constantinople]] where the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] granted him the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. In previous years, title would mean that the despot would rule some vassal state, but as the Byzantine Empire was too weak to assert such a rule and Serbia was not its vassal state, Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 took this title as the personal style of the Serbian monarchs, thus the Principality of Serbia became the Serbian Despotate.\n|--\n!colspan=5 | See \"Serbian Despotate\".\n|-\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Picture\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | <sup>Title</sup>Name\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Reign\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Overlordship\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Notes\n|--\n!style=background:lightblue; colspan=5 | [[Lordship of Prilep]] ([[House of Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107|Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]])\n|--\n|[[File:King Vuka\u0161in, Psa\u010da.jpg|80px]]||<sup>King<br>\u2191Lord</sup><br>[[Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]] || 1365&ndash;1371 || None || Killed in the [[Battle of Maritsa]].\n|--\n|[[File:Marko Mrnjavcevic.JPG|80px]]||<sup>King</sup><br>[[Prince Marko|Marko Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]]<br><small>''Prince Marko''</small> || 1371\u20131395 || Ottoman || Son of Vuka\u0161in.

He acquired dynastic legitimacy by marrying [[Milica Nemanji\u0107]], and despite retaining only the minor title of [[Knez (title)|knez]] (\"prince\"), he nevertheless used the imperial name of 'Stefan' as well as the designation \"[[autocrator]]\".  Lazar spent his time strengthening the Serbian state, knowing fully well that he would eventually have to face the Ottoman threat. He unified most of Serbia under his rule and managed to gain the loyalty of a majority of the Serbs. He also ceded the title \"King of Serbs\" to King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]] (great-grandson of [[Uro\u0161 the Great]]). His first major military action was at the [[Battle of Dubravnica]] where his two subjects, Crep and Vladimir managed to decisively defeat an Ottoman army in southern Serbia. No further recorded hostilities took place until the [[Battle of Plo\u010dnik]] where Knez Lazar managed to crush an Ottoman force and drive them back to [[Ni\u0161]]. Serbian troops also took part in the [[Battle of Bile\u0107a]] where again he defeated the Turks. Lazar was killed during the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo]] along with most of Serbia's political elite.\n|--\n|[[File:Stefan Lazarevic-freska.JPG|80px]]||<sup>Despote<br>\u2191Prince</sup><br>[[Stefan Lazarevi\u0107]]<br><small>''Stefan the Tall''</small>|| 1389&ndash;1427 || Ottoman 1391&ndash;1404----Hungarian 1404&ndash;1427 || Son of Lazar. In 1391, Serbia became an Ottoman vassal, so Stefan was obliged to aid the Ottoman sultan in battles when asked. He did so in the [[Battle of Rovine]] in May 1395 against the [[Wallachia]]n prince [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] and the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396 against the Hungarian king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. After that, Sultan Bayezid awarded Stefan with the [[Vuk Brankovi\u0107]]'s land on Kosovo, as Brankovi\u0107 sided with the Hungarian king at Nicopolis.  When [[Mongols]] entered the Ottoman realm, Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 participated in the [[Battle of Angora]] in 1402 when Ottomans were defeated and sultan Bayezid was captured. Returning to Serbia, Stefan visited [[Constantinople]] where the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] granted him the title of [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. In previous years, title would mean that the despot would rule some vassal state, but as the Byzantine Empire was too weak to assert such a rule and Serbia was not its vassal state, Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 took this title as the personal style of the Serbian monarchs, thus the Principality of Serbia became the Serbian Despotate.\n|--\n!colspan=5 | See \"Serbian Despotate\".\n|-\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Picture\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | <sup>Title</sup>Name\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Reign\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Overlordship\n!style=background:#FFDEAD; | Notes\n|--\n!style=background:lightblue; colspan=5 | [[Lordship of Prilep]] ([[House of Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107|Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]])\n|--\n|[[File:King Vuka\u0161in, Psa\u010da.jpg|80px]]||<sup>King<br>\u2191Lord</sup><br>[[Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]] || 1365&ndash;1371 || None || Killed in the [[Battle of Maritsa]].\n|--\n|[[File:Marko Mrnjavcevic.JPG|80px]]||<sup>King</sup><br>[[Prince Marko|Marko Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107]]<br><small>''Prince Marko''</small> || 1371\u20131395 || Ottoman || Son of Vuka\u0161in.
