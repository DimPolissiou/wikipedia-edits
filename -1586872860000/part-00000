{"title_page": "Mobile signature", "text_new": "A '''mobile signature''' is a [[digital signature]] generated either on a mobile phone or on a [[SIM card]] on a mob phone.\n\n==Origins of the term==\n\n===mSign===\nThe term first appeared in articles introducing [[mSign]] (short for Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium).  It was founded in 1999 and comprised 35 member companies. In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber.\n\nIn 2001, [[mSign]] gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founding companies) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.\n\n===ETSI-MSS standardization===\nThe term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&D) and Romary Dupuis ([[France Telecom]]) in their standardisation work at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203.\n\nThe ETSI-MSS specifications define a [[SOAP]] interface and mobile signature roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ETSI TS 102 204, and ETSI TS 102 207.\n\n==Today==\nThe mobile signature can have the legal equivalent of your own wet signature, hence the term \"Mobile Ink\", commercial term coined by Swiss [http://www.sicap.com/ Sicap]. Other terms include \"Mobile ID\" by [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless], \"Mobile Certificate\" by a circle of trust of 3 Finnish mobile network operators implementing a roaming mobile signature framework Mobiilivarmenne, etc.\n\nAccording to the EU directives for [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT electronic signatures]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 31999L0093 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> the mobile signature can have the same level of protection as the handwritten signature if all components in the signature creation chain are appropriately certified. The governing standard for the mobile signature creation devices and equivalent of a handwritten signature is described in the Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with the [[Electronic Signatures Directive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003D0511:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003D0511 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> If the signature solution is [[Common Criteria]] evaluated by an independent party and given the EAL4+ designation, the solution can produce what the EU directive and consequent clarifications are calling a [[qualified electronic signature]].

Usually, this is in form of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. If the access control secret was entered correctly, the device is approved with access to secret data containing for example [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[private key]], which is then used to do the signature or other operations that the request wanted.\n\nThe [[public key infrastructure|PKI]] system associates the public key counterpart of the secret key held at the secure device with a set of attributes contained in a structure called [[digital certificate]]. The choice of the registration procedure details during the definition of the attributes included in this digital certificate can be used to produce different levels of identity assurance. Anything from anonymous but specific to high-standard real-word identity. By doing a signature, the secure device owner can claim that identity.\n\nThus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for:\n* Proving your real-world identity to third parties without face-to-face communications\n* Making a legally-binding commitment by sending a confirmed message to another party\n* Solve security problems of the online world with identity confirmation (an anonymous but specific identity is often equally good as a high-standards identity)\n\n=== Public services ===\n\n==== Estonian Mobile-ID ====\nSee [http://e-estonia.com/components/mobile-id].\n\n==== Mobile Ink (Finland) ====\n[http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink Mobile Ink]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink|title=Mobile Ink|publisher=}}</ref> unites high security and user-friendly access to digital services which require strong authentication and authorization.

Another national feature is that mobile phone numbers are portable across the operators, and thus the phone number prefix does not identify the operator. To make things easy for the Application Providers (see ETSI TS 102 204), they can purchase service from any one of the Acquiring Entity service providers (mobile network operators), and reach all users.\n\nPart of the background was update of national laws allowing digital Person Identity Certificates (for Mobiilivarmenne use) to be issued also by other parties than official registration authorities via Police offices. Another part was co-operation agreement between the operators on the form of the certificates, and certification procedures and practices producing similar certificate contents with similar identity issuance traceability. All of these were reviewed and approved by the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority which tasks include the oversight of the identity registration services also at government registries.\n\nThe MSSP software vendors in the service mesh are [http://www.methics.fi/ Methics Oy], and [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless].

However, supporting the authentication on the Internet with a parallel closed network like mobile/GSM and a digital signature enabled SIM card is the most secure method today against the man in the middle attack. If application provider provides a detailed explanation of the transaction to be signed both on its Internet site and signing request to mobile operator, the attack can easily be recognized by the individual by comparing both screens. Since mobile operators do not let applications to send signing request for free, normally the cost and technicality of intrusion between the application provider and the mobile operator makes it an improbable attack target. Very least there are trace evidences in multiple places for the attack to have happened.\n\n==With on-board key generation==\nWhen a mobile user creates the sPIN (signing PIN) and secret key online within the secure [[SIM card]] during the registration process, this is known as \"on-board key generation\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Support of SmartTrust OBKG function at Kiuru MSSP|url=http://www.methics.fi/company/news/news-archive/#20090601|publisher=Methics Oy}}</ref> This requires a bit more interaction on user's behalf while registering, but on the other hand it makes the security mode interaction process familiar and lets them practice service usage. Also when the user forgets/locks the PIN associated with generated key, it is simple to generate a new key and assign it a new sPIN destroying the previous versions using same process as with original registration, and most importantly: without need for replacement of the SIM card. In these systems there is commonly no secondary signing PIN unblocking code (sPUK) at all, because revelation of such a code has identical requirements for the requesting person's identity verification as was with original person's identity registration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key and PIN Life Cycle at Alauda WPKI Applet|url=http://www.methics.fi/products/wpki-products/alauda-wpki-client/#key-and-pin-lifecycle|publisher=Methics Oy}}</ref>\n\nCompare this with older \"factory generated keys\" model for older technology SIM cards that had insufficient processing power to do on-board key generation. The SIM card factory ran key-generation with special hardware accelerator and stored the key material on card along with initial sPIN and sPUK codes. Sometimes actual generation happened within the SIM card that was running in special manufacturing mode. After the generation the capability of doing it at all was usually disabled by blowing a special control fuse. Delivery of in particular the sPUK codes creates considerable security information logistics problems, which can entirely be avoided with the use of  on-board key generation.\n\nTurkcell was the first provider to roll out a mobile signature service with \"On Board Key Generation\" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to distribute signing PINs to customers. Customers can create their sPIN anew, on their own.<ref>{{in lang|tr}} [http://www.turkcell.com.tr/index/0,1028,400004,00.html?banner=dig_20022007_turkcellmobilimza Turkcell.com]</ref>\n\nIn introduction of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobiilivarmenne.fi/en/bulletin/|title=News in English|publisher=Mobiilivarmenne portal}}</ref> service in 2010, only one out of three operators chose to use this on-board key generation capability with user interaction. Cited reasons claimed it to be too hard for the user. Actual experience did show that those without it created easily non-functional registrations without any online indication of the status, while usage of on-board key generation always resulted in positive indication of success when the service became fully functional for the user.

In October 2000, the consortium published an XML-interface defining a protocol allowing service providers to obtain a mobile (digital) signature from a mobile phone subscriber.\n\nIn 2001, [[mSign]] gained industry-wide coverage when it came apparent that Brokat (one of the founding companies) also obtained a process patent in Germany for using the mobile phone to generate digital signatures.\n\n===ETSI-MSS standardization===\nThe term was then used by Paul Gibson (G&D) and Romary Dupuis ([[France Telecom]]) in their standardisation work at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and published in ETSI Technical Report TR 102 203.\n\nThe ETSI-MSS specifications define a [[SOAP]] interface and mobile signature roaming for systems implementing mobile signature services. ETSI TS 102 204, and ETSI TS 102 207.\n\n==Today==\nThe mobile signature can have the legal equivalent of your own wet signature, hence the term \"Mobile Ink\", commercial term coined by Swiss [http://www.sicap.com/ Sicap]. Other terms include \"Mobile ID\" by [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless], \"Mobile Certificate\" by a circle of trust of 3 Finnish mobile network operators implementing a roaming mobile signature framework Mobiilivarmenne, etc.\n\nAccording to the EU directives for [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT electronic signatures]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 31999L0093 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> the mobile signature can have the same level of protection as the handwritten signature if all components in the signature creation chain are appropriately certified. The governing standard for the mobile signature creation devices and equivalent of a handwritten signature is described in the Commission Decision 2003/511/EC of 14 July 2003 on the publication of reference numbers of generally recognised standards for electronic signature products in accordance with the [[Electronic Signatures Directive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003D0511:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32003D0511 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref> If the signature solution is [[Common Criteria]] evaluated by an independent party and given the EAL4+ designation, the solution can produce what the EU directive and consequent clarifications are calling a [[qualified electronic signature]].

Usually, this is in form of a [[Personal identification number|PIN]]. If the access control secret was entered correctly, the device is approved with access to secret data containing for example [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[private key]], which is then used to do the signature or other operations that the request wanted.\n\nThe [[public key infrastructure|PKI]] system associates the public key counterpart of the secret key held at the secure device with a set of attributes contained in a structure called [[digital certificate]]. The choice of the registration procedure details during the definition of the attributes included in this digital certificate can be used to produce different levels of identity assurance. Anything from anonymous but specific to high-standard real-word identity. By doing a signature, the secure device owner can claim that identity.\n\nThus, the mobile signature is a unique feature for:\n* Proving your real-world identity to third parties without face-to-face communications\n* Making a legally-binding commitment by sending a confirmed message to another party\n* Solve security problems of the online world with identity confirmation (an anonymous but specific identity is often equally good as a high-standards identity)\n\n=== Public services ===\n\n==== Estonian Mobile-ID ====\nSee [http://e-estonia.com/components/mobile-id].\n\n==== Mobile Ink (Finland) ====\n[http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink Mobile Ink]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicap.com/solutions/mink/mink|title=Mobile Ink|publisher=}}</ref> unites high security and user-friendly access to digital services which require strong authentication and authorization.

Another national feature is that mobile phone numbers are portable across the operators, and thus the phone number prefix does not identify the operator. To make things easy for the Application Providers (see ETSI TS 102 204), they can purchase service from any one of the Acquiring Entity service providers (mobile network operators), and reach all users.\n\nPart of the background was update of national laws allowing digital Person Identity Certificates (for Mobiilivarmenne use) to be issued also by other parties than official registration authorities via Police offices. Another part was co-operation agreement between the operators on the form of the certificates, and certification procedures and practices producing similar certificate contents with similar identity issuance traceability. All of these were reviewed and approved by the Finnish Communication Regulatory Authority which tasks include the oversight of the identity registration services also at government registries.\n\nThe MSSP software vendors in the service mesh are [http://www.methics.fi/ Methics Oy], and [http://www.valimo.com/ Valimo Wireless].

However, supporting the authentication on the Internet with a parallel closed network like mobile/GSM and a digital signature enabled SIM card is the most secure method today against the man in the middle attack. If application provider provides a detailed explanation of the transaction to be signed both on its Internet site and signing request to mobile operator, the attack can easily be recognized by the individual by comparing both screens. Since mobile operators do not let applications to send signing request for free, normally the cost and technicality of intrusion between the application provider and the mobile operator makes it an improbable attack target. Very least there are trace evidences in multiple places for the attack to have happened.\n\n==With on-board key generation==\nWhen a mobile user creates the sPIN (signing PIN) and secret key online within the secure [[SIM card]] during the registration process, this is known as \"on-board key generation\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Support of SmartTrust OBKG function at Kiuru MSSP|url=http://www.methics.fi/company/news/news-archive/#20090601|publisher=Methics Oy}}</ref> This requires a bit more interaction on user's behalf while registering, but on the other hand it makes the security mode interaction process familiar and lets them practice service usage. Also when the user forgets/locks the PIN associated with generated key, it is simple to generate a new key and assign it a new sPIN destroying the previous versions using same process as with original registration, and most importantly: without need for replacement of the SIM card. In these systems there is commonly no secondary signing PIN unblocking code (sPUK) at all, because revelation of such a code has identical requirements for the requesting person's identity verification as was with original person's identity registration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key and PIN Life Cycle at Alauda WPKI Applet|url=http://www.methics.fi/products/wpki-products/alauda-wpki-client/#key-and-pin-lifecycle|publisher=Methics Oy}}</ref>\n\nCompare this with older \"factory generated keys\" model for older technology SIM cards that had insufficient processing power to do on-board key generation. The SIM card factory ran key-generation with special hardware accelerator and stored the key material on card along with initial sPIN and sPUK codes. Sometimes actual generation happened within the SIM card that was running in special manufacturing mode. After the generation the capability of doing it at all was usually disabled by blowing a special control fuse. Delivery of in particular the sPUK codes creates considerable security information logistics problems, which can entirely be avoided with the use of  on-board key generation.\n\nTurkcell was the first provider to roll out a mobile signature service with \"On Board Key Generation\" functionality, which enables customers to create their signing and validation key pair, after they get the simcard. In this way GSM operators do not need to distribute signing PINs to customers. Customers can create their sPIN anew, on their own.<ref>{{in lang|tr}} [http://www.turkcell.com.tr/index/0,1028,400004,00.html?banner=dig_20022007_turkcellmobilimza Turkcell.com]</ref>\n\nIn introduction of the Finnish Mobiilivarmenne<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobiilivarmenne.fi/en/bulletin/|title=News in English|publisher=Mobiilivarmenne portal}}</ref> service in 2010, only one out of three operators chose to use this on-board key generation capability with user interaction.

Connelly's mother was a fan of [[crime fiction]] and introduced her son to the world of [[mystery novels]].<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nAt age 12, Connelly moved with his family from Philadelphia to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he attended [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]]. At age 16, Connelly's interest in crime and mystery escalated when, on his way home from his work as a hotel dishwasher, he witnessed a man throw an object into a hedge. Connelly decided to investigate and found that the object was a gun wrapped in a [[lumberjack]] shirt. After putting the gun back, he followed the man to a bar and then left to go home to tell his father. Later that night, Connelly brought the police down to the bar, but the man was already gone. This event introduced Connelly to the world of police officers and their lives, impressing him with the way they worked.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nConnelly had planned on following his father's early choice of career in building construction and started out at the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], at the [[Rinker School of Building Construction]], studying construction management. After earning grades that were lower than expected, Connelly went to see [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). The film, based on [[Raymond Chandler]]'s eponymous [[The Long Goodbye (novel)|1953 novel]], inspired Connelly to want to become a mystery writer. Connelly went home and read all of Chandler's works featuring [[Philip Marlowe]], and decided to transfer to the [[University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications]], major in journalism, and minor in creative writing.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nAfter graduating from the University of Florida in 1980, Connelly got a job as a crime beat writer at the ''[[Daytona Beach News Journal]]'', where he worked for almost two years until he went to the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel]]'' in 1981. There, he covered the crime beat during the South Florida cocaine wars.<ref name=\"michael\"/> He stayed with the paper for a few years and in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 [[Delta Flight 191]] plane crash, which story earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=\"january\"/>  The honor also brought Connelly a job as a crime reporter at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He moved to California in 1987 with his wife Linda McCaleb, whom he met while in college and married in April 1984.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Connelly went to see the High Tower Apartments where Raymond Chandler's character Philip Marlowe had lived (in ''[[The High Window]]'' (1942)), and [[Robert Altman]] had used for his film ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). Connelly got the manager of the building to promise to phone him if the apartment ever became available. Ten years later, the manager tracked Connelly down, and Connelly decided to rent the place. This apartment served as a place to write for several years.<ref name=\"life\"/><ref name=\"hightower\">{{cite news|url=http://bookpage.com/interviews/8140-michael-connelly#.Vtu4XPA8KrU |work=Bookpage.com |title=Final Deadline: Interview for ''The Scarecrow''|date=June 2009|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years at the ''Los Angeles Times'', Connelly wrote his first published novel, ''[[The Black Echo]]'' (1992), after previously writing two unfinished novels that he had not attempted to get published.<ref name=\"life\"/> He sold ''The Black Echo'' to [[Little, Brown]] to be published in 1992 and won the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[Edgar Award]] for best first novel.<ref name=\"january\">{{cite web|url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/connelly.html |title=January magazine profile |publisher=Januarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly's primary recurring character, [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Detective [[Harry Bosch|Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch]],<ref name=\"michael\"/> a man who, according to Connelly, shares few similarities with the author himself.<ref name=\"life\"/> Connelly named Bosch after the Dutch painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]], known for his paintings full of sin and redemption, such as the painting ''[[Hell (Bosch)|Hell]]'', a copy of which hangs on the office wall behind Connelly's computer.<ref name=\"meet\"/><ref name=\"notable\"/> Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometimes they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. This is something that Connelly creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nConnelly went on to write three more novels about Detective Bosch \u2014 ''[[The Black Ice]]'' (1993), ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (1995) \u2014 before quitting his job as a reporter to write full-time.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\n==Full-time novelist==\nHarry Bosch and Connelly received a good deal of publicity in 1994, when President [[Bill Clinton]] came out of a bookstore carrying a copy of ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]'' in front of the waiting cameras. A meeting was set up between the two at the [[Los Angeles Airport]].<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Connelly wrote ''[[The Poet (novel)|The Poet]]'', his first book not to feature Bosch; the protagonist was reporter Jack McEvoy.

''Blood Work'' was made into a film in 2002, directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], who also played McCaleb,<ref name=\"notable\"/> an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor's murderer.

The book was made into a film in 2011, starring [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Haller. After releasing ''Crime Beat'' (2006), a non-fiction book about Connelly's experiences as a crime reporter, Connelly went back to Bosch with ''[[Echo Park (novel)|Echo Park]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"michael\"/> This book sets its opening scene in the High Tower Apartment that Connelly rented and wrote from.<ref name=\"life\"/> His next Bosch story, ''[[The Overlook]]'', was originally published as a multi-part series in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.

Even events that might not be considered as world-changing are included in some of the books, because they are of personal interest to Connelly. For example, in ''City of Bones'', Detective Bosch investigates the murder of an 11-year-old boy. This was written during Connelly's early years as a father of a daughter, and it hit close to home. According to Connelly, he didn't mean to write about the biggest fear of his life; it just came out that way.<ref name=\"author\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/connelly.html |title=Michael Connelly |publisher=Powells.com |accessdate=2012-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715000141/http://www.powells.com/authors/connelly.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nDetective Bosch's life usually changes in harmony with Connelly's own life. When Connelly moved 3,000 miles across the country from [[Florida]], Bosch had some life-changing experiences that sent him in a new direction in the book written at that time, ''City of Bones''. According to Connelly, his \"real\" job is to write about Bosch,<ref name=\"author\"/> and his purpose in bringing McCaleb and Bosch together in ''[[A Darkness More Than Night]]'' was to use McCaleb as a tool to look at Bosch from another perspective and keep the character interesting.<ref name=\"author\"/>\n\n==Recurring characters==\nEvery character in the list below, with one exception, has appeared in a Harry Bosch book.

Connelly's mother was a fan of [[crime fiction]] and introduced her son to the world of [[mystery novels]].<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nAt age 12, Connelly moved with his family from Philadelphia to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he attended [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]]. At age 16, Connelly's interest in crime and mystery escalated when, on his way home from his work as a hotel dishwasher, he witnessed a man throw an object into a hedge. Connelly decided to investigate and found that the object was a gun wrapped in a [[lumberjack]] shirt. After putting the gun back, he followed the man to a bar and then left to go home to tell his father. Later that night, Connelly brought the police down to the bar, but the man was already gone. This event introduced Connelly to the world of police officers and their lives, impressing him with the way they worked.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nConnelly had planned on following his father's early choice of career in building construction and started out at the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], at the [[Rinker School of Building Construction]], studying construction management. After earning grades that were lower than expected, Connelly went to see [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). The film, based on [[Raymond Chandler]]'s eponymous [[The Long Goodbye (novel)|1953 novel]], inspired Connelly to want to become a mystery writer. Connelly went home and read all of Chandler's works featuring [[Philip Marlowe]], and decided to transfer to the [[University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications]], major in journalism, and minor in creative writing.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nAfter graduating from the University of Florida in 1980, Connelly got a job as a crime beat writer at the ''[[Daytona Beach News Journal]]'', where he worked for almost two years until he went to the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel]]'' in 1981. There, he covered the crime beat during the South Florida cocaine wars.<ref name=\"michael\"/> He stayed with the paper for a few years and in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 [[Delta Flight 191]] plane crash, which story earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=\"january\"/>  The honor also brought Connelly a job as a crime reporter at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He moved to California in 1987 with his wife Linda McCaleb, whom he met while in college and married in April 1984.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Connelly went to see the High Tower Apartments where Raymond Chandler's character Philip Marlowe had lived (in ''[[The High Window]]'' (1942)), and [[Robert Altman]] had used for his film ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973). Connelly got the manager of the building to promise to phone him if the apartment ever became available. Ten years later, the manager tracked Connelly down, and Connelly decided to rent the place. This apartment served as a place to write for several years.<ref name=\"life\"/><ref name=\"hightower\">{{cite news|url=http://bookpage.com/interviews/8140-michael-connelly#.Vtu4XPA8KrU |work=Bookpage.com |title=Final Deadline: Interview for ''The Scarecrow''|date=June 2009|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAfter three years at the ''Los Angeles Times'', Connelly wrote his first published novel, ''[[The Black Echo]]'' (1992), after previously writing two unfinished novels that he had not attempted to get published.<ref name=\"life\"/> He sold ''The Black Echo'' to [[Little, Brown]] to be published in 1992 and won the [[Mystery Writers of America]]'s [[Edgar Award]] for best first novel.<ref name=\"january\">{{cite web|url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/connelly.html |title=January magazine profile |publisher=Januarymagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly's primary recurring character, [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Detective [[Harry Bosch|Hieronymus \"Harry\" Bosch]],<ref name=\"michael\"/> a man who, according to Connelly, shares few similarities with the author himself.<ref name=\"life\"/> Connelly named Bosch after the Dutch painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]], known for his paintings full of sin and redemption, such as the painting ''[[Hell (Bosch)|Hell]]'', a copy of which hangs on the office wall behind Connelly's computer.<ref name=\"meet\"/><ref name=\"notable\"/> Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometimes they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. This is something that Connelly creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nConnelly went on to write three more novels about Detective Bosch \u2014 ''[[The Black Ice]]'' (1993), ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Last Coyote]]'' (1995) \u2014 before quitting his job as a reporter to write full-time.<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\n==Full-time novelist==\nHarry Bosch and Connelly received a good deal of publicity in 1994, when President [[Bill Clinton]] came out of a bookstore carrying a copy of ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]'' in front of the waiting cameras. A meeting was set up between the two at the [[Los Angeles Airport]].<ref name=\"notable\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Connelly wrote ''[[The Poet (novel)|The Poet]]'', his first book not to feature Bosch; the protagonist was reporter Jack McEvoy. The book was a success.<ref name=\"notable\"/> In 1997, Connelly returned to Bosch in ''[[Trunk Music (novel)|Trunk Music]]'' before writing another book, ''[[Blood Work (novel)|Blood Work]]'' (1998), about a different character, [[FBI]] agent [[Terry McCaleb]]. ''Blood Work'' was made into a film in 2002, directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], who also played McCaleb,<ref name=\"notable\"/> an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor's murderer. The book came together after one of Connelly's friends had a heart transplant, and he saw what his friend was going through with survivor's guilt after the surgery.<ref name=\"michael\"/> When asked if he had anything against the changes made to fit the big screen, Connelly simply replied: \"If you take their money, it's their turn to tell the story\".<ref name=\"cops\">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117956757.html?nav=goldstandard |title=Michael Connelly; The Gold Standard: How the movies - past and present - changed our lives|work=[[Variety magazine|Variety]]|date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\nConnelly wrote another book featuring Bosch, ''[[Angels Flight (novel)|Angels Flight]]'' (1999), before writing ''[[Void Moon]]'' (2000), a free-standing book about [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] thief Cassie Black. In 2001, ''[[A Darkness More Than Night]]'' was published, in which Connelly united Bosch and McCaleb to solve a crime together, before releasing two books in 2002. The first, ''[[City of Bones (Connelly novel)|City of Bones]]'', was the eighth Bosch novel, and the other, ''[[Chasing the Dime]]'', was a non-series novel.<ref name=\"michael\"/> In 2001, Connelly left California for [[Tampa Bay, Florida]], together with his wife and daughter, so that both he and his wife could be closer to their families. His novels still took place in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"life\"/>\n\nIn 2003, another Bosch novel, ''[[Lost Light]]'', was published. With this book, a CD was released, ''Dark Sacred Night, the Music of Harry Bosch'', featuring some of the jazz music Bosch listens to.<ref name=\"michael\"/> While writing he listens exclusively to instrumental jazz, though, because it does not have intrusive vocals, and because the improvisational playing inspires his writing.<ref name=\"meet\"/> ''[[The Narrows (Connelly novel)|The Narrows]]'', published in 2004, was a sequel to ''The Poet'' but featured Bosch instead of McEvoy.<ref name=\"michael\"/> Together with this book, a DVD was released called ''Blue Neon Night: Michael Connelly's Los Angeles'', in which film Connelly presents some of the places in Los Angeles that are frequently featured in his books.<ref name=\"michael\"/>\n\n''[[The Closers (novel)|The Closers]]'', published in May 2005, was the 11th Bosch novel. It was followed by ''[[The Lincoln Lawyer]]'' in October, Connelly's first legal novel; it features defense attorney [[Mickey Haller]], Bosch's half-brother. The book was made into a film in 2011, starring [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Haller. After releasing ''Crime Beat'' (2006), a non-fiction book about Connelly's experiences as a crime reporter, Connelly went back to Bosch with ''[[Echo Park (novel)|Echo Park]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"michael\"/> This book sets its opening scene in the High Tower Apartment that Connelly rented and wrote from.<ref name=\"life\"/> His next Bosch story, ''[[The Overlook]]'', was originally published as a multi-part series in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. After some editing, it was published as a novel in 2007. In October 2008, Connelly wrote ''[[The Brass Verdict]]'', which brought together Bosch and Haller for the first time.<ref name=\"michael\"/>  He followed that with ''[[The Scarecrow (Michael Connelly novel)|The Scarecrow]]'' (May 2009), which brought back McEvoy as the lead character. ''[[9 Dragons (novel)|9 Dragons]]'', a novel taking Bosch to Hong Kong, was published in October 2009. ''The Reversal'' (October 2010), reunites Bosch & Haller as they work together under the banner of the state on the retrial of a child murderer. The Haller novel ''The Fifth Witness'' was published in 2011.\n\n''[[The Drop (Connelly novel)|The Drop]]'', which refers in part to the \"Deferred Retirement Option Plan\" that was described in the novel ''[[The Brass Verdict]]'' (2008),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304569504576405813466095564 |title=The (Really) Long Goodbye|author=Alter, Alexandra |date= July 1, 2011|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] Friday Journal}}</ref> was published in November 2011. The next Bosch novel was [[The Black Box (novel)|''The Black Box'']] (2012). Connelly's subsequent novel, a legal thriller, was a return to Haller: ''[[The Gods of Guilt]]'' (2013).

Even events that might not be considered as world-changing are included in some of the books, because they are of personal interest to Connelly. For example, in ''City of Bones'', Detective Bosch investigates the murder of an 11-year-old boy. This was written during Connelly's early years as a father of a daughter, and it hit close to home. According to Connelly, he didn't mean to write about the biggest fear of his life; it just came out that way.<ref name=\"author\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/connelly.html |title=Michael Connelly |publisher=Powells.com |accessdate=2012-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715000141/http://www.powells.com/authors/connelly.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n\nDetective Bosch's life usually changes in harmony with Connelly's own life. When Connelly moved 3,000 miles across the country from [[Florida]], Bosch had some life-changing experiences that sent him in a new direction in the book written at that time, ''City of Bones''. According to Connelly, his \"real\" job is to write about Bosch,<ref name=\"author\"/> and his purpose in bringing McCaleb and Bosch together in ''[[A Darkness More Than Night]]'' was to use McCaleb as a tool to look at Bosch from another perspective and keep the character interesting.<ref name=\"author\"/>\n\n==Recurring characters==\nEvery character in the list below, with one exception, has appeared in a Harry Bosch book.

A 2018 study found that bats have a dampened [[Stimulator of interferon genes|STING response]] compared to other mammals, which could allow them to respond to viral threats without over-responding. Additionally, bats lack several [[inflammasome]]s found in other mammals. While inflammation is an immune response to viruses, excessive inflammation is damaging to the body, and viruses like [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus]] (SARS-CoV) are known to kill humans by inducing excessive inflammation. The authors stated, \"The nature of the weakened, but not entirely lost, functionality of STING may have profound impact for bats to maintain the balanced state of 'effective response' but not 'over response' against viruses.\"<ref name=\"Xie\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.chom.2018.01.006|title=Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats|year=2018|last1=Xie|first1=Jiazheng|last2=Li|first2=Yang|last3=Shen|first3=Xurui|last4=Goh|first4=Geraldine|last5=Zhu|first5=Yan|last6=Cui|first6=Jie|last7=Wang|first7=Lin-Fa|last8=Shi|first8=Zheng-Li|last9=Zhou|first9=Peng|journal=Cell Host & Microbe|volume=23|issue=3|pages=297\u2013301.e4|pmid=29478775}}</ref>\n\nBats have also been shown to be more susceptible to reinfection with the same viruses, whereas other mammals, especially humans, have a greater propensity for developing varying degrees of immunity.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/rmv.314|title=Persistence of arboviruses and antiviral antibodies in vertebrate hosts: its occurrence and impacts|year=2001|last1=Kuno|first1=Goro|journal=Reviews in Medical Virology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=165\u2013190|pmid=11376480}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0145-305x(91)90034-v|title=Analysis of immunocompetent cells in the bat, Pteropus giganteus: Isolation and scanning electron microscopic characterization|year=1991|last1=Sarkar|first1=Saurav K.|last2=Chakravarty|first2=Ashim K.|journal=Developmental & Comparative Immunology|volume=15|issue=4|pages=423\u2013430|pmid=1773865}}</ref> Their behavior and life history also make them \"exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents\", with long lifespans, the ability to enter [[torpor]] or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement.<ref name=\"Calisher\"/>\n\nBats and their viruses may be the subject of more research than viruses found in other mammal [[order (biology)|orders]], an example of research bias. A 2015 review found that from 1999 to 2013, there were 300&ndash;1200 papers published about bat viruses annually, compared to 12&ndash;45 publications for [[marsupial]] viruses and only 1&ndash;9 studies for [[sloth]] viruses.

In Bangladesh, the primary mode of transmission of Nipah virus to humans is through the consumption of [[date palm sap]]. Pots set out to collect the sap are contaminated with flying fox urine and feces, and the bats also lick the sap streams flowing into the pots. It has been speculated that the virus may also be transmitted to humans by eating fruit partially consumed by flying foxes, or by coming into contact with their urine, though no definitive evidence supports this.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0950268819000086|title=Nipah virus infection: A review|year=2019|last1=Aditi|last2=Shariff|first2=M.|journal=Epidemiology and Infection|volume=147|pages=e95|pmid=30869046|pmc=6518547}}</ref>\n\nAn additional zoonotic paramyxovirus that bats harbor is [[Menangle virus]], which was first identified at a hog farm in [[New South Wales, Australia]].
