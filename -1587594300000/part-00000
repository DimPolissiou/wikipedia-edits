He was president of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] from 1945 until his death in 1954.

He participated in the [[1927 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name=obit/>\n\nWilbur Shaw won the [[Indianapolis 500]] race three times, in 1937, 1939 and 1940. Shaw was the second person to win the 500 three times, and the first to win it twice in a row.<ref name=obit/> In the 1941 race, Shaw was injured when his car crashed; it was later discovered that a defective wheel had been placed on his car.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Shaw was hired by the tire manufacturer [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] to test a [[synthetic rubber]] automobile tire at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], which had been closed due to the war. He was dismayed at the dilapidated condition of the racetrack and quickly contacted then-owner [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the [[World War I]] flying ace and president and founder of [[Eastern Air Lines]]. When the United States entered [[World War II]], ending racing at Indianapolis and elsewhere for the duration, Rickenbacker padlocked the gates and let the race course slowly begin to disintegrate.\n\nDuring a meeting soon after the tire test, Rickenbacker informed Shaw that what was left of the track would be demolished and the land turned into a housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]]. Shaw sent out letters to the major car manufacturers trying to find a backer to buy the speedway. However, all indicated that should they buy the IMS they would turn it into a private testing facility for their own cars only.\n\nShaw then met [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]] businessman [[Tony Hulman]] who had inherited his family's business, [[Hulman & Company]], a wholesale grocer and producer of coffee and baking powder, [[Clabber Girl]].\n\nA lifelong fan of automobile racing in general and the \"500\" in particular, Hulman listened with great interest to what Shaw had to say. Despite what Hulman saw amongst the weeds and deterioration when Shaw took him to Indianapolis, he purchased the Speedway from Rickenbacker in November 1945 for the sum of $750,000.\n\nAs a reward for his efforts to revive the Speedway, Shaw was appointed as its president, where he would have complete day-to-day control over the track. To this job, Shaw brought his extensive knowledge of the business of auto racing, something Hulman would admit that he himself didn't have, and Shaw's hard work only cemented the reputation of the \"500\" as the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\"\n\nIt seemed as though Shaw and Hulman had a \"Midas touch\" at the Speedway. Hulman poured money into improvements, and Shaw delivered the world's greatest automobile race to enthusiastic crowds, which grew in number by the year. The Indianapolis \"500\" of the late Forties and early Fifties was a very special event through the work of Hulman and Shaw, although Hulman was always sure to point out that it was Wilbur putting it all together.\n\nShaw was killed in an airplane crash near [[Decatur, Indiana]], on October 30, 1954, one day before his fifty-second birthday. The pilot, Ray Grimes, and artist Ernest Roose were also killed.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |coauthors= |title=Wilbur Shaw Is Killed In Indiana Plane Crash  |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p7RhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7MwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3376,5189763&dq=wilbur+shaw&hl=en |quote=Shaw began racing on dirt tracks in his teens and made his first appearance at the Indianapolis track in 1927 He came in fourth in that first race. ... |newspaper=[[Palm Beach Post]] |date=October 31, 1954 |accessdate=2012-10-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAs the automotive test evaluator, Shaw's articles were superior to those of his contemporaries in that they gave consistently accurate reports without relying on ''Popular Science'''s lead in the marketplace over competitors such as ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]''.\n\nShaw's highly regarded autobiography, \"Gentlemen, Start your Engines,\" was published in 1955, and covers events through 1953.\n\n==Indianapolis 500 results==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Car\n!Start\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!Finish\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Retired\n|-\n![[1927 Indianapolis 500|1927]]\n|29\n|19\n|104.465\n|32\n|4\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1928 Indianapolis 500|1928]]\n|1\n|29\n|100.956\n|25\n|25\n|42\n|0\n|Timing gears\n|-\n![[1930 Indianapolis 500|1930]]\n|3\n|25\n|106.135\n|5\n|24\n|54\n|0\n|Wrist pin\n|-\n![[1932 Indianapolis 500|1932]]\n|3\n|22\n|114.326\n|5\n|17\n|157\n|27\n|Rear axle\n|-\n![[1933 Indianapolis 500|1933]]\n|17\n|23\n|115.497\n|12\n|2\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1934 Indianapolis 500|1934]]\n|3\n|2\n|117.647\n|3\n|28\n|15\n|0\n|Lost oil\n|-\n![[1935 Indianapolis 500|1935]]\n|14\n|20\n|116.854\n|7\n|2\n|200\n|5\n|Running\n|-\n![[1936 Indianapolis 500|1936]]\n|3\n|9\n|117.503\n|4\n|7\n|200\n|51\n|Running\n|-\n![[1937 Indianapolis 500|1937]]\n|6\n|2\n|122.791\n|4\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|131\n|Running\n|-\n![[1938 Indianapolis 500|1938]]\n|1\n|7\n|120.987\n|13\n|2\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1939 Indianapolis 500|1939]]\n|2\n|3\n|128.977\n|4\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|51\n|Running\n|-\n![[1940 Indianapolis 500|1940]]\n|1\n|2\n|127.065\n|2\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|136\n|Running\n|-\n![[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941]]\n|2\n|3\n|127.836\n|3\n|18\n|151\n|107\n|Crash T1\n|-\n|colspan=6|'''Totals'''\n|2019\n|508\n|\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Starts\n|13\n|-\n!Poles\n|0\n|-\n!Front Row\n|5\n|-\n!Wins\n|3\n|-\n!Top 5\n|7\n|-\n!Top 10\n|8\n|-\n!Retired\n|5\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Awards==\n*Shaw was inducted into the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Auto Racing Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] in 1963.\n*He was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991.\n*He was named to the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] in 1990.\n*Shaw was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/wilbur-shaw.html Wilbur Shaw] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mittman, Dick (2004).

He participated in the [[1927 Indianapolis 500]].<ref name=obit/>\n\nWilbur Shaw won the [[Indianapolis 500]] race three times, in 1937, 1939 and 1940. Shaw was the second person to win the 500 three times, and the first to win it twice in a row.<ref name=obit/> In the 1941 race, Shaw was injured when his car crashed; it was later discovered that a defective wheel had been placed on his car.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Shaw was hired by the tire manufacturer [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] to test a [[synthetic rubber]] automobile tire at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], which had been closed due to the war. He was dismayed at the dilapidated condition of the racetrack and quickly contacted then-owner [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], the [[World War I]] flying ace and president and founder of [[Eastern Air Lines]]. When the United States entered [[World War II]], ending racing at Indianapolis and elsewhere for the duration, Rickenbacker padlocked the gates and let the race course slowly begin to disintegrate.\n\nDuring a meeting soon after the tire test, Rickenbacker informed Shaw that what was left of the track would be demolished and the land turned into a housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]]. Shaw sent out letters to the major car manufacturers trying to find a backer to buy the speedway. However, all indicated that should they buy the IMS they would turn it into a private testing facility for their own cars only.\n\nShaw then met [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]] businessman [[Tony Hulman]] who had inherited his family's business, [[Hulman & Company]], a wholesale grocer and producer of coffee and baking powder, [[Clabber Girl]].\n\nA lifelong fan of automobile racing in general and the \"500\" in particular, Hulman listened with great interest to what Shaw had to say. Despite what Hulman saw amongst the weeds and deterioration when Shaw took him to Indianapolis, he purchased the Speedway from Rickenbacker in November 1945 for the sum of $750,000.\n\nAs a reward for his efforts to revive the Speedway, Shaw was appointed as its president, where he would have complete day-to-day control over the track. To this job, Shaw brought his extensive knowledge of the business of auto racing, something Hulman would admit that he himself didn't have, and Shaw's hard work only cemented the reputation of the \"500\" as the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\"\n\nIt seemed as though Shaw and Hulman had a \"Midas touch\" at the Speedway. Hulman poured money into improvements, and Shaw delivered the world's greatest automobile race to enthusiastic crowds, which grew in number by the year. The Indianapolis \"500\" of the late Forties and early Fifties was a very special event through the work of Hulman and Shaw, although Hulman was always sure to point out that it was Wilbur putting it all together.\n\nShaw was killed in an airplane crash near [[Decatur, Indiana]], on October 30, 1954, one day before his fifty-second birthday. The pilot, Ray Grimes, and artist Ernest Roose were also killed.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author=[[Associated Press]] |coauthors= |title=Wilbur Shaw Is Killed In Indiana Plane Crash  |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p7RhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7MwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3376,5189763&dq=wilbur+shaw&hl=en |quote=Shaw began racing on dirt tracks in his teens and made his first appearance at the Indianapolis track in 1927 He came in fourth in that first race. ... |newspaper=[[Palm Beach Post]] |date=October 31, 1954 |accessdate=2012-10-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAs the automotive test evaluator, Shaw's articles were superior to those of his contemporaries in that they gave consistently accurate reports without relying on ''Popular Science'''s lead in the marketplace over competitors such as ''[[Mechanix Illustrated]]''.\n\nShaw's highly regarded autobiography, \"Gentlemen, Start your Engines,\" was published in 1955, and covers events through 1953.\n\n==Indianapolis 500 results==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Car\n!Start\n!Qual\n!Rank\n!Finish\n!Laps\n!Led\n!Retired\n|-\n![[1927 Indianapolis 500|1927]]\n|29\n|19\n|104.465\n|32\n|4\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1928 Indianapolis 500|1928]]\n|1\n|29\n|100.956\n|25\n|25\n|42\n|0\n|Timing gears\n|-\n![[1930 Indianapolis 500|1930]]\n|3\n|25\n|106.135\n|5\n|24\n|54\n|0\n|Wrist pin\n|-\n![[1932 Indianapolis 500|1932]]\n|3\n|22\n|114.326\n|5\n|17\n|157\n|27\n|Rear axle\n|-\n![[1933 Indianapolis 500|1933]]\n|17\n|23\n|115.497\n|12\n|2\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1934 Indianapolis 500|1934]]\n|3\n|2\n|117.647\n|3\n|28\n|15\n|0\n|Lost oil\n|-\n![[1935 Indianapolis 500|1935]]\n|14\n|20\n|116.854\n|7\n|2\n|200\n|5\n|Running\n|-\n![[1936 Indianapolis 500|1936]]\n|3\n|9\n|117.503\n|4\n|7\n|200\n|51\n|Running\n|-\n![[1937 Indianapolis 500|1937]]\n|6\n|2\n|122.791\n|4\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|131\n|Running\n|-\n![[1938 Indianapolis 500|1938]]\n|1\n|7\n|120.987\n|13\n|2\n|200\n|0\n|Running\n|-\n![[1939 Indianapolis 500|1939]]\n|2\n|3\n|128.977\n|4\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|51\n|Running\n|-\n![[1940 Indianapolis 500|1940]]\n|1\n|2\n|127.065\n|2\n|style=\"background:green;color:white\"|1\n|200\n|136\n|Running\n|-\n![[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941]]\n|2\n|3\n|127.836\n|3\n|18\n|151\n|107\n|Crash T1\n|-\n|colspan=6|'''Totals'''\n|2019\n|508\n|\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Starts\n|13\n|-\n!Poles\n|0\n|-\n!Front Row\n|5\n|-\n!Wins\n|3\n|-\n!Top 5\n|7\n|-\n!Top 10\n|8\n|-\n!Retired\n|5\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Awards==\n*Shaw was inducted into the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Auto Racing Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] in 1963.\n*He was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991.\n*He was named to the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame & Museum|National Sprint Car Hall of Fame]] in 1990.\n*Shaw was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/wilbur-shaw.html Wilbur Shaw] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Mittman, Dick (2004).

He became a distinguished [[hydrographer]] during his career and served as [[Hydrographer of the Navy]].\n\n==Biography==\nEvans, son of John Evans, a [[Master (naval)|master]] in the Royal Navy, was born on 9 March 1815. He entered the navy as a second-class volunteer in 1828. After serving in {{HMS|Rose|1821|6}} and {{HMS|Winchester|1822|6}} he was transferred in 1833 to {{HMS|Thunder|1829|6}}, under Captain Richard Owen, and spent three years in surveying the coasts of Central America, the [[Demerara River]], and the [[Bahama Banks]].

In 1841 Evans was appointed master of {{HMS|Fly|1831|6}}, and for the next five years he was employed in surveying the [[Coral Sea]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] of Australia, and [[Torres Straits]]<ref name=obituary>{{cite journal|title=Captain Sir Frederick J.O.

Boone|place=London|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/59237#/summary}}</ref>.\n\nAfter a short spell of duty in the [[Isle of Man]], Evans returned, in 1847, in {{HMS|Acheron|1838|6}}, under Admiral Stokes, to [[New Zealand]], where he was engaged for four years in surveying the Middle and [[South Island]]s. During the [[Crimean War]] he served in the [[Baltic Sea]], receiving the special thanks of [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Napier]] for his share in piloting the fleet through the [[\u00c5land Islands]]<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nBy this time Evans had become known for his scientific abilities, and in particular for his work on magnetism. He understood the need for studies of the effects of magnetic materials on ships' compasses at a period when the Navy was being revolutionised by the shift from wooden to iron construction. He had already done considerable work on this problem in the years between 1842 and 1851. In 1855 he was appointed superintendent of the compass department of the navy, and was able to devote himeslf entirely to the problems of the use of the magnetic compass in iron ships and [[ironclad warship|armour-clads]]. Evans, in co-operation with [[Archibald Smith]], accomplished the task satisfactorily. He contributed five papers, all dealing with the magnetism of ships, to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', of which he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|fellow]] in 1862<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nEvans was commissioned a staff-commander in 1863, staff-captain in 1867, and full captain in 1872. In 1865 he was appointed Chief Assistant to the [[Hydrographer of the Navy|Hydrographer to the Admiralty]], Captain [[George Henry Richards]], while continuing to tbe head of the magnetic department. In 1874 he succeeded Richards as Hydrographer, a post he held until 1884<ref name=obituary/>. In this position he was responsible for the charts, pilot guides and other publications of the Admiralty. \n\nHe was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath,<ref>Queen's Honours List, 1873</ref> and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath<ref>Queen'sHonours List, 1881</ref>. He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1879 to 1881, and president of the geographical section of the [[British Association]] in 1876. After resigning the post of hydrographer, Evans was appointed one of the British delegates to the [[International Meridian Conference]] held at Washington, D.C. in 1885, to fix a [[prime meridian]] and universal day<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nHe died at his residence, 21 Dawson Place, Pembridge Square, London, on 20 December 1885. He had married, on 12 November 1846, Elizabeth Mary, eldest daughter of Captain Charles Hall, R.N., of [[Plymouth]].\n\n==Published Work==\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 2598 Chart of the curves of equal magnetic variation, 1858. RMG F0098, Published 1859.tiff|thumb|Evans' chart of the curves of equal magnetic variation, published 1859]]\nFollowing the survey work in New Zealand in ''Acheron'', and the subsequent work by Commander [[Byron Drury]] in {{HMS|Pandora|1833|6}}, Richards and Evans published the 'New Zealand Pilot' in 1856. This went through a number of editions, the fourth appearing in 1875. In 1858 Evans prepared a \u2018Chart of Curves of Equal Magnetic Variation,\u2019 which was published by the [[Admiralty]]. In 1860 he wrote a valuable \u2018Report on Compass Deviations in the Royal Navy\u2019. This treated of the magnetic character of the various iron ships in the navy, and also of the {{SS|Great Eastern}}, and was his first work to be published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. His most important work was the \u2018Admiralty Manual for Deviations of the Compass,\u2019 of which Smith and himself were joint editors (1st ed. 1862, 2nd ed. 1863, 3rd ed. 1869). A simple account of the same subject was issued by Evans in 1870 as an \u2018Elementary Manual for Deviations of the Compass.\u2019 These have become standard textbooks, having been translated and adopted by all the great maritime nations.\n\nHis published work in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appeared between 1860-1872. Subsequently Evans devoted much attention to terrestrial magnetism. He compiled the magnetical instructions for the observers on board {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} in 1872<ref name=obituary/>, and delivered a lecture on the \u2018Magnetism of the Earth\u2019 to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1878. In 1881 he contributed a paper to the British Association on \u2018Oceanic or Maritime Discovery from 1831 to 1881.\u2019\n\n==List of Publications==\n===Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society===\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=Reduction and Discussion of the Deviations of the Compass Observed on Board of All the Iron-Built Ships, and a Selection of the Wood-Built Steam-Ships in Her Majesty's Navy, and the Iron Steam-Ship 'Great Eastern'; Being a Report to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1860 |volume=150 |pages=337\u2013338 |jstor=108776 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1860.0021 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Archibald |last2=Evans |first2=Frederick J. |title=On the Effect Produced on the Deviations of the Compass by the Length and Arrangement of the Compass-Needles; and on a New Mode of Correcting the Quadrantal Deviation |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1861 |volume=151 |pages=161\u2013181 |jstor=108732 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1861.0010 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |last2=Smith |first2=Archibald |title=On the magnetic character of the armour-plated ships of the royal navy, and on the effect on the compass of particular arrangements of iron in a ship |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1865 |volume=155 |pages=263\u2013323 |url=https://archive.org/details/evans1865philosophicaltra1551roya|doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0005 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=On the Amount and Changes of the Polar Magnetism at Certain Positions in Her Majesty's Iron-Built and Armour-Plated Ship 'Northumberland' |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1868 |volume=158 |pages=487\u2013503 |jstor=108923 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1868.0020 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=On the present amount of westerly magnetic declination [variation of the compass] on the coast of Great Britain, and its annual changes |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1872 |volume=162 |pages=319\u2013330 |url=https://archive.org/details/evans1872philosophicaltrans|doi=10.1098/rstl.1872.0014 |doi-access=free }}\n\n===Other Publications===\n* {{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=G.H. |last2=Evans |first2=F.J. |title=The New Zealand Pilot |date=1856 |publisher=Hydrographic Office, Admiralty |location=London|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1720&page=0&action=null}}.

Boone|place=London|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/59237#/summary}}</ref>.\n\nAfter a short spell of duty in the [[Isle of Man]], Evans returned, in 1847, in {{HMS|Acheron|1838|6}}, under Admiral Stokes, to [[New Zealand]], where he was engaged for four years in surveying the Middle and [[South Island]]s. During the [[Crimean War]] he served in the [[Baltic Sea]], receiving the special thanks of [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Napier]] for his share in piloting the fleet through the [[\u00c5land Islands]]<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nBy this time Evans had become known for his scientific abilities, and in particular for his work on magnetism. He understood the need for studies of the effects of magnetic materials on ships' compasses at a period when the Navy was being revolutionised by the shift from wooden to iron construction. He had already done considerable work on this problem in the years between 1842 and 1851. In 1855 he was appointed superintendent of the compass department of the navy, and was able to devote himeslf entirely to the problems of the use of the magnetic compass in iron ships and [[ironclad warship|armour-clads]]. Evans, in co-operation with [[Archibald Smith]], accomplished the task satisfactorily. He contributed five papers, all dealing with the magnetism of ships, to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', of which he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|fellow]] in 1862<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nEvans was commissioned a staff-commander in 1863, staff-captain in 1867, and full captain in 1872. In 1865 he was appointed Chief Assistant to the [[Hydrographer of the Navy|Hydrographer to the Admiralty]], Captain [[George Henry Richards]], while continuing to tbe head of the magnetic department. In 1874 he succeeded Richards as Hydrographer, a post he held until 1884<ref name=obituary/>. In this position he was responsible for the charts, pilot guides and other publications of the Admiralty. \n\nHe was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath,<ref>Queen's Honours List, 1873</ref> and promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath<ref>Queen'sHonours List, 1881</ref>. He was vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1879 to 1881, and president of the geographical section of the [[British Association]] in 1876. After resigning the post of hydrographer, Evans was appointed one of the British delegates to the [[International Meridian Conference]] held at Washington, D.C. in 1885, to fix a [[prime meridian]] and universal day<ref name=obituary/>.\n\nHe died at his residence, 21 Dawson Place, Pembridge Square, London, on 20 December 1885. He had married, on 12 November 1846, Elizabeth Mary, eldest daughter of Captain Charles Hall, R.N., of [[Plymouth]].\n\n==Published Work==\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 2598 Chart of the curves of equal magnetic variation, 1858. RMG F0098, Published 1859.tiff|thumb|Evans' chart of the curves of equal magnetic variation, published 1859]]\nFollowing the survey work in New Zealand in ''Acheron'', and the subsequent work by Commander [[Byron Drury]] in {{HMS|Pandora|1833|6}}, Richards and Evans published the 'New Zealand Pilot' in 1856. This went through a number of editions, the fourth appearing in 1875. In 1858 Evans prepared a \u2018Chart of Curves of Equal Magnetic Variation,\u2019 which was published by the [[Admiralty]]. In 1860 he wrote a valuable \u2018Report on Compass Deviations in the Royal Navy\u2019. This treated of the magnetic character of the various iron ships in the navy, and also of the {{SS|Great Eastern}}, and was his first work to be published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. His most important work was the \u2018Admiralty Manual for Deviations of the Compass,\u2019 of which Smith and himself were joint editors (1st ed. 1862, 2nd ed. 1863, 3rd ed. 1869). A simple account of the same subject was issued by Evans in 1870 as an \u2018Elementary Manual for Deviations of the Compass.\u2019 These have become standard textbooks, having been translated and adopted by all the great maritime nations.\n\nHis published work in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society appeared between 1860-1872. Subsequently Evans devoted much attention to terrestrial magnetism. He compiled the magnetical instructions for the observers on board {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} in 1872<ref name=obituary/>, and delivered a lecture on the \u2018Magnetism of the Earth\u2019 to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1878. In 1881 he contributed a paper to the British Association on \u2018Oceanic or Maritime Discovery from 1831 to 1881.\u2019\n\n==List of Publications==\n===Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society===\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=Reduction and Discussion of the Deviations of the Compass Observed on Board of All the Iron-Built Ships, and a Selection of the Wood-Built Steam-Ships in Her Majesty's Navy, and the Iron Steam-Ship 'Great Eastern'; Being a Report to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1860 |volume=150 |pages=337\u2013338 |jstor=108776 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1860.0021 }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Archibald |last2=Evans |first2=Frederick J. |title=On the Effect Produced on the Deviations of the Compass by the Length and Arrangement of the Compass-Needles; and on a New Mode of Correcting the Quadrantal Deviation |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1861 |volume=151 |pages=161\u2013181 |jstor=108732 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1861.0010 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |last2=Smith |first2=Archibald |title=On the magnetic character of the armour-plated ships of the royal navy, and on the effect on the compass of particular arrangements of iron in a ship |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1865 |volume=155 |pages=263\u2013323 |url=https://archive.org/details/evans1865philosophicaltra1551roya|doi=10.1098/rstl.1865.0005 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=On the Amount and Changes of the Polar Magnetism at Certain Positions in Her Majesty's Iron-Built and Armour-Plated Ship 'Northumberland' |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1868 |volume=158 |pages=487\u2013503 |jstor=108923 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1868.0020 |doi-access=free }}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Evans |first1=Frederick J. |title=On the present amount of westerly magnetic declination [variation of the compass] on the coast of Great Britain, and its annual changes |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1872 |volume=162 |pages=319\u2013330 |url=https://archive.org/details/evans1872philosophicaltrans|doi=10.1098/rstl.1872.0014 |doi-access=free }}\n\n===Other Publications===\n* {{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=G.H. |last2=Evans |first2=F.J. |title=The New Zealand Pilot |date=1856 |publisher=Hydrographic Office, Admiralty |location=London|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document/?wid=1720&page=0&action=null}}.

In 1946, the Division of Thoracic Surgery, today the Duke Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, was organized by [[Josiah Charles Trent]]. In 1947, the Bell Research Building became the first freestanding building on the hospital campus. In 1954, the Duke [[Poison Control Center]] was organized, becoming one of the first two organized in the country.\n\nIn 1955, psychiatrist Ewald W. Busse established the Duke University Center for Aging, the first research center of its kind in the nation.<ref name=Aging1955>{{cite journal |title=Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development: History of the center. |author=Maddox, George L |url=http://www.geri.duke.edu/images/media/history/center-history.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Currently the oldest continuously operating facility in the United States, this center has pioneered long-term studies of health problems among seniors.\n\nIn 1956, Duke surgeons performed the first [[cardiac surgery]] using systemic [[hypothermia]] to bring a patient's body temperature down to less than 50 [[Degree (temperature)|degree]]s Fahrenheit in an effort to minimize tissue damage during lengthy surgeries. With the success of this experiment, systemic hypothermia has become standard procedure in all hospitals worldwide. In 1957, the hospital and medical school were renamed Duke University Medical Center. In 1958, Thelma Ingles, a professor and chair of the Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, developed the clinical nursing specialist program, becoming the first master's program of its kind in the United States. The establishment of the nursing specialist program paved the way for advanced clinical knowledge in the delivery and teaching of the nursing field.\n\nThe 1960s brought extraordinary firsts to Duke. In 1963, the first [[African-American]] student was accepted to the prestigious medical school. Two years later, in 1965, the hospital established the first [[physician assistant]] program in the country. In 1966, Duke became the first medical center in the world to offer radio consultation with physicians in developing countries. This program, called Med-Aid (short for Medical Assistance for Isolated Doctors), met the critical needs of the physicians who lacked proper treatment.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} That same year, the Medical Scientist Training Program, a joint program leading to simultaneous M.D. and Ph.D [[Academic degree|degree]]s, was established, becoming one of the first three in the nation. In 1969, the first recorded studies of human's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a 1,000-foot (300 m) deep sea dive were conducted in the [[hyperbaric chamber]].<ref name=CamporesiDAN>{{cite journal |author=Camporesi, Enrico M |title=The Atlantis Series and Other Deep Dives. |journal=In: Moon RE, Piantadosi CA, Camporesi EM (eds.).

In December 1971, the [[Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center]] was established under the [[National Cancer Act]].  Duke's cancer center, one of the first in the nation under this groundbreaking legislation, was officially designated as a \"comprehensive\" cancer center by the [[National Cancer Institute]] in 1973.  That same year, the Duke Eye Center was dedicated and opened on November 8.  In 1978, the Morris Cancer Research Building opened, giving researchers a place to study and find cures for the disease.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the hospital also faced two distinct [[Duke University Hospital Unionization Drives|unionization drives]] aimed at uniting the unskilled service workers of Duke Hospital. The 1974 and 1978 drives both ultimately failed, and the 1980s ushered in a twenty-year low in organizing and activism at the hospital.<ref name=Brodkin>{{cite book|last=Brodkin|first=Karen|title=Caring By The Hour|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, IL|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Duke moved into its present $94.5 million facility (Duke North) on Erwin Road, located just north of its original location.  In 1985, with the emergence of [[AIDS]] bringing alarm to the medical community, Duke became one of the first two hospitals to conduct human clinical trials on [[Zidovudine|AZT]], the first drug to offer an improved quality of life in patients battling AIDS.\n\n=== 1990\u2013present: accelerated growth, expansion, and a glance towards the future ===\n\nIn the 1990s, the medical research at Duke reached the forefront for detection of ailments that can be treated with a larger success rate.  In 1990, Duke [[geneticist]]s invented a three-minute test to screen [[newborn]]s for over 30 [[metabolic disease]]s at one time.  This practice has since become standard worldwide.\n\nIn 1992, Duke's cancer center became the first hospital to develop an outpatient [[bone marrow transplant]] program.  That same year, the hospital performed its first lung and heart/lung transplants.\n\nThe year 1994 marked the beginning of accelerated expansion for Duke.  That year, the [[Levine Science Research Center]] and the Medical Sciences Research Center were opened.  In addition, there were extensive renovations of the Duke Clinic (Duke South), additions to the Morris Cancer Research Building, a new Children's Health Center, a freestanding Ambulatory Care Center, and expanded parking options for visitors.\n\nIn 1998, the [[Duke University Health System]] was created with newly established partnerships with [[Durham Regional Hospital]] and [[Duke University Health System#Duke Raleigh Hospital|Raleigh Community Hospital]].  That same year, the [[National Institutes of Health]] partnered with Duke to offer the first joint master's of health science in clinical research degree.  With this extraordinary partnership, the NIH became the first organization to offer a joint graduate degree program with a major university.\n\nIn 2001, the hospital was the first to establish a center dedicated exclusively to [[Cardiovascular]] [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]].\n\nIn 2019, a team at the hospital became the first in the United States to transplant an adult heart into a recipient through a process known as donation after circulatory death.\n\nToday, Duke University Hospital is still seeking life-changing breakthroughs to improve the quality of life for everyone in the world.  In addition, the hospital is undergoing a major expansion project that will increase the size of its surgical ward and add two additional helipads to the hospital.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Heidi Wunderli-Allenspach]] (born 1947), Swiss biologist and first women rektor of ETH Zurich\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rebecca Buckley]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dukehealth.org/locations/duke_hospital Duke University Hospital]\n\n{{Duke University}}\n{{North Carolina Trauma Centers}}\n{{coord|36.0072|-78.9373|region:US-NC_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1930]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1980]]\n[[Category:Duke University campus|Hospital]]\n[[Category:Hospitals in Durham, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Teaching hospitals in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox hospital\n| Name        = Duke University Hospital\n| Org/Group   = [[Duke University Health System]]\n| Image       =\n| Caption     =\n| map_type    = \n| latitude    = <!-- used only for adding a map, with map_type -->\n| longitude   = <!-- used only for adding a map, with map_type -->\n| Logo        = Duke University Symbol.svg\n| Logo Size   = 175px\n| Location    = \n| Region      = [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]\n| State       = [[North Carolina]]\n| Country     = US\n| Coordinates = \n| HealthCare  =\n| Type        = Teaching\n| Speciality  =\n| Standards   = <!-- optional if no national standards -->\n| Emergency   = I\n| Affiliation = [[Duke University School of Medicine|Duke University]]\n| Patron      = <!-- 'None' or the individual who acts as the hospital patron -->\n| Beds        = 957\n| Founded     = 1925 as a gift from [[James Buchanan Duke|James B.

In 1931, the hospital and medical school were officially dedicated on April 20 and the Private Diagnostic Clinic (Duke's in-house physician system) was organized on September 16.<ref name=Dedication1931>{{cite journal |title=Dedication of Duke University School of Medicine and Duke Hospital, Durham, North Carolina, April 20, 1931 |journal=Southern Medical Journal, Journal of the Southern Medical Association |volume=24 |issue=12 |date=1931=12 |pages=1099\u20131124 |url=http://archives.mc.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/1931_smj_dedication_master.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305083017/http://archives.mc.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/1931_smj_dedication_master.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2011 }}</ref> In 1935, less than five years after the hospital opened, the [[American Medical Association]] ranked Duke among the top 20 of medical schools in the country.<ref name=archiveHx/>\n\n=== 1936\u20131969: a number of firsts ===\n\nIn 1936, a team of physicians led by Dr. [[Julian Deryl Hart]] introduced [[ultraviolet light]] to kill [[germ theory of disease|germs]] in the operating room as a way to combat post-operative [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]]s, greatly reducing the number of infections and related deaths.<ref name=Time1936>{{cite magazine |title=Medicine: Germicidal Light |magazine=[[Time Magazine]] |date=1936-06-15 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756311,00.html |accessdate=2011-03-17}}</ref> In the same year, the hospital established the nation's first [[brain tumor]] program, launching what would become one of the world's most renowned programs in the field of [[cancer]] treatment.

In 1946, the Division of Thoracic Surgery, today the Duke Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, was organized by [[Josiah Charles Trent]]. In 1947, the Bell Research Building became the first freestanding building on the hospital campus. In 1954, the Duke [[Poison Control Center]] was organized, becoming one of the first two organized in the country.\n\nIn 1955, psychiatrist Ewald W. Busse established the Duke University Center for Aging, the first research center of its kind in the nation.<ref name=Aging1955>{{cite journal |title=Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development: History of the center. |author=Maddox, George L |url=http://www.geri.duke.edu/images/media/history/center-history.pdf |accessdate=2011-03-17 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Currently the oldest continuously operating facility in the United States, this center has pioneered long-term studies of health problems among seniors.\n\nIn 1956, Duke surgeons performed the first [[cardiac surgery]] using systemic [[hypothermia]] to bring a patient's body temperature down to less than 50 [[Degree (temperature)|degree]]s Fahrenheit in an effort to minimize tissue damage during lengthy surgeries. With the success of this experiment, systemic hypothermia has become standard procedure in all hospitals worldwide. In 1957, the hospital and medical school were renamed Duke University Medical Center. In 1958, Thelma Ingles, a professor and chair of the Department of Medical-Surgical Nursing, developed the clinical nursing specialist program, becoming the first master's program of its kind in the United States. The establishment of the nursing specialist program paved the way for advanced clinical knowledge in the delivery and teaching of the nursing field.\n\nThe 1960s brought extraordinary firsts to Duke. In 1963, the first [[African-American]] student was accepted to the prestigious medical school. Two years later, in 1965, the hospital established the first [[physician assistant]] program in the country. In 1966, Duke became the first medical center in the world to offer radio consultation with physicians in developing countries. This program, called Med-Aid (short for Medical Assistance for Isolated Doctors), met the critical needs of the physicians who lacked proper treatment.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} That same year, the Medical Scientist Training Program, a joint program leading to simultaneous M.D. and Ph.D [[Academic degree|degree]]s, was established, becoming one of the first three in the nation. In 1969, the first recorded studies of human's abilities to function and work at pressures equal to a 1,000-foot (300 m) deep sea dive were conducted in the [[hyperbaric chamber]].<ref name=CamporesiDAN>{{cite journal |author=Camporesi, Enrico M |title=The Atlantis Series and Other Deep Dives. |journal=In: Moon RE, Piantadosi CA, Camporesi EM (eds.).

In December 1971, the [[Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center]] was established under the [[National Cancer Act]].  Duke's cancer center, one of the first in the nation under this groundbreaking legislation, was officially designated as a \"comprehensive\" cancer center by the [[National Cancer Institute]] in 1973.  That same year, the Duke Eye Center was dedicated and opened on November 8.  In 1978, the Morris Cancer Research Building opened, giving researchers a place to study and find cures for the disease.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the hospital also faced two distinct [[Duke University Hospital Unionization Drives|unionization drives]] aimed at uniting the unskilled service workers of Duke Hospital. The 1974 and 1978 drives both ultimately failed, and the 1980s ushered in a twenty-year low in organizing and activism at the hospital.<ref name=Brodkin>{{cite book|last=Brodkin|first=Karen|title=Caring By The Hour|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, IL|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Duke moved into its present $94.5 million facility (Duke North) on Erwin Road, located just north of its original location.  In 1985, with the emergence of [[AIDS]] bringing alarm to the medical community, Duke became one of the first two hospitals to conduct human clinical trials on [[Zidovudine|AZT]], the first drug to offer an improved quality of life in patients battling AIDS.\n\n=== 1990\u2013present: accelerated growth, expansion, and a glance towards the future ===\n\nIn the 1990s, the medical research at Duke reached the forefront for detection of ailments that can be treated with a larger success rate.  In 1990, Duke [[geneticist]]s invented a three-minute test to screen [[newborn]]s for over 30 [[metabolic disease]]s at one time.  This practice has since become standard worldwide.\n\nIn 1992, Duke's cancer center became the first hospital to develop an outpatient [[bone marrow transplant]] program.  That same year, the hospital performed its first lung and heart/lung transplants.\n\nThe year 1994 marked the beginning of accelerated expansion for Duke.  That year, the [[Levine Science Research Center]] and the Medical Sciences Research Center were opened.  In addition, there were extensive renovations of the Duke Clinic (Duke South), additions to the Morris Cancer Research Building, a new Children's Health Center, a freestanding Ambulatory Care Center, and expanded parking options for visitors.\n\nIn 1998, the [[Duke University Health System]] was created with newly established partnerships with [[Durham Regional Hospital]] and [[Duke University Health System#Duke Raleigh Hospital|Raleigh Community Hospital]].  That same year, the [[National Institutes of Health]] partnered with Duke to offer the first joint master's of health science in clinical research degree.  With this extraordinary partnership, the NIH became the first organization to offer a joint graduate degree program with a major university.\n\nIn 2001, the hospital was the first to establish a center dedicated exclusively to [[Cardiovascular]] [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]].\n\nIn 2019, a team at the hospital became the first in the United States to transplant an adult heart into a recipient through a process known as donation after circulatory death.\n\nToday, Duke University Hospital is still seeking life-changing breakthroughs to improve the quality of life for everyone in the world.  In addition, the hospital is undergoing a major expansion project that will increase the size of its surgical ward and add two additional helipads to the hospital.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Heidi Wunderli-Allenspach]] (born 1947), Swiss biologist and first women rektor of ETH Zurich\n==See also==\n*[[Rebecca Buckley]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dukehealth.org/locations/duke_hospital Duke University Hospital]\n\n{{Duke University}}\n{{North Carolina Trauma Centers}}\n{{coord|36.0072|-78.9373|region:US-NC_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1930]]\n[[Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1980]]\n[[Category:Duke University campus|Hospital]]\n[[Category:Hospitals in Durham, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Teaching hospitals in North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University_Hospital"}
