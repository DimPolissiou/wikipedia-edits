Although lieutenants are no longer numbered by seniority, the post of \"first lieutenant\" remains.\n\nIn minor war vessels, [[destroyer]]s and [[frigate]]s, the first lieutenant (either a lieutenant or lieutenant commander) is second in command, [[executive officer]] (XO) and head of the executive branch; in larger ships, where a commander of the warfare specialisation is appointed as the executive officer, a first lieutenant (normally a lieutenant commander) is appointed as his deputy. The post of first lieutenant in a [[shore establishment]] carries a similar responsibility to that of the first lieutenant of a [[capital ship]].\n\nIn the U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard, the billet of first lieutenant describes the officer in charge of the [[deck department]] or division, depending on the size of the ship. In smaller ships that have only a single deck division, the billet is typically filled by an ensign; while in larger ships, with a deck department consisting of multiple subordinate divisions, the billet may be filled by a lieutenant commander.

Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in English-speaking [[North America]] for a depressed street in a city.<ref>[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]]; Beale, Paul (ed.)

Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in English-speaking [[North America]] for a depressed street in a city.<ref>[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]]; Beale, Paul (ed.)

This anthropological focus has led many to compare her fiction to that of [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\nArnason won the inaugural [[James Tiptree Jr. Award]] in 1991 and the [[Mythopoeic Awards|1992 Mythopoeic Award]] for ''[[A Woman of the Iron People]]'' and in 2000 won the [[Gaylactic Spectrum Awards|Gaylactic Spectrum Award for Best Short Fiction]] for \"Dapple\" and the [[Homer Award|HOMer Award]] for her novelette ''Stellar Harvest''.<ref>[http://www.sfadb.com/HOMer_Awards_2000 \"HOMer Awards 2000\" at Science Fiction Awards Database]</ref> ''Stellar Harvest'' was also nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] in 2000. In 2003, she was nominated for two [[Nebula Award]]s for her novella ''Potter of Bones'' and her short story \"Knapsack Poems\". In 2004, she was guest of honor at [[Wiscon]]. She lives in [[Minnesota]].\n\n==Background==\n\nEleanor Arnason is the daughter of [[H. Harvard Arnason]], a Canadian-born man of [[Iceland]]ic descent, who worked as an art historian and became the director of the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1951, and Elizabeth Hickcox Yard Arnason, a social worker by profession who spent her childhood in a missionary community in [[western China]]. Arnason is the niece of the American feminist [[Molly Yard]] and her maternal grandparents were both Methodist missionaries. This [[Methodism|Methodist]] influence would be visible in her works, most notably in ''Ring of Swords''.<ref name=\"tvbookshelf.ws\">http://tvbookshelf.ws/Arnason.mov</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 to 1960, Arnason and her parents lived in Walker's \"Idea House #2\", a futuristic dwelling built next to the Walker Art Center. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516080443/http://www.citypages.com/databank/19/927/article5962.asp] Arnason has said that her experience growing up around [[avant-garde]] artists in a futurist house, in addition to the influence of her feminist, socialist mother contributed to her preoccupation with the future, and consequently science fiction. Prior to 1949, Arnason's family moved frequently: from New York City to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; London; Paris; and St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nShe graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1964, with a B.A. in art history, and continued her education in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, until 1967. She spent the next seven years working as an office clerk in Brooklyn and then Detroit. Her time in these blue-collar, racially diverse areas helped to shape her understanding about class consciousness, conflict, and revolution\u2014notions that are reflected in her works. Arnason moved back to [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] in 1974 and continued to work in offices, warehouses, a large art museum, and more recently, a series of small nonprofits devoted to history, peace, justice, and art.<ref>Arnason, Eleanor. ''Mammoths of the Great Plains'' PM Press. Seattle. 2010. Print</ref>\n\nSince 1994, she has shifted her literary focus from novels to short fiction. She retired in 2009 and now writes full-time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Author Spotlight: Eleanor Arnason |author=Earnie Sotirokos |date=November 2012 |url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-eleanor-arnason/ |work=Lightspeed}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\nThe issues that transpire most in Arnason's life and writings encompass feminism, peace, social justice, support for the union movement and a deep belief that racism and all forms of prejudice should be opposed. [[City Pages]] labelled Arnason as a political radical.<ref>{{cite news|title=State Writes |date=September 9, 1998 |work=[[City Pages]] |location=Minneapolis |url=http://www.citypages.com/news/state-writes-6712740 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132130/http://www.citypages.com/news/state-writes-6712740 |archivedate=2016-01-09 }}</ref>\n\nHaving come of age during [[Second-wave feminism]], Arnason included gender and sexuality as central themes in her work, notably in her collection of {{Not a typo|''hwarhath''}} stories, in which she \"wanted to create a society in which homosexual love was normal and heterosexual love was abnormal, sort of as a thought experiment. And because contemporary Americans have very rigid ideas of what is normal.\"<ref name=\"tvbookshelf.ws\"/> The {{Not a typo|''hwarhath''}} stories also addressed issues of gender roles and reproductive rights.\n\nShe was profoundly affected by the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy period]], particularly because of the ways that children were taught to [[securitization (international relations)|securitize]] against nuclear annihilation. She became involved in the Student Peace Union and attended demonstrations during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. ''Ring of Swords'', Arnason's {{Not a typo|hwarhath}} novel, illustrates peacebuilding after a long war; an endeavor both representative of Arnason's peace beliefs and of the [[make love, not war]] politics of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Arnason went to the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] with her mother. This had a profound impact that would be reflected in her story \"Big Brown Mama and Brer Rabbit\" in which Brer Rabbit transforms into an African-American man in the early 20th century. Arnason has often opted for racially diverse characters, including, but not limited to, a heroine of Chinese descent in ''A Woman of the Iron People'' and a Hispanic heroine in Ring of Swords. In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.\n\nArnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the [[National Writers Union]] and engaging in [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] precinct politics.\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Standalone Novels===\n*''[[The Sword Smith]]'' (1978)\n*''To the Resurrection Station'' (1986)\n*''Daughter of the Bear King'' (1987)\n*Woman of the Iron People series\n**Part 1 ''In the Light of Sigma Draconis'' (1991)\n**Part 2 ''Changing Women'' (1991)\n**''[[A Woman of the Iron People]]'' (1991)\n\n===Standalone Short Stories===\n*\"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" (1973)\n*\"The Warlord of Saturn's Moons\" (1974)\n*\"Ace 167\" (1974)\n*\"The House by the Sea\" (1975)\n*\"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (1976) with [[Ruth Berman]]\n*\"Going Down\" (1977)\n*\"A Ceremony of Discontent\" (1981)\n*\"The Ivory Comb\" (1982)\n*\"Glam's Story\" (1987)\n*\"Among the Featherless Bipeds\" (1988)\n*\"A Brief History of the Order of St. Cyprian the Athlete\" (1992)\n*\"The Dog's Story\" (1996)\n*\"The Venetian Method\" (1998)\n*\"Feeding the Mother: A {{Not a typo|Hwarhath}} Religious Anecdote\" (1998)\n*\"The Grammarian's Five Daughters\" (1999), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130421083220/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040329/grammarian.shtml available online]\n*\"Origin Story\" (2000)\n*\"Moby Quilt\" (2001)\n*\"The Lost Mother: A Story Told by the Divers\" (2002)\n*\"Knapsack Poems\" (2002)\n*\"The Potter of Bones\" (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20101013180312/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0401/bones.shtml available online]\n*\"Big Black mama and Tentacle Man\" (2003)\n*\"Big Ugly Mama and the Zk\" (2003)\n*\"Big Green Mama Falls in Love\" (2006) in ''[[Eidolon I]]'' (ed.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516080443/http://www.citypages.com/databank/19/927/article5962.asp] Arnason has said that her experience growing up around [[avant-garde]] artists in a futurist house, in addition to the influence of her feminist, socialist mother contributed to her preoccupation with the future, and consequently science fiction. Prior to 1949, Arnason's family moved frequently: from New York City to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; London; Paris; and St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nShe graduated from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1964, with a B.A. in art history, and continued her education in graduate school at the University of Minnesota, until 1967. She spent the next seven years working as an office clerk in Brooklyn and then Detroit. Her time in these blue-collar, racially diverse areas helped to shape her understanding about class consciousness, conflict, and revolution\u2014notions that are reflected in her works. Arnason moved back to [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] in 1974 and continued to work in offices, warehouses, a large art museum, and more recently, a series of small nonprofits devoted to history, peace, justice, and art.<ref>Arnason, Eleanor. ''Mammoths of the Great Plains'' PM Press. Seattle. 2010. Print</ref>\n\nSince 1994, she has shifted her literary focus from novels to short fiction. She retired in 2009 and now writes full-time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Author Spotlight: Eleanor Arnason |author=Earnie Sotirokos |date=November 2012 |url=http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/nonfiction/author-spotlight-eleanor-arnason/ |work=Lightspeed}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\nThe issues that transpire most in Arnason's life and writings encompass feminism, peace, social justice, support for the union movement and a deep belief that racism and all forms of prejudice should be opposed. [[City Pages]] labelled Arnason as a political radical.<ref>{{cite news|title=State Writes |date=September 9, 1998 |work=[[City Pages]] |location=Minneapolis |url=http://www.citypages.com/news/state-writes-6712740 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132130/http://www.citypages.com/news/state-writes-6712740 |archivedate=2016-01-09 }}</ref>\n\nHaving come of age during [[Second-wave feminism]], Arnason included gender and sexuality as central themes in her work, notably in her collection of {{Not a typo|''hwarhath''}} stories, in which she \"wanted to create a society in which homosexual love was normal and heterosexual love was abnormal, sort of as a thought experiment. And because contemporary Americans have very rigid ideas of what is normal.\"<ref name=\"tvbookshelf.ws\"/> The {{Not a typo|''hwarhath''}} stories also addressed issues of gender roles and reproductive rights.\n\nShe was profoundly affected by the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy period]], particularly because of the ways that children were taught to [[securitization (international relations)|securitize]] against nuclear annihilation. She became involved in the Student Peace Union and attended demonstrations during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. ''Ring of Swords'', Arnason's {{Not a typo|hwarhath}} novel, illustrates peacebuilding after a long war; an endeavor both representative of Arnason's peace beliefs and of the [[make love, not war]] politics of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1963, Arnason went to the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] with her mother. This had a profound impact that would be reflected in her story \"Big Brown Mama and Brer Rabbit\" in which Brer Rabbit transforms into an African-American man in the early 20th century. Arnason has often opted for racially diverse characters, including, but not limited to, a heroine of Chinese descent in ''A Woman of the Iron People'' and a Hispanic heroine in Ring of Swords. In addition, her Lydia Duluth stories present a future in which an overwhelming majority of humans have dark brown and black toned skins as the best protection against the radiation of many stars.\n\nArnason had intermittent activist politics outside of her work as an author, working in a campaign office in New York, collecting and transporting supplies for striking coal miners in Kentucky, becoming a local and national official in the [[National Writers Union]] and engaging in [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] precinct politics.\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Standalone Novels===\n*''[[The Sword Smith]]'' (1978)\n*''To the Resurrection Station'' (1986)\n*''Daughter of the Bear King'' (1987)\n*Woman of the Iron People series\n**Part 1 ''In the Light of Sigma Draconis'' (1991)\n**Part 2 ''Changing Women'' (1991)\n**''[[A Woman of the Iron People]]'' (1991)\n\n===Standalone Short Stories===\n*\"A Clear Day in the Motor City\" (1973)\n*\"The Warlord of Saturn's Moons\" (1974)\n*\"Ace 167\" (1974)\n*\"The House by the Sea\" (1975)\n*\"The Face on the Barroom Floor\" (1976) with [[Ruth Berman]]\n*\"Going Down\" (1977)\n*\"A Ceremony of Discontent\" (1981)\n*\"The Ivory Comb\" (1982)\n*\"Glam's Story\" (1987)\n*\"Among the Featherless Bipeds\" (1988)\n*\"A Brief History of the Order of St. Cyprian the Athlete\" (1992)\n*\"The Dog's Story\" (1996)\n*\"The Venetian Method\" (1998)\n*\"Feeding the Mother: A Hwarhath Religious Anecdote\" (1998)\n*\"The Grammarian's Five Daughters\" (1999), [https://web.archive.org/web/20130421083220/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040329/grammarian.shtml available online]\n*\"Origin Story\" (2000)\n*\"Moby Quilt\" (2001)\n*\"The Lost Mother: A Story Told by the Divers\" (2002)\n*\"Knapsack Poems\" (2002)\n*\"The Potter of Bones\" (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20101013180312/http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0401/bones.shtml available online]\n*\"Big Black mama and Tentacle Man\" (2003)\n*\"Big Ugly Mama and the Zk\" (2003)\n*\"Big Green Mama Falls in Love\" (2006) in ''[[Eidolon I]]'' (ed.

Hubbard of the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]] began to rouse interest in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] for the establishment of a network of [[Arctic]] stations. His plan, in broad perspective, envisaged the establishment of two main stations, one in [[Greenland]] and the other within the Archipelago, which could be reached by sea supply. These main stations would then serve as advance bases from which a number of smaller stations would be established by air. The immediate plans contemplated the establishment of weather stations only, but it was felt that a system of weather stations would also provide a nucleus of transportation, communications and settlements, which would greatly aid programs of research in many other fields of science. It was recognized that ultimate action would depend on international co-operation, since the land masses involved were under Canadian and Danish control.\n[[File:US diplomat Laura Lochman visits Alert, Nunavut, 2010-04 -a.jpg|thumb|left|A sign at [[CFS Alert]] commemorating Alert as the northern-most permanently inhabited settlement in the world. The area has been inhabited since 1950.]]\nFollowing negotiations between the American and Canadian governments, a group of five weather stations were established, known as the Joint Arctic Weather Stations (JAWS). On the Canadian side, the stations were to be operated by the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]]. The locations for each station were surveyed in 1946, and a cache of supplies was dropped in Alert in 1948 by [[USCGC Edisto (WAGB-284)|USS ''Edisto'']]. Alert was the last of the five to be settled when the first twelve personnel (eight permanent staff and four to assist with construction) arrived on April 9, 1950.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson, Jr.|first1=J.

Alert had been the embarkation point for many North Pole expeditions that relied on weather information supplied by the weather station there. The 1971 expedition was led by [[Commissioners of the Northwest Territories|NWT Commissioner]], [[Stuart Hodgson]], and included in his party were representatives of the Prime Minister's office, the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], as well as a large media group including [[Pat Carney]] of Gemini Productions, Ed Ogle of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Val Wake of ''[[CBC News]]'' and a television crew from California. While waiting in Alert for a weather window to fly into the Pole, the party's television crew spent a lot of time filming at the weather station. The military was unhappy about the film crew working on the station, but the weather station was seen as being a sort of no-man's land. The Commissioner's party made two attempts to reach the Pole and failed. Some of the incidents surrounding this event are recounted in Val Wake's memoir ''My Voyage around Spray with Apologies to Captain Joshua Slocum''.<ref>''[http://valwaketheauthor.com/myvoyagearoundspray.php My Voyage Around Spray]'' Val Wake website</ref>\n\n===Recent history (1971\u2013present)===\n[[File:BAPMoN opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening of the [[Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory|Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network]] in 1986.]]\nIn August 1975, Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] and his then 3-year-old son and future prime minister, [[Justin Trudeau]] visited the station and nearby [[Ward Hunt Island]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Discovery recalls Justin Trudeau's 1st visit to High Arctic \u2014 as a 3-year-old|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/arctic-cairn-ward-hunt-island-trudeau-1.4055558|work=CBC News|language=en}}</ref> In August 1986, the [[Government of Canada]] opened [[Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory|Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network]] in Alert.\n\nBy the 1990s, the remaining buildings for the original weather station had fallen into a state of disrepair and were burned in the summer of 1996, leaving only the hydrogen shed and a wooden outhouse.

The crash investigation recommended all C-130s be retrofitted with [[Ground proximity warning system|ground proximity detectors]]. The [[Search and rescue|crash and rescue]] efforts were the basis of the film ''[[Ordeal in the Arctic]]'' (1993).\n\n==Institutions==\n===Canadian Forces Station Alert===\n{{main|CFS Alert}}\nSince the beginning of the JAWS project, the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] had been interested in the establishment at Alert for several reasons: the JAWS facility extended Canadian sovereignty over a large uninhabited area which Canada claimed as its sovereign territory, and furthermore, its proximity to the [[Soviet Union]] made it of strategic importance. In fact, Alert is closer to Moscow (c. {{convert|2,500|mi|abbr=on}}) than it is to [[Ottawa]] (c. {{convert|2,580|mi|abbr=on}}). Thus, the possibility of utilizing the site for the purpose of intercepting radio signals was deemed to warrant a military presence.\n\nIn 1950, [[Alert Airport]] was established. It is the only airport serving the settlement and is presently a part of CFS Alert. In 1956, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), which was expanding its presence throughout the high Arctic with the construction of the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] radar network, established a building uphill from the DOT's JAWS station to house \"High Arctic Long Range Communications Research\", or signals intelligence operations.\n\nIn 1957, Alert Wireless Station was conceived as an intercept facility to be jointly staffed by personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) and the RCAF. Five additional buildings were constructed: a mess, three barracks/accommodations buildings, and a power house and vehicle maintenance building, in addition to the existing operations building, built in 1956. The operations building housed the radio intercept and cryptographic equipment. On September 1, 1958, control of the station was transferred from the Air Force to the Army, and it officially began operations.\n\nThe following decade saw a dramatic expansion of the station, with a correspondingly greater number of personnel stationed there. The February 1, 1968, [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces|unification]] of the RCN, RCAF and [[Canadian Army]] to form the Canadian Armed Forces saw Alert Wireless Station change its name to Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert). Its personnel were no longer drawn from only the Air Force or Navy, but primarily from the Canadian Forces Communications Command.\n[[File:Bv 206 cfsalert.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Bandvagn 206]] with [[CFS Alert]] in the background, a military station operated by the [[Canadian Armed Forces]].]]\nAt its peak, CFS Alert had upwards of 215 personnel posted at any one time. The station became a key asset in the global [[ECHELON]] network of the [[Five Eyes|US-UK-CAN-AUS-NZ intelligence sharing alliance]], with Alert being privy to many secret Soviet communications regarding land-based and sea-based [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] test launches and many operational military deployments.\n\nThe first military women to serve in Alert arrived in 1980 as part of the Canadian Forces' Women In Non-Traditional Roles study.  After its completion in 1983, women were fully authorized to serve in all roles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Forces Station Alert {{!}} 8 Wing {{!}} Royal Canadian Air Force|url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/8-wing/alert.page|language=en|access-date=2015-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090025/http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/8-wing/alert.page|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The first female commanding officer was Maj.

Remaining personnel are responsible for airfield operations, construction/engineering, food service, and logistical/administrative support. Only six personnel are now responsible for actual operations, and control of the facility was passed to DND's Information Management Group following the disbanding of CF Communications Command with force restructuring and cutbacks in the mid-1990s.\n\nWith Canada's commitment to the global war on terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in New York City and Washington, D.C., CFS Alert has received renewed and increased funding to expand its [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] capabilities. On April 1, 2009, the RCAF officially took responsibility for CFS Alert from Canadian Forces Information Operations Group (CFIOG).\n\n====Civilian contractor====\nAs of April 13, 2006, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] was reporting that the heating costs for the station had risen, as a consequence of which the military proposed to cut back on support trade positions by using private contractors.<ref name=\"CbcAlert20060413\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/13/north-alert-military060413.html|title=Costly fuel prompts cuts at northern military station|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=[[CBC News]]|date=April 13, 2006|accessdate=August 9, 2008}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060414125705/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/04/13/north-alert-military060413.html article mirror]</ref> By 2008, maintenance operations on the station\u2014including food and housekeeping services, vehicle maintenance, powerplant operation, and heating, electrical, and plumbing\u2014had been transferred to a civilian contractor.

The shore is comprised\nprimarily of [[slate]] and [[shale]]. The sea is covered with [[sea ice]] for most of the year but the ice pack does move out in the summer months, leaving open water. Evaporation rates are also very low, as average monthly temperatures are above freezing only in July and August.\n\nOther places on Ellesmere Island are the weather station at [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]] ({{Convert|480|km|abbr=on}}) and the [[Inuit]] community of [[Grise Fiord]], {{Convert|800|km|abbr=on}}, to the southwest and south, respectively.

There is complete snow cover for at least 10 months of the year on average and snow from one year persists into the next year in protected areas, but enough melts to prevent glaciation. The warmest month, July, has an average temperature of {{convert|3.4|C}}, with only July and August averaging above freezing, and those are also the months where well over 90% of the rainfall occurs. Alert is also very dry, the fourth-driest locality in Nunavut, averaging only {{convert|158.3|mm|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year. Most of this occurs during the months of July, August and September, mostly in the form of snow. On average Alert sees {{convert|17.4|mm|abbr=on}} of rain, the least of any place in Nunavut, between June and September. Alert sees very little snowfall during the rest of the year. September is usually the month with the heaviest snowfall. February is the coldest month of the year with a mean temperature of {{convert|-33.2|C}}. The yearly mean, {{convert|-17.7|C}}, is the second-coldest in Nunavut after [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]]. Snowfall can occur during any month of the year, and the average frost-free growing season in an average summer averages only five days.<ref name=\"ccn\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1731&lang=e&amp;StationName=Alert&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=5&dispBack=1 | format=CSV (4222 KB) | id = Climate ID: 2400300 |title = Alert A | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = January 13, 2016|date = 2011-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBeing far north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Alert experiences [[polar night]] from October 14 to February 28, and [[midnight sun]] from April 7 to September 4.

Hubbard of the [[National Weather Service|United States Weather Bureau]] began to rouse interest in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] for the establishment of a network of [[Arctic]] stations. His plan, in broad perspective, envisaged the establishment of two main stations, one in [[Greenland]] and the other within the Archipelago, which could be reached by sea supply. These main stations would then serve as advance bases from which a number of smaller stations would be established by air. The immediate plans contemplated the establishment of weather stations only, but it was felt that a system of weather stations would also provide a nucleus of transportation, communications and settlements, which would greatly aid programs of research in many other fields of science. It was recognized that ultimate action would depend on international co-operation, since the land masses involved were under Canadian and Danish control.\n[[File:US diplomat Laura Lochman visits Alert, Nunavut, 2010-04 -a.jpg|thumb|left|A sign at [[CFS Alert]] commemorating Alert as the northern-most permanently inhabited settlement in the world. The area has been inhabited since 1950.]]\nFollowing negotiations between the American and Canadian governments, a group of five weather stations were established, known as the Joint Arctic Weather Stations (JAWS). On the Canadian side, the stations were to be operated by the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]]. The locations for each station were surveyed in 1946, and a cache of supplies was dropped in Alert in 1948 by [[USCGC Edisto (WAGB-284)|USS ''Edisto'']]. Alert was the last of the five to be settled when the first twelve personnel (eight permanent staff and four to assist with construction) arrived on April 9, 1950.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson, Jr.|first1=J.

Alert had been the embarkation point for many North Pole expeditions that relied on weather information supplied by the weather station there. The 1971 expedition was led by [[Commissioners of the Northwest Territories|NWT Commissioner]], [[Stuart Hodgson]], and included in his party were representatives of the Prime Minister's office, the Canadian Armed Forces, the federal [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], as well as a large media group including [[Pat Carney]] of Gemini Productions, Ed Ogle of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Val Wake of ''[[CBC News]]'' and a television crew from California. While waiting in Alert for a weather window to fly into the Pole, the party's television crew spent a lot of time filming at the weather station. The military was unhappy about the film crew working on the station, but the weather station was seen as being a sort of no-man's land. The Commissioner's party made two attempts to reach the Pole and failed. Some of the incidents surrounding this event are recounted in Val Wake's memoir ''My Voyage around Spray with Apologies to Captain Joshua Slocum''.<ref>''[http://valwaketheauthor.com/myvoyagearoundspray.php My Voyage Around Spray]'' Val Wake website</ref>\n\n===Recent history (1971\u2013present)===\n[[File:BAPMoN opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|The opening of the [[Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory|Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network]] in 1986.]]\nIn August 1975, Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]] and his then 3-year-old son and future prime minister, [[Justin Trudeau]] visited the station and nearby [[Ward Hunt Island]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Discovery recalls Justin Trudeau's 1st visit to High Arctic \u2014 as a 3-year-old|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/arctic-cairn-ward-hunt-island-trudeau-1.4055558|work=CBC News|language=en}}</ref> In August 1986, the [[Government of Canada]] opened [[Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory|Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network]] in Alert.\n\nBy the 1990s, the remaining buildings for the original weather station had fallen into a state of disrepair and were burned in the summer of 1996, leaving only the hydrogen shed and a wooden outhouse.

The crash investigation recommended all C-130s be retrofitted with [[Ground proximity warning system|ground proximity detectors]]. The [[Search and rescue|crash and rescue]] efforts were the basis of the film ''[[Ordeal in the Arctic]]'' (1993).\n\n==Institutions==\n===Canadian Forces Station Alert===\n{{main|CFS Alert}}\nSince the beginning of the JAWS project, the [[Canadian Armed Forces]] had been interested in the establishment at Alert for several reasons: the JAWS facility extended Canadian sovereignty over a large uninhabited area which Canada claimed as its sovereign territory, and furthermore, its proximity to the [[Soviet Union]] made it of strategic importance. In fact, Alert is closer to Moscow (c. {{convert|2,500|mi|abbr=on}}) than it is to [[Ottawa]] (c. {{convert|2,580|mi|abbr=on}}). Thus, the possibility of utilizing the site for the purpose of intercepting radio signals was deemed to warrant a military presence.\n\nIn 1950, [[Alert Airport]] was established. It is the only airport serving the settlement and is presently a part of CFS Alert. In 1956, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), which was expanding its presence throughout the high Arctic with the construction of the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] radar network, established a building uphill from the DOT's JAWS station to house \"High Arctic Long Range Communications Research\", or signals intelligence operations.\n\nIn 1957, Alert Wireless Station was conceived as an intercept facility to be jointly staffed by personnel from the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) and the RCAF. Five additional buildings were constructed: a mess, three barracks/accommodations buildings, and a power house and vehicle maintenance building, in addition to the existing operations building, built in 1956. The operations building housed the radio intercept and cryptographic equipment. On September 1, 1958, control of the station was transferred from the Air Force to the Army, and it officially began operations.\n\nThe following decade saw a dramatic expansion of the station, with a correspondingly greater number of personnel stationed there. The February 1, 1968, [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces|unification]] of the RCN, RCAF and [[Canadian Army]] to form the Canadian Armed Forces saw Alert Wireless Station change its name to Canadian Forces Station Alert (CFS Alert). Its personnel were no longer drawn from only the Air Force or Navy, but primarily from the Canadian Forces Communications Command.\n[[File:Bv 206 cfsalert.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Bandvagn 206]] with [[CFS Alert]] in the background, a military station operated by the [[Canadian Armed Forces]].]]\nAt its peak, CFS Alert had upwards of 215 personnel posted at any one time. The station became a key asset in the global [[ECHELON]] network of the [[Five Eyes|US-UK-CAN-AUS-NZ intelligence sharing alliance]], with Alert being privy to many secret Soviet communications regarding land-based and sea-based [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] test launches and many operational military deployments.\n\nThe first military women to serve in Alert arrived in 1980 as part of the Canadian Forces' Women In Non-Traditional Roles study.

Only six personnel are now responsible for actual operations, and control of the facility was passed to DND's Information Management Group following the disbanding of CF Communications Command with force restructuring and cutbacks in the mid-1990s.\n\nWith Canada's commitment to the global war on terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in New York City and Washington, D.C., CFS Alert has received renewed and increased funding to expand its [[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]] capabilities. On April 1, 2009, the RCAF officially took responsibility for CFS Alert from Canadian Forces Information Operations Group (CFIOG).\n\n====Civilian contractor====\nAs of April 13, 2006, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] was reporting that the heating costs for the station had risen, as a consequence of which the military proposed to cut back on support trade positions by using private contractors.<ref name=\"CbcAlert20060413\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/13/north-alert-military060413.html|title=Costly fuel prompts cuts at northern military station|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=[[CBC News]]|date=April 13, 2006|accessdate=August 9, 2008}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20060414125705/http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/04/13/north-alert-military060413.html article mirror]</ref> By 2008, maintenance operations on the station\u2014including food and housekeeping services, vehicle maintenance, powerplant operation, and heating, electrical, and plumbing\u2014had been transferred to a civilian contractor.  The contract was initially awarded to Canadian Base Operators (CBO), a subsidiary of Black & McDonald.  In 2012, the contract was won by Nasittuq, a subsidiary of [[ATCO]].\n\n===Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory===\n{{main|Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory}}\n[[File:Gaw lab 20160601.jpg|thumb|right|The Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory in June 2016.]]\nIn 1975, technicians employed by the weather station began collecting flask samples for a greenhouse gas monitoring program. In 1980, this grew to include the weekly collection of filter-based aerosol samples for the Canadian Arctic Aerosol Sampling Network (CAASN).<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Arctic Aerosol Chemistry Program (CAACP)|url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/natchem/default.asp?lang=en&n=573F3546-1|publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1984, the number of ongoing monitoring programs and the amount of experimental research had outgrown the abilities of the weather station to maintain, and plans were made for the construction of a permanent observatory. This observatory, located {{convert|400|m|yd}} southwest of Lancaster Hall (more commonly known as the far transmitter building), was opened August 29, 1986. Originally known as the Alert Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) Observatory, it was subsequently renamed the Dr. Neil Trivett Global Atmosphere Watch Observatory in honour of the Environment Canada researcher who provided the impetus for its construction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Whitnell|first1=Tim|title=Scientist honoured for work|url=http://www.thespec.com/news-story/2964713-scientist-honoured-for-work/|accessdate=February 8, 2018|work=The Hamilton Spectator|date=August 20, 2006|language=en-CA}}</ref> The observatory employs two technicians, who reside at CFS Alert: an operator and an assistant operator (normally a university co-op student).

This population, while initially small, grew to upwards of 250 in the 1970s and 80s, before being downsized in the 1990s when information gathering operations were relayed to CFS Leitrim near Ottawa for collation, reducing the on site  staff considerably.  Its current population ranges from a winter minimum of 65 to a summer maximum of 110, plus a variety of short-term visitors, who can swell the total to 150 or more.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Orthographic projection centred over Alert Nunavut.png|left|thumb|Orthographic projection centred over Alert, Nunavut.]]\nAlert is located {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Cape Sheridan]], the northeastern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]], on the shore of the ice-covered [[Lincoln Sea]]. Alert lies just {{convert|817|km|abbr=on}} from the [[North Pole]]; the nearest Canadian city is [[Iqaluit]], the capital of the territory of Nunavut, {{convert|2092|km|abbr=on}} away.\n\nThe settlement is surrounded by rugged hills and valleys. The shore is comprised\nprimarily of [[slate]] and [[shale]]. The sea is covered with [[sea ice]] for most of the year but the ice pack does move out in the summer months, leaving open water. Evaporation rates are also very low, as average monthly temperatures are above freezing only in July and August.\n\nOther places on Ellesmere Island are the weather station at [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]] ({{Convert|480|km|abbr=on}}) and the [[Inuit]] community of [[Grise Fiord]], {{Convert|800|km|abbr=on}}, to the southwest and south, respectively. [[Siorapaluk]] ({{Convert|540|km|abbr=on}} to the south) is the nearest populated place in Greenland.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Une partie de l'h\u00e9misph\u00e8re nord de la Terre avec la banquise, nuage, \u00e9toile et localisation de la station m\u00e9t\u00e9o en Alert.jpg|thumb|275px|Alert (indicated by small text label near centre of image) within the Arctic region.

There is complete snow cover for at least 10 months of the year on average and snow from one year persists into the next year in protected areas, but enough melts to prevent glaciation. The warmest month, July, has an average temperature of {{convert|3.4|C}}, with only July and August averaging above freezing, and those are also the months where well over 90% of the rainfall occurs. Alert is also very dry, the fourth-driest locality in Nunavut, averaging only {{convert|158.3|mm|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year. Most of this occurs during the months of July, August and September, mostly in the form of snow. On average Alert sees {{convert|17.4|mm|abbr=on}} of rain, the least of any place in Nunavut, between June and September. Alert sees very little snowfall during the rest of the year. September is usually the month with the heaviest snowfall. February is the coldest month of the year with a mean temperature of {{convert|-33.2|C}}. The yearly mean, {{convert|-17.7|C}}, is the second-coldest in Nunavut after [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]]. Snowfall can occur during any month of the year, and the average frost-free growing season in an average summer averages only five days.<ref name=\"ccn\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=1731&lang=e&amp;StationName=Alert&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&dCode=5&dispBack=1 | format=CSV (4222 KB) | id = Climate ID: 2400300 |title = Alert A | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 | accessdate = January 13, 2016|date = 2011-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBeing far north of the [[Arctic Circle]], Alert experiences [[polar night]] from October 14 to February 28, and [[midnight sun]] from April 7 to September 4.

Situated on the southwestern coast of [[Banks Island]] in the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]], the population according to the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]] count was 103 people.

Sachs Harbour is the only permanent settlement on Banks Island.\n\nThe town was named after the ship ''Mary Sachs'', which was part of the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916|Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913]].\n\n==Community life==\n[[File:Sachs Harbour plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque]]\nThe community's [[Economic system|economy]] is based largely on [[hunting]] and [[trapping]], but [[tourism]] also plays a small role. Most of the town lies within {{convert|250|yd|abbr=on}} of the shoreline. Residents also engage in [[ice fishing]], harvesting fish from the [[Amundsen Gulf]] and the [[Beaufort Sea]]. There is a [[goose]] hunt every spring - Banks Island being the home to the largest goose colony in North America. The community is also home to the largest commercial [[muskox]] harvests in Canada. Three quarters of the world's population of muskoxen roam the island. [[Barren-ground caribou]] and [[polar bear]] are also seen on the island. On April 26, 2006, the world's first documented wild-born [[grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrid]] was shot near the town.\n\n==Aulavik National Park==\nSachs Harbour is the headquarters of [[Aulavik National Park]] and the Visitor Reception Centre is situated in Sachs Harbour. Aulavik National Park is located on the north end of Banks Island, and is co-operatively managed by [[Parks Canada]] with the residents of Sachs Harbour and the broader [[Inuvialuit]] community. The Visitor Reception Centre presents the park and Inuvialuit culture to visitors to Banks Island, as well as serves as a centre for community activities.\nOn the north shore of Banks Island within Aulavik National Park is a narrow bay, [[Mercy Bay]], penetrating some distance into the park. It is of historical significance for one of a number of ships sent out to the [[Arctic]] by the [[Admiralty]] to find the lost expedition of [[John Franklin]], became trapped in the ice in the bay for some three years and had to be abandoned by its crew. That ship was the [[HMS Investigator (1848)|''Investigator'']] and its captain, Commander [[Robert McClure]]. The ''Investigator'' sailed from England all around North and South America so that it passed through the [[Bering Strait]] in an attempt to find the [[Northwest Passage]] from the west while looking for [[Franklin's lost expedition]].\n\n==Exploration==\n[[Petroleum|Oil]] and gas exploration has provided jobs over the years for some Sachs Harbour residents\u2014estimates of commercially recoverable oil in the Beaufort Sea range from {{convert|4|to|12|Goilbbl|m3}}, and there is believed to be between {{convert|13|and|63|Tcuft|km3}} of [[natural gas]].\n\n==Services==\nServices include a two-member [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] detachment and a [[Community health center|health centre]] with one [[Nursing|nurse]].<ref name=\"infra\">[http://www.statsnwt.ca/community-data/Infrastructure%20PDF/Sachs%20Harbour_In.pdf Infrastructure]</ref> Phone services are provided by [[Northwestel]] with Internet access.

Since the activities of many residents of the community revolve around fishing, hunting, and travel, many residents have considerable knowledge of weather conditions, [[permafrost]], and even [[erosion]] patterns. Because of [[climate change]]s in recent years, local residents fear their knowledge of weather patterns may not be of much use, as the weather has become harder to predict. Since the climate has been changing, [[sea ice]] has been breaking up earlier than normal, taking seals farther south in the summer. Seals are one of the main sources of food for the town. [[Sockeye salmon|Sockeye]] and [[pink salmon]] appeared for the first time in nearby waters between 1999 and 2001.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic53-2-161.pdf First Records of Sockeye

including [[American robin|robin]]s and [[barn swallow]]s, and more flies and [[mosquito]]s have been

Sachs Harbour is the only permanent settlement on Banks Island.\n\nThe town was named after the ship ''Mary Sachs'', which was part of the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916|Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913]].\n\n==Community life==\n[[File:Sachs Harbour plaque.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque]]\nThe community's [[Economic system|economy]] is based largely on [[hunting]] and [[trapping]], but [[tourism]] also plays a small role. Most of the town lies within {{convert|250|yd|abbr=on}} of the shoreline. Residents also engage in [[ice fishing]], harvesting fish from the [[Amundsen Gulf]] and the [[Beaufort Sea]]. There is a [[goose]] hunt every spring - Banks Island being the home to the largest goose colony in North America. The community is also home to the largest commercial [[muskox]] harvests in Canada. Three quarters of the world's population of muskoxen roam the island. [[Barren-ground caribou]] and [[polar bear]] are also seen on the island. On April 26, 2006, the world's first documented wild-born [[grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrid]] was shot near the town.\n\n==Aulavik National Park==\nSachs Harbour is the headquarters of [[Aulavik National Park]] and the Visitor Reception Centre is situated in Sachs Harbour. Aulavik National Park is located on the north end of Banks Island, and is co-operatively managed by [[Parks Canada]] with the residents of Sachs Harbour and the broader [[Inuvialuit]] community. The Visitor Reception Centre presents the park and Inuvialuit culture to visitors to Banks Island, as well as serves as a centre for community activities.\nOn the north shore of Banks Island within Aulavik National Park is a narrow bay, [[Mercy Bay]], penetrating some distance into the park. It is of historical significance for one of a number of ships sent out to the [[Arctic]] by the [[Admiralty]] to find the lost expedition of [[John Franklin]], became trapped in the ice in the bay for some three years and had to be abandoned by its crew. That ship was the [[HMS Investigator (1848)|''Investigator'']] and its captain, Commander [[Robert McClure]]. The ''Investigator'' sailed from England all around North and South America so that it passed through the [[Bering Strait]] in an attempt to find the [[Northwest Passage]] from the west while looking for [[Franklin's lost expedition]].\n\n==Exploration==\n[[Petroleum|Oil]] and gas exploration has provided jobs over the years for some Sachs Harbour residents\u2014estimates of commercially recoverable oil in the Beaufort Sea range from {{convert|4|to|12|Goilbbl|m3}}, and there is believed to be between {{convert|13|and|63|Tcuft|km3}} of [[natural gas]].\n\n==Services==\nServices include a two-member [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] detachment and a [[Community health center|health centre]] with one [[Nursing|nurse]].<ref name=\"infra\">[http://www.statsnwt.ca/community-data/Infrastructure%20PDF/Sachs%20Harbour_In.pdf Infrastructure]</ref> Phone services are provided by [[Northwestel]] with Internet access. The local hunters and trappers association provides outfitting for big-game hunts like muskox and polar bears.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=none|cols=2\n|1996|140\n|1997|150\n|1998|149\n|1999|138\n|2000|127\n|2001|125\n|2002|118\n|2003|113\n|2004|121\n|2005|122\n|2006|127\n|2007|123\n|2008|124\n|2009|131\n|2010|126\n|2011|115\n|2012|117\n|2013|124\n|2014|125\n|2015|116\n|2016|115\n|2017|112\n|footnote= Sources: NWT Bureau of Statistics (2001 - 2017)<ref name=brost>[https://www.statsnwt.ca/population/population-estimates/commtotals_2001-2017.xlsx Population Estimates By Community] from the GNWT</ref>\n}}\n\nIn 2017 the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 112 with an average yearly growth rate of -0.9 from 2007.<ref name=\"comstat\"/>\n==Gallery==\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Sachs Harbour.JPG\n |alt1=\n |Located on the southern shores of Banks Island\n|File:Atmospheric Environment Services site.JPG\n |alt2=\n |This site was closed and abandoned years ago\n|File:NWT's most northely community.JPG\n |alt3=\n |Sachs Harbour's population has been declining and now has approximately 90 residents\n}}\n\n==Climate==\nSachs Harbour is in the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] [[Climate|climatic]] zone, characterized by long, cold winters. Since the activities of many residents of the community revolve around fishing, hunting, and travel, many residents have considerable knowledge of weather conditions, [[permafrost]], and even [[erosion]] patterns. Because of [[climate change]]s in recent years, local residents fear their knowledge of weather patterns may not be of much use, as the weather has become harder to predict. Since the climate has been changing, [[sea ice]] has been breaking up earlier than normal, taking seals farther south in the summer. Seals are one of the main sources of food for the town. [[Sockeye salmon|Sockeye]] and [[pink salmon]] appeared for the first time in nearby waters between 1999 and 2001.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic53-2-161.pdf First Records of Sockeye

[[Vedanta]] literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]].'' ''VishishtAdvaita'' (literally \"[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] with uniqueness; qualifications\") is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta philosophy. It is [[non-dualism]] of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as qualified monism or qualified non-dualism or attributive [[monism]]. It is a school of Vedanta philosophy which believes in all diversity subsuming to an underlying unity.\n\n[[Ramanuja]], the 11-12th century philosopher and the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the [[Prasthanatrayi]] (\"The three courses\"), namely the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Brahmasutra|Brahma Sutras]] are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency. [[Vedanta Desika]] defines ''Vishishtadvaita'' using the statement, ''Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam :'' [[Brahman]], as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality.{{Hindu philosophy}}\n\n==Philosophers==\nThe Vishishtadvaitic thought is considered to have existed for a long time, and it is surmised that the earliest works are no longer available.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=945}}</ref>  The names of the earliest of these philosophers is only known through [[Ramanuja]]'s ''Vedartha Sangraham''. Bodhayana, Dramida, Tanka, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bharuci the prominent ones in the line of the philosophers considered to have expounded the Visishtadvaitic system.\n\n[[Bodhayana]] is considered to have written an extensive ''vritti'' (commentary) on the [[Purva Mimamsa|Purva]] and [[Uttara Mimamsa]]s. Tanka is attributed with having written commentaries on [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and Brahma Sutras.  [[Nathamuni]] of the ninth century AD, the foremost [[Acharya]] of the [[Vaishnava]]s, collected the Tamil [[Divya Prabandha|prabandhas]], classified them, made the redaction, set the hymns to music and spread them everywhere.  He is said to have received the divine hymns straight from [[Nammalvar]], the foremost of the twelve [[Alvars]], by yogic insight in the temple at Alwar Thirunagari, which is located near [[Tirunelveli]] in South [[India]]. [[Yamunacharya]] renounced kingship and spent his last days in the service of the Lord at [[Srirangam]] and in laying the fundamentals of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy by writing four basic works on the subject.\n\nRamanuja is the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. The philosophy itself is considered to have existed long before Ramanuja's time.<ref name=\"EoH 490\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=490}}</ref>  Ramanuja continues along the line of thought of his predecessors while expounding the knowledge expressed in the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita. [[Vedanta Desika]] and [[Pillai Lokacharya]], disciples in the tradition of Ramanuja, had minor disagreements not on the [[philosophy]], but on some aspects of the [[theology]], giving rise to the [[Vadakalai]] and [[Thenkalai]] schools of thought, as explained below.\n\n[[Swaminarayan]], the founder of [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]], also propagated this philosophy and based the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] (original name is [[Uddhava]] Sampraday) on these ideals.<ref name=\"Williams Swaminarayan Vishishtadvait\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 65279 0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will/page/35 35]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will/page/35}}</ref>\n\n== Key principles ==\nThere are three key principles of Vishishtadvaita:{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* ''[[Tattva]]'': The knowledge of the 3 real entities namely, ''[[jiva]]'' (living souls; the sentient); ''[[ajiva]]'' (the nonsentient) and [[Ishvara]] (''Vishnu-Narayana'' or ''Parahbrahman'', Supreme-self and the cause of all manifestations and in-dwelling giver of grace based on Karma).\n* ''[[Hit\u0101|Hita]]'': The means of realization, as through ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) and ''[[prapatti]]'' (self-surrender).\n* ''[[Purushartha]]'': The goal to be attained, as ''moksha'' or liberation from bondage.\n\n==Epistemology==\n\n=== Pramanas ===\n''[[Pramana]]'' refers to the correct knowledge, arrived at by thorough reasoning, of any object. ''Pramana'' (\"sources of knowledge\", Sanskrit) forms one part of a ''triputi'' (trio).\n# ''Pramatir'', the ''subject''; the ''knower'' of the knowledge\n# ''Pramana'', the ''cause'' or the ''means'' of the knowledge\n# ''Prameya'', the ''object'' of knowledge\n\nIn Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, only the following three ''pramanas'' are accepted as valid means of knowledge:\n* ''Pratyaksa'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''perception''. Perception refers to knowledge obtained by cognition of external objects based on sensory perception.  In modern-day usage this will also include knowledge obtained by means of observation through scientific instruments since they are an extension of perception.\n* ''Anumana'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''inference''. Inference refers to knowledge obtained by deductive reasoning and analysis.\n* ''[[Shabda]]'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''[[shruti]]''. ''Shruti'' refers to knowledge gained from scriptures - primarily the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n====Rules of epistemology====\nThere are three rules of hierarchy when there is apparent conflict between the three modes of acquiring knowledge:\n* ''Shabda'' or ''Shruti'', Pramana occupies the highest position in matters which cannot be settled or resolved by ''pratyaksa'' (perception) or by ''anumana'' (inference).\n* ''Anumana'' occupies the next position. When an issue cannot be settled through sensory perception alone, it is settled based on inference, that is, whichever is the more logical argument.\n* When ''pratyaksa'' yields a definitive position on a particular issue, such a perception cannot be ignored by interpreting ''Shabda'' in a way which violates that perception.\n\n==Metaphysics==\n\n===Ontology===\n\nThe [[ontology]] in Vishishtadvaita consists of explaining the relationship between [[Ishvara]] (''Parabrahman''), the sentient beings (''chit-brahman'') and the insentient Universe (''achit-brahman''). In the broadest sense, Ishvara is the Universal Soul of the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings. The three ontological entities are described below:\n\n====Ishvara====\n\n[[Ishvara]] (denoted by Vishnu-Narayana) is the Supreme Cosmic Spirit who maintains complete control over the Universe and all the sentient beings, which together also form the pan-organistic body of Ishvara. The triad of Ishvara along with the universe and the sentient beings is Brahman, which signifies the completeness of existence. Ishvara is Parabrahman endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities (Kalyana Gunas). Ishvara is perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, the creator of the universe, its active ruler and also its eventual destroyer.<ref>White Yajurveda 32.3</ref> He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable \u2014 and is yet the material and the efficient cause of the universe and sentient beings. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one's Karma. He rules the world with His Maya \u2014 His divine power.\n\nIshvara is considered to have a 2-fold characteristic: he is the indweller of all beings and all beings dwell in Ishvara.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=====Antarvyapi=====\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the indweller of all beings, he is referred to as the [[Paramatman]], or the innermost self of all beings.\n\n''He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within \u2014 He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.''\n\n''He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within \u2014 He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal'' - [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.7.4-14\n\n=====Bahuvyapi=====\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the all encomposing and the residence of all beings that is, all beings reside in Ishvara, he is referred to as the paramapurusha. The sentient beings and the insentient universe which form part of the pan-organistic body of Ishvara are encapsulated by Ishvara.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}\n\n''Sarvam khalvidam Brahma'' [[Chandogya Upanishad]]\n\n''Isavasyam idam sarvam'' [[Isha Upanishad]]\n\n====Chit====\n\n[[Satchitananda|Chit]] is the world of sentient beings, or of entities possessing consciousness. It is similar to the [[Purusha]] of Samkhya system. The sentient beings are called J\u012bv\u0101s and they are possessors of individual consciousness as denoted by \"I\". The scope of Chit refers to all beings with an \"I\" consciousness, or more specifically self-awareness. Therefore, all entities which are aware of their own individual existence are denoted as ''chit''. This is called ''Dharmi-jnana'' or ''substantive consciousness''. The sentient beings also possess varying levels of ''Dharma-bhuta-jnana'' or ''attributive consciousness''\n\nThe jivas possess three different types of existence:\n* ''Nityas'', or the eternally free Jivas who were never in [[Samsara]]\n* ''Muktas'', or the Jivas that were once in Samsara but are free\n* ''Baddhas'', or the Jivas which are still in Samsara\n\n====Achit====\n[[Achit (metaphysics)|Achit]] is the world of insentient entities as denoted by matter or more specifically the non-conscious Universe. It is similar to the [[Prakriti]] of Samkhya system.\n\n====Brahman====\nThere is a subtle difference between Ishvara and Brahman. Ishvara is the substantive part of Brahman, while jivas and jagat are its modes (also secondary attributes), and kalyanagunas (auspicious attributes) are the primary attributes. The secondary attributes become manifested in the effect state when the world is differentiated by name and form. The kalyanagunas are eternally manifest.\n\n''Brahman is the description of Ishvara when comprehended in fullness\u2013 i.e., a simultaneous vision of Ishvara with all his modes and attributes. ''\n\nThe relationship between Brahman and Jivas, Jagat is expressed by R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 in numerous ways. He calls this relationship as one of:\n* '''sharIra/sharIrI (\u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930/ \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0940)'''        (''body/indweller'');\n* '''prakAra/prakArI'''      (''attribute or mode/substance'');\n* '''\u200cshesha/sheshi'''          (''Owned/owner'');\n* '''amsha/amshI'''            (''part/whole'');\n* '''AdhAradeya/sambandha''' (''supporter/supported'');\n* '''niyamya/niyanta'''      (''controlled/controller'');\n* '''rashksya/rakshaka'''      (''redeemed/redeemer'');\n\nThese relationships can be experienced holding Brahman as the father, son, mother, sister, wife, husband, friend, lover and lord. Hence, Brahman is a personal being.\n* What does Nirguna Brahman mean?\n\nRamanuja argues vehemently against understanding Brahman as one without attributes. Brahman is Nirguna in the sense that impure qualities do not touch it. He provides three valid reasons for staking such a claim:\n\nShruti/Shabda Pramana: All shrutis and shabdas denoting Brahman always list either attributes inherent to Brahman or not inherent to Brahman. The shrutis only seek to deny Brahman from possessing impure and defective qualities which affect the world of beings. There is evidence in the shrutis to this regard. The shrutis proclaim Brahman to be beyond the tri-gunas which are observed. However, Brahman possesses an infinite number of transcendental attributes, the evidence of which is given in vakhyas like \"satyam jnanam anantam Brahma\" ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]]).\n\nPratyaksha Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"a contentless cognition is impossible\". And all cognition must necessarily involve knowing Brahman through the attributes of Brahman.\n\nAnumana Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"Nirgunatva\" itself becomes an attribute of Brahman on account of the uniqueness of no other entity being Nirguna.\nRamanuja had simplified relationship between bramha and soul.According to him though soul is integral part of bramha it has independent existence.<ref>J.L.Mehta VOl3</ref>\n\n===Theory of Existence===\nThe three ontological entities i.e. Ishvara, Chit and Achit are fundamentally real. It upholds the doctrine of ''[[Satkaryavada]]'' as against ''[[Asatkaryavada]]''.\n\nBriefly,\n* Satkaryavada is pre-existence of the effect in the cause. It maintains that karya (effect) is sat or real.  It is present in the karana (cause) in a potential form, even before its manifestation.\n* Asatkaryavada is non-existence of the effect in the cause.  It maintains that karya (effect) is asat or unreal until it comes into being.  Every effect, then, is a new beginning and is not born out of cause.\n\nMore specifically, the effect is a modification of what exists in the cause and does not involve new entities coming into existence.  This is called as ''parinamavada'' or evolution of effect from the cause.  This doctrine is common to the Samkhya system and Vishishtadvaita system.  The Samkhya system adheres to Prakriti-Parinama vada whereas Vishishtadvaita is a modified form of Brahma-Parinama vada.\n\n==== {{IAST|K\u0101rya and k\u0101rana}} ====\n\nThe {{IAST|k\u0101rana}} (''cause'') and {{IAST|k\u0101rya}} (''effect'') in Vishishtadvaita is different from other systems of [[Indian philosophy]]. Brahman is both the {{IAST|k\u0101rana}} (''cause'') and the {{IAST|k\u0101rya}} (''effect'').  Brahman as the cause '''does not''' become the Universe as the effect.\n\nBrahman is assigned two {{IAST|k\u0101ranatvas}} (''ways of being the cause''):\n\n# {{IAST|Nimitta k\u0101ranatva}} \u2014 ''Being the Efficient/ Instrumental cause''. For example, a goldsmith is assigned {{IAST|Nimitta k\u0101ranatva}} as he acts as the maker of jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''Instrumental cause''.\n# {{IAST|Up\u0101d\u0101na k\u0101ranatva}} \u2014 ''Being the material cause''. For example, the gold is assigned {{IAST|Up\u0101d\u0101na k\u0101ranatva}} as it acts as the material of the jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''material cause''.\n\nAccording to Vishishtadvaita, the Universe and Sentients always exist. However, they begin from a subtle state and undergo transformation. The subtle state is called a causal state, while the transformed state is called the effect state. The causal state is when Brahman is internally not distinguishable by name and form.\n\nIt can be said that Vishishtadvaita follows '''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Brahma-Prakara-Parinama Vada]]'''. That is to say, it is the modes (Jivas and Jagath) of Brahman which is under evolution. The cause and effect only refer to the pan-organistic body transformation. Brahman as the Universal Self is unchanging and eternal.\n\nBrahman having the subtle (s\u016bkshma) chit and achit entities as his ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' before manifestation is the same Brahman having the expanded (st\u016bla) chit and achit entities as ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' after manifestation.\n\nThe essential feature is that the underlying entity is the same, the changes are in the description of that entity.\n\nFor e.g. ''Jack was a baby. Jack was a small kid. Jack was a middle-aged person. Jack was an old man. Jack is dead''\n\nThe body of a single personality named Jack is described as continuously changing. Jack does not become \"James\" because of the change.\n\n==Ethics==\n\nSouls and Matter are only the body of God. Creation is a real act of God. It is the expansion of intelligence. Matter is fundamentally real and undergoes real revelation. The Soul is a higher mode than Matter, because it is conscious. It is also eternally real and eternally distinct. Final release, that comes, by the Lord's [[divine grace|Grace]], after the death of the body is a Communion with God. This philosophy believes in liberation through one's [[Karma]]s (actions) in accordance with the Vedas, the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]] ([[caste]] or class) system and the four [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashramas]] (stages of life), along with intense devotion to Vishnu. Individual Souls retain their separate identities even after moksha. They live in Fellowship with God either serving Him or meditating on Him. The philosophy of this school is SriVaishnavism, a branch of [[Vaishnavism]].\n\n==Interpretation of Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas==\n1. sarvam khalv idam brahma''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 3.14.1\n\nTranslated literally, this means ''All this is Brahman''. The ontology of Vishishtadvaita system consists of:\n\na. Ishvara is ''Para-brahman'' with infinite superlative qualities, whose substantive nature imparts the existence to the modes\n\nb. Jivas are ''chit-brahman'' or sentient beings (which possess consciousness). They are the modes of Brahman which show consciousness.\n\nc. Jagat is ''achit-brahman'' or matter/Universe (which are non-conscious). They are the mode of Brahman which are not conscious.\n\nBrahman is the composite whole of the triad consisting of Ishvara along with his modes i.e. Jivas and Jagat.\n\n2. ayam \u0101tm\u0101 brahma''' from [[Mandukya Upanishad]] 1.2\n\nTranslated literally, this means the ''Self is Brahman''.\nFrom the earlier statement, it follows that on account of everything being Brahman, the self is not different from Brahman.\n\n3. Tat tvam asi''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 6.8.7\n\nTranslated literally, it means ''Thou art that''\n\n''that'' here refers to ''Brahman'' and ''thou'' refers to ''jiva''\n\nR\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as ''sam\u0101n\u0101dhikaranya''. Thus R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (''Parabrahman'') who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also  simultaneously the innermost self (Atm\u0101n) for each individual sentient being (J\u012bv\u0101). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprthak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.\n\nTat Tvam Asi declares that oneness of Isvara.\n\nWhen multiple entities point to a single object, the relationship is established as one of substance and its attributes.\n\nFor e.g. in a statement:\n\n''Jack is a tall and intelligent boy''\n\nThe descriptors ''tall-ness'',''intelligence'' and ''boy-ness'' all refer to a common underlying ''Jack''\n\nSimilarly, when the upanishads declare Brahman is the Universe, Purusha, Self, Prana, Vayu, and so on, the entities are attributes or modes of Brahman.\n\nIf the statement '''tat tvam asi''' is taken to mean as only ''the self is brahman'', then '''sarvam khalv idam brahma''' will not make sense.\n\n===Understanding Neti-Neti===\n{{Original research|date=April 2008}}\nThis is an upanishadic concept which is employed while attempting to know Brahman. The purport of this exercise is understood in many different ways and also influences the understanding of Brahman.\nIn the overall sense, this phrase is accepted to refer to the indescribable nature of Brahman who is beyond all rationalisations.\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad 2-9-1 passage \"yato vacho nivartanthe..\"  (words recoil, mind can not grasp...) etc., state the same concept regarding Brahman .  The visishtadvaita interpretation is that these passages do not indicate  a black hole, but the incompleteness of any statement or thought or concept concerning Brahman.  Brahman is these and more. This interpretation is consistent with \"sarvam kalvidam brahma\".  Antaryami Brahmanam of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad passage \"yasya prithvi sariram yasya atma sariram\"  is also interpreted to show that Brahman is not a zero point - \"nirvisesha chinmatra\" (an entity which has nothing except existence)\n\nThe typical interpretation of Neti-Neti is ''not this, not this'' or ''neither this, nor that''. It is a phrase meant to convey the inexpressibility of Brahman in words and the futility of trying to approximate Brahman with conceptual models.In VisishtAdvaita, the phrase is taken in the sense of ''not just this, not just this'' or ''not just this, not just that''. This means that Brahman cannot be restricted to one specific or a few specific descriptions. Consequently, Brahman is understood to possess infinite qualities and each of these qualities are infinite in extent.\n\n==Purpose of human existence==\nThe purpose or goal of human existence is called [[purushartha]]. According to the Vedas, there are four goals namely [[artha]] (wealth), [[kama]] (pleasure), [[dharma]] (righteousness) and [[moksha]] (permanent freedom from worldly bondage). According to this philosophy, the first three goals are not an end by themselves but need to be pursued with the ideal of attaining moksha.\n\n===Moksha===\nMoksha means liberation or release from [[samsara]], the cycle of rebirth.\n\n===Bhakti as the means of attaining  moksha===\n[[Bhakti]] is the sole means of liberation in Vishishtadvaita. Through [[Bhakti]] (devotion), a [[Jiva]] ascends to [[Vaikuntha]], where it continues to delight in His service in a body which is [[Satcitananda|''sat-cit-ananda'']]. Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are sub processes of Bhakti, total surrender, as the devotee acquires the knowledge that the Lord is the inner self. A devotee realizes his own state as dependent on, and supported by, and being led by the Lord, who is the Master. One is to lead a life as an instrument of the Lord, offering all his [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word, and deed]] to the feet of the Lord. One is to see the Lord in everything and everything in Him. This is the unity in diversity achieved through devotion.<ref>http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9014610686337442954</ref>\nHowever Sri [[Ramanuja]] accepts Saranagati, total surrender at the Lord's lotus feet alone as the sole means to moksha. Wherein, moksha is defined as liberation from samsara and going to Vaikuntha to serve [[Narayana]] ([[Venkateswara|Balaji]])in a spiritual body. This is a distinguishing feature of this school of philosophy, as both Adishankara's advaita and [[Madhvacharya|Anandatirtha's]] dvaita accept bhakthi for two different concepts of moksha. Swami Ramanuja has supported this opinion with various citations directly from the vedas, and various incidents highlighting sharangathi as means to attain personal stay in the realm of Vaikuntha. Observing total surrender at the Lord's feet guarantees moksha at the end of this birth, and in the time between sharanagathi and death, the surrendered soul must spend his time performing the nice forms of devotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/7/5/23-24/|title=9 forms of bhakti|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> So bhakthi is not a moksha sadhana, but for [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]] and reaching Vaikuntha, in the Vishishtadvaita Sampradaya\n\n== Thenkalai and Vadakalai schools of thought ==\nThe [[Vadakalai]]  sect of Sri Vaishnavism associate themselves with [[Vedanta Desikan]] and Ramanujacharya. Vedanta Desikan is one of the foremost learned scholars and philosophers of medieval India, who has written more than a hundred works in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Prakrit]] and [[Manipravalam|Manipravala]].  He is said to have been born as an incarnation of the divine bell of Lord [[Venkateswara|Venkateshwara]] of [[Tirupati]] and also of [[Ramanuja]]charya in the month of [[Purattasi]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1268 CE. All of his works are characterized by his versatility, irrefutable reasoning, logic, examination, deep spiritual insight, ethical fervour and excellent expressions of devotional emotion in delightful style. His [[Paduka-sahasram]] and ''Rahasyatrayasaram'' are some classic examples.  He was a great teacher, logician, expositor, debater, poet, philosopher, thinker and defender of the faith of Vaishnavism. \"''Kavitaarkika Simham\"'' (lion among poets and debaters), ''\"Sarvatantra Svatantrar\"'' (all-knowing and all-powerful), ''\"Vedaantaachaarya\"'' (the master and preceptor of the Vedanta) are some of the titles attributed to him.\n\n[[Pillai Lokacharya]] literally meaning \"Teacher for the whole world\" is one of the leading lights on the Sri Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy. His work Sri Vachana Bhusanam is a classic and provides the essence of Upanishads. The [[Tenkalai]] sect of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] looks up to him apart from Swami Ramanuja and Swami Manavala Mamuni. He was a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika. He is said to have been born as an ''amsa'' (\"essence\") of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal to document and immortalize Ramanuja's message in the month of [[Tamil months#Months|Aippaci]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1205 CE.<ref name=\"PQM 946\">{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=946}}</ref>  He is said to have lived for 106 years, during which time, he also helped to safeguard the idol of [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Ranganatha]] at [[Srirangam]] from [[Muslim]] invaders.<ref name=\"PQM 946\" />  Pillai Lokacharya confirmed the basics of the Sri Vaishnava system in his 18 monumental works popularly known as ''Ashtadasa Rahasyangal'' (\"the eighteen secrets\") also called the [[Rahasya granthas]] (\"doctrines that explain the inner meanings\") out of which Sri Vachana Bhushanam and Mumukshuppadi are the most famous. [[Manavala Mamuni]] expanded on and popularized Lokacharya's teachings arguments in Tamil.\n\n==Traditions following Vishishtadvaita==\n* [[Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya]] of south India.\n* [[Ramanandi Sampradaya|Sri Ramanandi Sect]] of Northern India, it has the largest monastic order in whole India.\n* [[Sri Swaminarayan Sampraday]] of Gujarat.\n* D\u0101modariya Vai\u015b\u0146ava sampraday of Assam.\n\n=== Visishtadvaita and Sri Vaishnavism ===\n\nThe Absolute Supreme Reality referred to as Brahman, is a Transcendent Personality. He is Narayana, also known as Lord Vishnu.\n\n''A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is the supreme position of Vishnu.'' - 1.3.9 [[Katha Upanishad]]\n\n''Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal.''- 1.3.10,11 [[Katha Upanishad]]\n\nIn terms of theology, Ramanujacharya puts forth the view that both the Supreme Goddess Lakshmi and Supreme God Narayana together constitute Brahman - the Absolute. Sri Lakshmi is the female personification of Brahman and Narayana is the male personification of Brahman, but they are both inseparable, co-eternal, co-absolute and are always substantially one. Thus, in reference to these dual aspects of Brahman, the Supreme is referred to in the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya as Sriman Narayana.\n\nThe most striking difference between Srivaishnavas and other Vaishnava groups lies in their interpretation of Vedas. While other Vaishnava groups interpret Vedic deities like Indra, Savitar, Bhaga, Rudra, etc. to be same as their Puranic counterparts, Srivaishnavas consider these to be different names/roles/forms of Lord Narayan citing solid reasons thus claiming that the entire Veda is dedicated for Vishnu worship alone. Srivaishnavas have remodelled Pancharatra homas like Sudarshana homa, etc. to include Vedic Suktas like Rudram in them, thus giving them a Vedic outlook.\n\n==Summary==\nNarayana is the Absolute God. The Soul and the Universe are only parts of this Absolute and hence, Vishishtadvaita is the solution to [[panentheistic]] and [[pantheistic]] ideologies. The relationship of God to the Soul and the Universe is like the relationship of the Soul of Man to the body of Man. Individual souls are only parts of Brahman. God, Soul and Universe together form an inseparable unity which is one and has no second.  This is the non-duality part. Matter and Souls inhere in that Ultimate Reality as attributes to a substance [needs to improvisation]. This is the qualification part of the non-duality.\n\nAccording to the Vishishtadvaita school, Brahman (the supreme being or ultimate reality) and the individual souls are different with a potential to unite. The Universe can be thought of as the ocean which is primarily composed of water (the Supreme being). But it also contains fishes and other organisms (the individual souls) living in it. The individual souls can unite with the supreme being based upon their actions and deeds. In our example, the individual souls, that is the fishes dissolve into the water, that is merge with the Supreme being once they die and are absorbed by the ocean (the Universe). Of course, as in other Hindu schools of thought, the individual souls will continue this cycle of birth, death and re-birth until they attain moksha or liberation. There are different paths to liberation based upon the school. In Vishishtadvaita, moksha or liberation can be attained by ''loving'' god. In  Adi vaita Vendaanta, the path to liberation is by gaining ''Vidya'' or knawl etge.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Turiya]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/a-history-of-indian-philosophy-volume-3/d/doc209953.html ''{{IAST|Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita}}'' doctrine of Soul according to ''{{IAST|R\u0101m\u0101nuja}}'' and ''{{IAST|Ve\u1e45ka\u1e6dan\u0101tha}}''], Surendranath Dasgupta, 1940\n* Biographies of [http://www.bharatadesam.com/people/ramanujacharya.php Ramanuja] and [http://www.bharatadesam.com/people/vedanta_deshikar.php Vedanta Desika]\n* [http://www.srivaishnavan.com Ramanuja and VisishtAdvaita]\n* [http://sriranganatha.tripod.com more information]\n* [http://shankaracharya.org Advaita and VisishtAdvaita]\n* [http://www.dlshq.org/download/hinduismbk.htm#_VPID_96 more information]\n* http://www.vaishnava.com/shrivaishnavaintro.htm\n* http://www.hinduweb.org/home/dharma_and_philosophy/vvh/vvh.htm\n* http://www.hinduweb.org/home/dharma_and_philosophy/vvh/raghavan.html\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ramanuja.org/intro.html Introduction to Sri Vaishnava Philosophy]\n* [http://www.srivaishnavam.com/index.html srivaishnavam.com-Good website on general info]\n* [http://www.anudinam.org www.anudinam.org] Sri Vaishnava News and learning portal\n* [http://www.antaryami.net www.antaryami.net] Sri Vaishnava News Network\n* [http://guruparamparai.wordpress.com http://guruparamparai.wordpress.com] - Exhaustive/complete details srIvaishNava guru paramparai\n* [http://ponnadi.blogspot.com http://ponnadi.blogspot.com] - Exhaustive articles/archives for the esoteric principles of srIvaishNavam\n* Nathamuni-Alavandar.org Dedicated to Shriman Nathamungal and Shri Alavandar\n* [http://members.tripod.com/~sriramanujar/tVsv.html Vadakalai Vs Thenkalai]\n* http://andaljeeyar.org\n* [http://www.srivaishnavam.com/index.html General information]\n* [http://prapatti.com/ Site for Sri Vaishnava Prayers]\n* http://www.ramanujamission.org/ , (http://vanamamalai.us/) ,\n* http://www.chinnajeeyar.org/main/content/ ,\n* http://www.andaljeeyar.org ,\n* http://www.madhuramangalamjeeyar.org/index.html \n* http://www.shridharacharyaji.com/aboutswamiji.php \n* http://www.sansthanam.com/ , \n* http://www.shrishridhardham.com/ ,\n* http://www.ahobilamutt.org/ ,\n* http://www.parakalamatham.org/ ,\n* http://andavan.org/ ,\n* http://acharyamandir.com/ ,\n* http://www.shreevatsa.com/home.html\n* https://hebbariyengar.net/\n* http://www.hebbarsabha.org/\n* http://mandayamsabha.in/\n* http://vanamamalai.us/\n* http://www.yathirajamutt.org/\n* https://www.facebook.com/HemmigeSriVaishnavaSabha/\n* https://www.facebook.com/telugusrivaishnavasangham/\n* http://www.acharya.org/d.html\n* https://sites.google.com/site/munithrayam/\n* http://www.munitrayam.org/\n* http://www.prapatti.com/index.html\n* https://thillasthanam-swamy-sabha.in/tsksabha/srivaishnavism-saranagathi/\n\n{{Indian philosophy}}\n{{VaisnavaSampradayas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visishtadvaita}}\n[[Category:Hindu philosophy]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Movements in ancient Indian philosophy]]\n[[Category:Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]]\n[[Category:Nondualism]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|One of the most popular schools of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Faith primary|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Ramanujacharya.jpg|thumb|Sri Ramanujacharya (1017-1137 CE), pioneer of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta and the foremost Jeeyar of Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya.]]\n{{Philosophy sidebar}}\n{{Vaishnavism}}\n'''Vishishtadvaita''' ([[IAST]] ''{{IAST|Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita }}''; {{lang-sa|\u0935\u093f\u0936\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924}}) is one of the most popular schools of the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Vedanta]] literally means the ''end of the [[Vedas]].'' ''VishishtAdvaita'' (literally \"[[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] with uniqueness; qualifications\") is a non-dualistic school of Vedanta philosophy. It is [[non-dualism]] of the qualified whole, in which Brahman alone exists, but is characterized by multiplicity. It can be described as qualified monism or qualified non-dualism or attributive [[monism]]. It is a school of Vedanta philosophy which believes in all diversity subsuming to an underlying unity.\n\n[[Ramanuja]], the 11-12th century philosopher and the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy contends that the [[Prasthanatrayi]] (\"The three courses\"), namely the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Gita|Bhagavad Gita]], and the [[Brahmasutra|Brahma Sutras]] are to be interpreted in a way that shows this unity in diversity, for any other way would violate their consistency. [[Vedanta Desika]] defines ''Vishishtadvaita'' using the statement, ''Asesha Chit-Achit Prakaaram Brahmaikameva Tatvam :'' [[Brahman]], as qualified by the sentient and insentient modes (or attributes), is the only reality.{{Hindu philosophy}}\n\n==Philosophers==\nThe Vishishtadvaitic thought is considered to have existed for a long time, and it is surmised that the earliest works are no longer available.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=945}}</ref>  The names of the earliest of these philosophers is only known through [[Ramanuja]]'s ''Vedartha Sangraham''. Bodhayana, Dramida, Tanka, Guhadeva, Kapardi and Bharuci the prominent ones in the line of the philosophers considered to have expounded the Visishtadvaitic system.\n\n[[Bodhayana]] is considered to have written an extensive ''vritti'' (commentary) on the [[Purva Mimamsa|Purva]] and [[Uttara Mimamsa]]s. Tanka is attributed with having written commentaries on [[Chandogya Upanishad]] and Brahma Sutras.  [[Nathamuni]] of the ninth century AD, the foremost [[Acharya]] of the [[Vaishnava]]s, collected the Tamil [[Divya Prabandha|prabandhas]], classified them, made the redaction, set the hymns to music and spread them everywhere.  He is said to have received the divine hymns straight from [[Nammalvar]], the foremost of the twelve [[Alvars]], by yogic insight in the temple at Alwar Thirunagari, which is located near [[Tirunelveli]] in South [[India]]. [[Yamunacharya]] renounced kingship and spent his last days in the service of the Lord at [[Srirangam]] and in laying the fundamentals of the Vishishtadvaita philosophy by writing four basic works on the subject.\n\nRamanuja is the main proponent of Vishishtadvaita philosophy. The philosophy itself is considered to have existed long before Ramanuja's time.<ref name=\"EoH 490\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Constance|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0816073368|pages=490}}</ref>  Ramanuja continues along the line of thought of his predecessors while expounding the knowledge expressed in the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras and Bhagavad Gita. [[Vedanta Desika]] and [[Pillai Lokacharya]], disciples in the tradition of Ramanuja, had minor disagreements not on the [[philosophy]], but on some aspects of the [[theology]], giving rise to the [[Vadakalai]] and [[Thenkalai]] schools of thought, as explained below.\n\n[[Swaminarayan]], the founder of [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]], also propagated this philosophy and based the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]] (original name is [[Uddhava]] Sampraday) on these ideals.<ref name=\"Williams Swaminarayan Vishishtadvait\">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=Introduction to Swaminarayan Hinduism|year=2001|publisher=University of Cambridge Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 65279 0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will/page/35 35]|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will/page/35}}</ref>\n\n== Key principles ==\nThere are three key principles of Vishishtadvaita:{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* ''[[Tattva]]'': The knowledge of the 3 real entities namely, ''[[jiva]]'' (living souls; the sentient); ''[[ajiva]]'' (the nonsentient) and [[Ishvara]] (''Vishnu-Narayana'' or ''Parahbrahman'', Supreme-self and the cause of all manifestations and in-dwelling giver of grace based on Karma).\n* ''[[Hit\u0101|Hita]]'': The means of realization, as through ''[[bhakti]]'' (devotion) and ''[[prapatti]]'' (self-surrender).\n* ''[[Purushartha]]'': The goal to be attained, as ''moksha'' or liberation from bondage.\n\n==Epistemology==\n\n=== Pramanas ===\n''[[Pramana]]'' refers to the correct knowledge, arrived at by thorough reasoning, of any object. ''Pramana'' (\"sources of knowledge\", Sanskrit) forms one part of a ''triputi'' (trio).\n# ''Pramatir'', the ''subject''; the ''knower'' of the knowledge\n# ''Pramana'', the ''cause'' or the ''means'' of the knowledge\n# ''Prameya'', the ''object'' of knowledge\n\nIn Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, only the following three ''pramanas'' are accepted as valid means of knowledge:\n* ''Pratyaksa'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''perception''. Perception refers to knowledge obtained by cognition of external objects based on sensory perception.  In modern-day usage this will also include knowledge obtained by means of observation through scientific instruments since they are an extension of perception.\n* ''Anumana'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''inference''. Inference refers to knowledge obtained by deductive reasoning and analysis.\n* ''[[Shabda]]'' \u2014 the knowledge gained by means of ''[[shruti]]''. ''Shruti'' refers to knowledge gained from scriptures - primarily the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n====Rules of epistemology====\nThere are three rules of hierarchy when there is apparent conflict between the three modes of acquiring knowledge:\n* ''Shabda'' or ''Shruti'', Pramana occupies the highest position in matters which cannot be settled or resolved by ''pratyaksa'' (perception) or by ''anumana'' (inference).\n* ''Anumana'' occupies the next position. When an issue cannot be settled through sensory perception alone, it is settled based on inference, that is, whichever is the more logical argument.\n* When ''pratyaksa'' yields a definitive position on a particular issue, such a perception cannot be ignored by interpreting ''Shabda'' in a way which violates that perception.\n\n==Metaphysics==\n\n===Ontology===\n\nThe [[ontology]] in Vishishtadvaita consists of explaining the relationship between [[Ishvara]] (''Parabrahman''), the sentient beings (''chit-brahman'') and the insentient Universe (''achit-brahman''). In the broadest sense, Ishvara is the Universal Soul of the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings. The three ontological entities are described below:\n\n====Ishvara====\n\n[[Ishvara]] (denoted by Vishnu-Narayana) is the Supreme Cosmic Spirit who maintains complete control over the Universe and all the sentient beings, which together also form the pan-organistic body of Ishvara. The triad of Ishvara along with the universe and the sentient beings is Brahman, which signifies the completeness of existence. Ishvara is Parabrahman endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities (Kalyana Gunas). Ishvara is perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, the creator of the universe, its active ruler and also its eventual destroyer.<ref>White Yajurveda 32.3</ref> He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable \u2014 and is yet the material and the efficient cause of the universe and sentient beings. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one's Karma. He rules the world with His Maya \u2014 His divine power.\n\nIshvara is considered to have a 2-fold characteristic: he is the indweller of all beings and all beings dwell in Ishvara.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n=====Antarvyapi=====\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the indweller of all beings, he is referred to as the [[Paramatman]], or the innermost self of all beings.\n\n''He who inhabits water, yet is within water, whom water does not know, whose body water is and who controls water from within \u2014 He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.''\n\n''He who inhabits the sun, yet is within the sun, whom the sun does not know, whose body the sun is and who controls the sun from within \u2014 He is your Self, the Inner Controller, the Immortal'' - [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 3.7.4-14\n\n=====Bahuvyapi=====\n\nWhen Ishvara is thought of as the all encomposing and the residence of all beings that is, all beings reside in Ishvara, he is referred to as the paramapurusha. The sentient beings and the insentient universe which form part of the pan-organistic body of Ishvara are encapsulated by Ishvara.{{Original research inline|date=April 2008}}\n\n''Sarvam khalvidam Brahma'' [[Chandogya Upanishad]]\n\n''Isavasyam idam sarvam'' [[Isha Upanishad]]\n\n====Chit====\n\n[[Satchitananda|Chit]] is the world of sentient beings, or of entities possessing consciousness. It is similar to the [[Purusha]] of Samkhya system. The sentient beings are called J\u012bv\u0101s and they are possessors of individual consciousness as denoted by \"I\". The scope of Chit refers to all beings with an \"I\" consciousness, or more specifically self-awareness. Therefore, all entities which are aware of their own individual existence are denoted as ''chit''. This is called ''Dharmi-jnana'' or ''substantive consciousness''. The sentient beings also possess varying levels of ''Dharma-bhuta-jnana'' or ''attributive consciousness''\n\nThe jivas possess three different types of existence:\n* ''Nityas'', or the eternally free Jivas who were never in [[Samsara]]\n* ''Muktas'', or the Jivas that were once in Samsara but are free\n* ''Baddhas'', or the Jivas which are still in Samsara\n\n====Achit====\n[[Achit (metaphysics)|Achit]] is the world of insentient entities as denoted by matter or more specifically the non-conscious Universe. It is similar to the [[Prakriti]] of Samkhya system.\n\n====Brahman====\nThere is a subtle difference between Ishvara and Brahman. Ishvara is the substantive part of Brahman, while jivas and jagat are its modes (also secondary attributes), and kalyanagunas (auspicious attributes) are the primary attributes. The secondary attributes become manifested in the effect state when the world is differentiated by name and form. The kalyanagunas are eternally manifest.\n\n''Brahman is the description of Ishvara when comprehended in fullness\u2013 i.e., a simultaneous vision of Ishvara with all his modes and attributes. ''\n\nThe relationship between Brahman and Jivas, Jagat is expressed by R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 in numerous ways. He calls this relationship as one of:\n* '''sharIra/sharIrI (\u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930/ \u0936\u0930\u0940\u0930\u0940)'''        (''body/indweller'');\n* '''prakAra/prakArI'''      (''attribute or mode/substance'');\n* '''\u200cshesha/sheshi'''          (''Owned/owner'');\n* '''amsha/amshI'''            (''part/whole'');\n* '''AdhAradeya/sambandha''' (''supporter/supported'');\n* '''niyamya/niyanta'''      (''controlled/controller'');\n* '''rashksya/rakshaka'''      (''redeemed/redeemer'');\n\nThese relationships can be experienced holding Brahman as the father, son, mother, sister, wife, husband, friend, lover and lord. Hence, Brahman is a personal being.\n* What does Nirguna Brahman mean?\n\nRamanuja argues vehemently against understanding Brahman as one without attributes. Brahman is Nirguna in the sense that impure qualities do not touch it. He provides three valid reasons for staking such a claim:\n\nShruti/Shabda Pramana: All shrutis and shabdas denoting Brahman always list either attributes inherent to Brahman or not inherent to Brahman. The shrutis only seek to deny Brahman from possessing impure and defective qualities which affect the world of beings. There is evidence in the shrutis to this regard. The shrutis proclaim Brahman to be beyond the tri-gunas which are observed. However, Brahman possesses an infinite number of transcendental attributes, the evidence of which is given in vakhyas like \"satyam jnanam anantam Brahma\" ([[Taittiriya Upanishad]]).\n\nPratyaksha Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"a contentless cognition is impossible\". And all cognition must necessarily involve knowing Brahman through the attributes of Brahman.\n\nAnumana Pramana: Ramanuja states that \"Nirgunatva\" itself becomes an attribute of Brahman on account of the uniqueness of no other entity being Nirguna.\nRamanuja had simplified relationship between bramha and soul.According to him though soul is integral part of bramha it has independent existence.<ref>J.L.Mehta VOl3</ref>\n\n===Theory of Existence===\nThe three ontological entities i.e. Ishvara, Chit and Achit are fundamentally real. It upholds the doctrine of ''[[Satkaryavada]]'' as against ''[[Asatkaryavada]]''.\n\nBriefly,\n* Satkaryavada is pre-existence of the effect in the cause. It maintains that karya (effect) is sat or real.  It is present in the karana (cause) in a potential form, even before its manifestation.\n* Asatkaryavada is non-existence of the effect in the cause.  It maintains that karya (effect) is asat or unreal until it comes into being.  Every effect, then, is a new beginning and is not born out of cause.\n\nMore specifically, the effect is a modification of what exists in the cause and does not involve new entities coming into existence.  This is called as ''parinamavada'' or evolution of effect from the cause.  This doctrine is common to the Samkhya system and Vishishtadvaita system.  The Samkhya system adheres to Prakriti-Parinama vada whereas Vishishtadvaita is a modified form of Brahma-Parinama vada.\n\n==== {{IAST|K\u0101rya and k\u0101rana}} ====\n\nThe {{IAST|k\u0101rana}} (''cause'') and {{IAST|k\u0101rya}} (''effect'') in Vishishtadvaita is different from other systems of [[Indian philosophy]]. Brahman is both the {{IAST|k\u0101rana}} (''cause'') and the {{IAST|k\u0101rya}} (''effect'').  Brahman as the cause '''does not''' become the Universe as the effect.\n\nBrahman is assigned two {{IAST|k\u0101ranatvas}} (''ways of being the cause''):\n\n# {{IAST|Nimitta k\u0101ranatva}} \u2014 ''Being the Efficient/ Instrumental cause''. For example, a goldsmith is assigned {{IAST|Nimitta k\u0101ranatva}} as he acts as the maker of jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''Instrumental cause''.\n# {{IAST|Up\u0101d\u0101na k\u0101ranatva}} \u2014 ''Being the material cause''. For example, the gold is assigned {{IAST|Up\u0101d\u0101na k\u0101ranatva}} as it acts as the material of the jewellery and thus becomes the jewellery's ''material cause''.\n\nAccording to Vishishtadvaita, the Universe and Sentients always exist. However, they begin from a subtle state and undergo transformation. The subtle state is called a causal state, while the transformed state is called the effect state. The causal state is when Brahman is internally not distinguishable by name and form.\n\nIt can be said that Vishishtadvaita follows '''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|Brahma-Prakara-Parinama Vada]]'''. That is to say, it is the modes (Jivas and Jagath) of Brahman which is under evolution. The cause and effect only refer to the pan-organistic body transformation. Brahman as the Universal Self is unchanging and eternal.\n\nBrahman having the subtle (s\u016bkshma) chit and achit entities as his ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' before manifestation is the same Brahman having the expanded (st\u016bla) chit and achit entities as ''Saareeram/Prakaaram(body/mode)'' after manifestation.\n\nThe essential feature is that the underlying entity is the same, the changes are in the description of that entity.\n\nFor e.g. ''Jack was a baby. Jack was a small kid. Jack was a middle-aged person. Jack was an old man. Jack is dead''\n\nThe body of a single personality named Jack is described as continuously changing. Jack does not become \"James\" because of the change.\n\n==Ethics==\n\nSouls and Matter are only the body of God. Creation is a real act of God. It is the expansion of intelligence. Matter is fundamentally real and undergoes real revelation. The Soul is a higher mode than Matter, because it is conscious. It is also eternally real and eternally distinct. Final release, that comes, by the Lord's [[divine grace|Grace]], after the death of the body is a Communion with God. This philosophy believes in liberation through one's [[Karma]]s (actions) in accordance with the Vedas, the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]] ([[caste]] or class) system and the four [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashramas]] (stages of life), along with intense devotion to Vishnu. Individual Souls retain their separate identities even after moksha. They live in Fellowship with God either serving Him or meditating on Him. The philosophy of this school is SriVaishnavism, a branch of [[Vaishnavism]].\n\n==Interpretation of Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas==\n1. sarvam khalv idam brahma''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 3.14.1\n\nTranslated literally, this means ''All this is Brahman''. The ontology of Vishishtadvaita system consists of:\n\na. Ishvara is ''Para-brahman'' with infinite superlative qualities, whose substantive nature imparts the existence to the modes\n\nb. Jivas are ''chit-brahman'' or sentient beings (which possess consciousness). They are the modes of Brahman which show consciousness.\n\nc. Jagat is ''achit-brahman'' or matter/Universe (which are non-conscious). They are the mode of Brahman which are not conscious.\n\nBrahman is the composite whole of the triad consisting of Ishvara along with his modes i.e. Jivas and Jagat.\n\n2. ayam \u0101tm\u0101 brahma''' from [[Mandukya Upanishad]] 1.2\n\nTranslated literally, this means the ''Self is Brahman''.\nFrom the earlier statement, it follows that on account of everything being Brahman, the self is not different from Brahman.\n\n3. Tat tvam asi''' from [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 6.8.7\n\nTranslated literally, it means ''Thou art that''\n\n''that'' here refers to ''Brahman'' and ''thou'' refers to ''jiva''\n\nR\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as ''sam\u0101n\u0101dhikaranya''. Thus R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101 says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (''Parabrahman'') who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also  simultaneously the innermost self (Atm\u0101n) for each individual sentient being (J\u012bv\u0101). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprthak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.\n\nTat Tvam Asi declares that oneness of Isvara.\n\nWhen multiple entities point to a single object, the relationship is established as one of substance and its attributes.\n\nFor e.g. in a statement:\n\n''Jack is a tall and intelligent boy''\n\nThe descriptors ''tall-ness'',''intelligence'' and ''boy-ness'' all refer to a common underlying ''Jack''\n\nSimilarly, when the upanishads declare Brahman is the Universe, Purusha, Self, Prana, Vayu, and so on, the entities are attributes or modes of Brahman.\n\nIf the statement '''tat tvam asi''' is taken to mean as only ''the self is brahman'', then '''sarvam khalv idam brahma''' will not make sense.\n\n===Understanding Neti-Neti===\n{{Original research|date=April 2008}}\nThis is an upanishadic concept which is employed while attempting to know Brahman. The purport of this exercise is understood in many different ways and also influences the understanding of Brahman.\nIn the overall sense, this phrase is accepted to refer to the indescribable nature of Brahman who is beyond all rationalisations.\n\nTaittiriya Upanishad 2-9-1 passage \"yato vacho nivartanthe..\"  (words recoil, mind can not grasp...) etc., state the same concept regarding Brahman .  The visishtadvaita interpretation is that these passages do not indicate  a black hole, but the incompleteness of any statement or thought or concept concerning Brahman.  Brahman is these and more. This interpretation is consistent with \"sarvam kalvidam brahma\".  Antaryami Brahmanam of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad passage \"yasya prithvi sariram yasya atma sariram\"  is also interpreted to show that Brahman is not a zero point - \"nirvisesha chinmatra\" (an entity which has nothing except existence)\n\nThe typical interpretation of Neti-Neti is ''not this, not this'' or ''neither this, nor that''. It is a phrase meant to convey the inexpressibility of Brahman in words and the futility of trying to approximate Brahman with conceptual models.In VisishtAdvaita, the phrase is taken in the sense of ''not just this, not just this'' or ''not just this, not just that''. This means that Brahman cannot be restricted to one specific or a few specific descriptions. Consequently, Brahman is understood to possess infinite qualities and each of these qualities are infinite in extent.\n\n==Purpose of human existence==\nThe purpose or goal of human existence is called [[purushartha]]. According to the Vedas, there are four goals namely [[artha]] (wealth), [[kama]] (pleasure), [[dharma]] (righteousness) and [[moksha]] (permanent freedom from worldly bondage). According to this philosophy, the first three goals are not an end by themselves but need to be pursued with the ideal of attaining moksha.\n\n===Moksha===\nMoksha means liberation or release from [[samsara]], the cycle of rebirth.\n\n===Bhakti as the means of attaining  moksha===\n[[Bhakti]] is the sole means of liberation in Vishishtadvaita. Through [[Bhakti]] (devotion), a [[Jiva]] ascends to [[Vaikuntha]], where it continues to delight in His service in a body which is [[Satcitananda|''sat-cit-ananda'']]. Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are sub processes of Bhakti, total surrender, as the devotee acquires the knowledge that the Lord is the inner self. A devotee realizes his own state as dependent on, and supported by, and being led by the Lord, who is the Master. One is to lead a life as an instrument of the Lord, offering all his [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word, and deed]] to the feet of the Lord. One is to see the Lord in everything and everything in Him. This is the unity in diversity achieved through devotion.<ref>http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9014610686337442954</ref>\nHowever Sri [[Ramanuja]] accepts Saranagati, total surrender at the Lord's lotus feet alone as the sole means to moksha. Wherein, moksha is defined as liberation from samsara and going to Vaikuntha to serve [[Narayana]] ([[Venkateswara|Balaji]])in a spiritual body. This is a distinguishing feature of this school of philosophy, as both Adishankara's advaita and [[Madhvacharya|Anandatirtha's]] dvaita accept bhakthi for two different concepts of moksha. Swami Ramanuja has supported this opinion with various citations directly from the vedas, and various incidents highlighting sharangathi as means to attain personal stay in the realm of Vaikuntha. Observing total surrender at the Lord's feet guarantees moksha at the end of this birth, and in the time between sharanagathi and death, the surrendered soul must spend his time performing the nice forms of devotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/7/5/23-24/|title=9 forms of bhakti|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> So bhakthi is not a moksha sadhana, but for [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)|anubhava]] and reaching Vaikuntha, in the Vishishtadvaita Sampradaya\n\n== Thenkalai and Vadakalai schools of thought ==\nThe [[Vadakalai]]  sect of Sri Vaishnavism associate themselves with [[Vedanta Desikan]] and Ramanujacharya. Vedanta Desikan is one of the foremost learned scholars and philosophers of medieval India, who has written more than a hundred works in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Prakrit]] and [[Manipravalam|Manipravala]].  He is said to have been born as an incarnation of the divine bell of Lord [[Venkateswara|Venkateshwara]] of [[Tirupati]] and also of [[Ramanuja]]charya in the month of [[Purattasi]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1268 CE. All of his works are characterized by his versatility, irrefutable reasoning, logic, examination, deep spiritual insight, ethical fervour and excellent expressions of devotional emotion in delightful style. His [[Paduka-sahasram]] and ''Rahasyatrayasaram'' are some classic examples.  He was a great teacher, logician, expositor, debater, poet, philosopher, thinker and defender of the faith of Vaishnavism. \"''Kavitaarkika Simham\"'' (lion among poets and debaters), ''\"Sarvatantra Svatantrar\"'' (all-knowing and all-powerful), ''\"Vedaantaachaarya\"'' (the master and preceptor of the Vedanta) are some of the titles attributed to him.\n\n[[Pillai Lokacharya]] literally meaning \"Teacher for the whole world\" is one of the leading lights on the Sri Vaishnava Vedanta philosophy. His work Sri Vachana Bhusanam is a classic and provides the essence of Upanishads. The [[Tenkalai]] sect of [[Sri Vaishnavism]] looks up to him apart from Swami Ramanuja and Swami Manavala Mamuni. He was a senior contemporary of Vedanta Desika. He is said to have been born as an ''amsa'' (\"essence\") of Kanchi Devaraja (Varadaraja) Perumal to document and immortalize Ramanuja's message in the month of [[Tamil months#Months|Aippaci]] under the star [[Hindu calendar#Nakshatra|Thiruvonam (Sravana)]], in the year 1205 CE.<ref name=\"PQM 946\">{{cite book|last=Chandrankunnel|first=Matthew|title=Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics|year=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|location=New Delhi|page=946}}</ref>  He is said to have lived for 106 years, during which time, he also helped to safeguard the idol of [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple (Srirangam)|Ranganatha]] at [[Srirangam]] from [[Muslim]] invaders.<ref name=\"PQM 946\" />  Pillai Lokacharya confirmed the basics of the Sri Vaishnava system in his 18 monumental works popularly known as ''Ashtadasa Rahasyangal'' (\"the eighteen secrets\") also called the [[Rahasya granthas]] (\"doctrines that explain the inner meanings\") out of which Sri Vachana Bhushanam and Mumukshuppadi are the most famous. [[Manavala Mamuni]] expanded on and popularized Lokacharya's teachings arguments in Tamil.\n\n==Traditions following Vishishtadvaita==\n* [[Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya]] of south India.\n* [[Ramanandi Sampradaya|Sri Ramanandi Sect]] of Northern India, it has the largest monastic order in whole India.\n* [[Sri Swaminarayan Sampraday]] of Gujarat.\n* D\u0101modariya Vai\u015b\u0146ava sampraday of Assam.\n\n=== Visishtadvaita and Sri Vaishnavism ===\n\nThe Absolute Supreme Reality referred to as Brahman, is a Transcendent Personality. He is Narayana, also known as Lord Vishnu.\n\n''A man who has discrimination for his charioteer and holds the reins of the mind firmly, reaches the end of the road; and that is the supreme position of Vishnu.'' - 1.3.9 [[Katha Upanishad]]\n\n''Beyond the senses are the objects; beyond the objects is the mind; beyond the mind, the intellect; beyond the intellect, the Great Atman; beyond the Great Atman, the Unmanifest; beyond the Unmanifest, the Purusha. Beyond the Purusha there is nothing: this is the end, the Supreme Goal.''- 1.3.10,11 [[Katha Upanishad]]\n\nIn terms of theology, Ramanujacharya puts forth the view that both the Supreme Goddess Lakshmi and Supreme God Narayana together constitute Brahman - the Absolute. Sri Lakshmi is the female personification of Brahman and Narayana is the male personification of Brahman, but they are both inseparable, co-eternal, co-absolute and are always substantially one. Thus, in reference to these dual aspects of Brahman, the Supreme is referred to in the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya as Sriman Narayana.\n\nThe most striking difference between Srivaishnavas and other Vaishnava groups lies in their interpretation of Vedas. While other Vaishnava groups interpret Vedic deities like Indra, Savitar, Bhaga, Rudra, etc. to be same as their Puranic counterparts, Srivaishnavas consider these to be different names/roles/forms of Lord Narayan citing solid reasons thus claiming that the entire Veda is dedicated for Vishnu worship alone. Srivaishnavas have remodelled Pancharatra homas like Sudarshana homa, etc. to include Vedic Suktas like Rudram in them, thus giving them a Vedic outlook.\n\n==Summary==\nNarayana is the Absolute God. The Soul and the Universe are only parts of this Absolute and hence, Vishishtadvaita is the solution to [[panentheistic]] and [[pantheistic]] ideologies. The relationship of God to the Soul and the Universe is like the relationship of the Soul of Man to the body of Man. Individual souls are only parts of Brahman. God, Soul and Universe together form an inseparable unity which is one and has no second.  This is the non-duality part. Matter and Souls inhere in that Ultimate Reality as attributes to a substance [needs to improvisation]. This is the qualification part of the non-duality.\n\nAccording to the Vishishtadvaita school, Brahman (the supreme being or ultimate reality) and the individual souls are different with a potential to unite. The Universe can be thought of as the ocean which is primarily composed of water (the Supreme being). But it also contains fishes and other organisms (the individual souls) living in it. The individual souls can unite with the supreme being based upon their actions and deeds. In our example, the individual souls, that is the fishes dissolve into the water, that is merge with the Supreme being once they die and are absorbed by the ocean (the Universe). Of course, as in other Hindu schools of thought, the individual souls will continue this cycle of birth, death and re-birth until they attain moksha or liberation. There are different paths to liberation based upon the school. In Vishishtadvaita, moksha or liberation can be attained by ''loving'' god. In  Adi vaita Vendanta, the path to liberation is by gaining ''Vidya'' or knawl etge.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Turiya]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/a-history-of-indian-philosophy-volume-3/d/doc209953.html ''{{IAST|Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita}}'' doctrine of Soul according to ''{{IAST|R\u0101m\u0101nuja}}'' and ''{{IAST|Ve\u1e45ka\u1e6dan\u0101tha}}''], Surendranath Dasgupta, 1940\n* Biographies of [http://www.bharatadesam.com/people/ramanujacharya.php Ramanuja] and [http://www.bharatadesam.com/people/vedanta_deshikar.php Vedanta Desika]\n* [http://www.srivaishnavan.com Ramanuja and VisishtAdvaita]\n* [http://sriranganatha.tripod.com more information]\n* [http://shankaracharya.org Advaita and VisishtAdvaita]\n* [http://www.dlshq.org/download/hinduismbk.htm#_VPID_96 more information]\n* http://www.vaishnava.com/shrivaishnavaintro.htm\n* http://www.hinduweb.org/home/dharma_and_philosophy/vvh/vvh.htm\n* http://www.hinduweb.org/home/dharma_and_philosophy/vvh/raghavan.html\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ramanuja.org/intro.html Introduction to Sri Vaishnava Philosophy]\n* [http://www.srivaishnavam.com/index.html srivaishnavam.com-Good website on general info]\n* [http://www.anudinam.org www.anudinam.org] Sri Vaishnava News and learning portal\n* [http://www.antaryami.net www.antaryami.net] Sri Vaishnava News Network\n* [http://guruparamparai.wordpress.com http://guruparamparai.wordpress.com] - Exhaustive/complete details srIvaishNava guru paramparai\n* [http://ponnadi.blogspot.com http://ponnadi.blogspot.com] - Exhaustive articles/archives for the esoteric principles of srIvaishNavam\n* Nathamuni-Alavandar.org Dedicated to Shriman Nathamungal and Shri Alavandar\n* [http://members.tripod.com/~sriramanujar/tVsv.html Vadakalai Vs Thenkalai]\n* http://andaljeeyar.org\n* [http://www.srivaishnavam.com/index.html General information]\n* [http://prapatti.com/ Site for Sri Vaishnava Prayers]\n* http://www.ramanujamission.org/ , (http://vanamamalai.us/) ,\n* http://www.chinnajeeyar.org/main/content/ ,\n* http://www.andaljeeyar.org ,\n* http://www.madhuramangalamjeeyar.org/index.html \n* http://www.shridharacharyaji.com/aboutswamiji.php \n* http://www.sansthanam.com/ , \n* http://www.shrishridhardham.com/ ,\n* http://www.ahobilamutt.org/ ,\n* http://www.parakalamatham.org/ ,\n* http://andavan.org/ ,\n* http://acharyamandir.com/ ,\n* http://www.shreevatsa.com/home.html\n* https://hebbariyengar.net/\n* http://www.hebbarsabha.org/\n* http://mandayamsabha.in/\n* http://vanamamalai.us/\n* http://www.yathirajamutt.org/\n* https://www.facebook.com/HemmigeSriVaishnavaSabha/\n* https://www.facebook.com/telugusrivaishnavasangham/\n* http://www.acharya.org/d.html\n* https://sites.google.com/site/munithrayam/\n* http://www.munitrayam.org/\n* http://www.prapatti.com/index.html\n* https://thillasthanam-swamy-sabha.in/tsksabha/srivaishnavism-saranagathi/\n\n{{Indian philosophy}}\n{{VaisnavaSampradayas}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visishtadvaita}}\n[[Category:Hindu philosophy]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Movements in ancient Indian philosophy]]\n[[Category:Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]]\n[[Category:Nondualism]]\n", "name_user": "Nittawinoda", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishishtadvaita"}
