The Barb generally possesses a fiery temperament and an atypical sport-horse [[Equine conformation|conformation]], but nevertheless has influenced modern breeds.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Barb is a light riding horse noted for its stamina. It has a powerful front end, high [[withers]], short [[back (horse)|back]], a sloping [[rump (animal)|croup]], and carries its [[tail (horse)|tail]] low. It is hardy with clean legs and sound [[horse hoof|hooves]]. It does not have particularly good gaits, but gallops like a sprinter. It was used as breeding stock to develop racing breeds such as the [[Thoroughbred]], [[American Quarter Horse]], and [[Standardbred]].<ref>Reddick, Kate, ''Horses''. New York: Ridge Press, 1976, p. 60.</ref>\n\nThe predominant [[Equine coat color|color]] is [[gray (horse)|gray]], but [[Bay (horse)|bay]], [[Black (horse)|black]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], and [[seal brown (horse)|brown]] horses are also found. The Barb stands {{convert|1.47|-|1.57|m|hand|lk=out}} at the [[withers]].<ref name=\"edwards\">Edwards, Elwyn Hartley (1994). ''The Encyclopedia of the Horse,'' London: Dorling Kindersley {{ISBN|0-7513-0115-9}} p.67</ref>\n\n== Breed history ==\n\nIt is not known where the Barb horse developed; some believe the breed originated in northern Africa during the 8th century, about the time that Muslim invaders reached the region. There is controversy over whether the Barb and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] horses share a common ancestor, or if the Arabian was a predecessor of the Barb. Native horses of the region may have been influenced by the crossing of \"oriental\" breeds, including the Arabian horse, [[Turkoman Horse]] or [[Akhal-Teke]], and [[Caspian Pony|Caspian horse]], with Iberian horses brought back from Europe by the [[Berbers|Berber]] invaders after they conquered southern [[Spain]].<ref>Nissen, Jasper, ''The Young Specialist Looks At Horses''. London: Burke Publishing Co. Ltd, 1963, p. 46.</ref> Today the several varieties of Barb include the Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian.\n\nWhen imported to Europe, the Barbs were sometimes mistaken for Arabians, although they have distinctly different physical characteristics. The Europeans saw that their size was similar and their handlers were Berber [[Muslims]] who spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. An example of such confusion is that the [[Godolphin Arabian]], one of the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of the [[Thoroughbred]], was an Arabian stallion but, due to his [[Tunisia]]n origins, was referred to as the \"Godolphin Barb.\"<ref>Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. ''The Authentic Arabian Horse,'' 3rd ed. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1979.</ref><!-- needs page number, will have to add later -->\n\nThe Barb is now bred primarily in Morocco, [[Algeria]], Spain and southern [[France]]. Due to difficult economic times in North Africa, the number of purebred Barbs is decreasing.

The Barb generally possesses a fiery temperament and an atypical sport-horse [[Equine conformation|conformation]], but nevertheless has influenced modern breeds.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Barb is a light riding horse noted for its stamina.

It is hardy with clean legs and sound [[horse hoof|hooves]]. It does not have particularly good gaits, but gallops like a sprinter.

''The Encyclopedia of the Horse,'' London: Dorling Kindersley {{ISBN|0-7513-0115-9}} p.67</ref>\n\n== Breed history ==\n\nIt is not known where the Barb horse developed; some believe the breed originated in northern Africa during the 8th century, about the time that Muslim invaders reached the region. There is controversy over whether the Barb and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] horses share a common ancestor, or if the Arabian was a predecessor of the Barb. Native horses of the region may have been influenced by the crossing of \"oriental\" breeds, including the Arabian horse, [[Turkoman Horse]] or [[Akhal-Teke]], and [[Caspian Pony|Caspian horse]], with Iberian horses brought back from Europe by the [[Berbers|Berber]] invaders after they conquered southern [[Spain]].<ref>Nissen, Jasper, ''The Young Specialist Looks At Horses''. London: Burke Publishing Co. Ltd, 1963, p. 46.</ref> Today the several varieties of Barb include the Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian.\n\nWhen imported to Europe, the Barbs were sometimes mistaken for Arabians, although they have distinctly different physical characteristics. The Europeans saw that their size was similar and their handlers were Berber [[Muslims]] who spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. An example of such confusion is that the [[Godolphin Arabian]], one of the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of the [[Thoroughbred]], was an Arabian stallion but, due to his [[Tunisia]]n origins, was referred to as the \"Godolphin Barb.\"<ref>Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton.

The Bannock totaled about 600 to 800 in 1870--this being due to other Soshonean peoples being included with Bannock numbers<ref>Ruby, Robert H., and John Arthur Brown (1992). \u201cBannock.\u201d In ''A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 7-9.</ref>; they were led by Chief [[Buffalo Horn]] who was killed in action in June 8, 1878.<ref>Ruby, Robert H., and John Arthur Brown (1992). \u201cBannock.\u201d 8.</ref> After his death, Chief [[Egan (Paiute)|Egan]] led the Bannocks. He and some of his warriors were killed in July, by a [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] party who entered his camp in [[Deception|subterfuge]].\n\nThe U.S. military, consisting of the 21st Infantry Regiment and volunteers, was led by Brigadier General [[Oliver O. Howard]]. Nearby states also sent militias to the region. The conflict ended in August and September 1878, when the remaining scattered Bannock-Paiute forces surrendered; many returned to [[Fort Hall Reservation]]. The US Army forced some 543 Paiute, from Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock prisoners to be interned at [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] in southeastern [[Washington Territory]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe Bannock people had developed as a distinct group from the Northern Paiute nation of northern Idaho. During the 18th century, these Paiute had traveled south to the [[Snake River]] plain of present-day Idaho, attracted by the prospect of an alliance with the linguistically similar and equestrian [[Shoshone people]]. It was during this period that these Paiute became known as Bannock. The Bannocks quickly adopted the Shoshone's equestrian culture and made other ties through intermarriage with the Shoshone. The Bannock provided increased security and population for the Shoshone, who had lost many members due to epidemics of infectious disease contracted from Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heaton|first=John W.|title=The Shoshone-Bannocks : Culture & Commerce at Fort Hall, 1870\u20131940|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence|isbn=0700614028|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival of European Americans ===\nBy the time the American [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] arrived in this area of present-day southern Idaho in 1805, the Bannock-Shoshone had been trading for some time with representatives of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[North West Company]] from British Canada. They quickly opened trade with Americans for firearms and horses, as they had done with other European traders for years. The Shoshone-Bannock remained independent, despite their continued reliance on American trade. They participated in the Rocky Mountain [[fur trade]], which ended about 1840.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 32\u201333</ref> This era of positive cooperation with American trade declined in the 1850s, along with the fur trade, under pressure of increased migration of Euro-Americans to the Snake Valley plain. The discovery of gold in the Boise Basin and the Beaverhead country of Montana had attracted prospectors and traders, who moved through the Snake region, competing for game and water resources as they traveled. The American traders and migrants were an established presence in the Snake region by the mid-1860s, affecting a vast majority of the Shoshone-Bannock inhabitants.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 37</ref>\n[[File:SRPncw.jpg|thumbnail|right|Snake River Plain]]\n\nThe Shoshone-Bannock were dramatically influenced by arrival of Euroamericans and the rapid expansion of the trade-based economy. On a cultural level, the Euroamericans' way of life challenged the values and seasonal traditions of the Shoshone-Bannock. New practices of agriculture, managing livestock, and production replaced the traditional resources on which the Shoshone-Bannocks had relied. They became more dependent on Euroamerican methods and products.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nAmerican leaders were eager to acquire lands from the Shoshone-Bannock and in the 1860s, began to work to trade goods for titles to the Snake River Plains. The land trade attracted new waves of migrants to the Idaho territory, especially in the [[Boise]] region of the Snake Valley. In 1866, in order to protect the Shoshone-Bannock groups in the Boise Snake Valley from fearful and aggressive settlers, Governor [[Lyon]] created a refugee camp for a few hundred of the Bannock near Boise City. The camp's lack of sufficient resources forced the Shoshone-Bannock to depend on the local settlers for work and food. Many Shoshone-Bannock asked to be given the security of their own reservation land.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 41</ref>\n\nThe proposed relocation to eastern Idaho challenged the Shoshone-Bannock cosmology and their religious connection to the land, as their cultural practices were based in local seasonal changes in the Snake Valley. They believed their ancestors' spirits still resided in the land.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 43</ref> Leadership among the Shoshone-Bannock was believed to be directly connected to the land which these ancestors inhabited, granting the chief his position. After complex and controversial deliberation, the Shoshone-Bannock leaders and American government officials formally agreed to relocate the Boise refugees to the Fort Hall Reservation. They completed relocation in 1869.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 45</ref>\n\n===Life at Fort Hall===\nThe [[Fort Hall Reservation]] was a 1.8 million-acre plot along the Upper [[Snake River]] in eastern Idaho, on the river's southeastern banks. The region had potential for irrigation and agriculture, but the Shoshone-Bannock faced immediate survival challenges due to their dependence on native foods and buffalo found off-reservation, and the government's encouragement for them to abandon this practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Robin|last2=Ruby|first2=Robert H.|last3=Brown|first3=John A.|date=1988|title=A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=12|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.2307/1183804|issn=0095-182X|jstor=1183804}}</ref> The population was very dense for the land, numbering 1,037 in 1872. The Shoshone-Bannock struggled to live by subsistence.\n\nWhile the government made sizable appropriations to purchase the supplies necessary to feed the community, food crises arose during the winters of 1874\u20131875 and 1876\u20131877, resulting from diminished game for hunters and a lack of adequate food supplies by the government. Many Shoshone-Bannock left Fort Hall to attempt survival on their own.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 48\u201349</ref> Simultaneously, the 1877 [[Nez Perce War]] drove officials to crack down on the nation and require them to stay within the reservation boundaries.\n\nThe Bannock War of 1878 resulted from numerous factors.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 50</ref> The terrible conditions caused divisions within the Shoshone-Bannock communities. The Bannock began to view the Shoshone as intruders and committed theft and other crimes against the group. Friction between the Native Americans and the Euroamericans increased as well, resulting in violence when Pe-tope, a Fort Hill Native American, shot and wounded two teamsters in August 1877. Agent William Danilson, the government-appointed agent of the Fort Hall reservation at the time, pressed the tribal leaders to charge Pe-tope for the crime. In response to the crackdown, a friend of Pe-tope, ''Nampe-yo-go,'' killed Alexander Rhodan, a beef contractor for the reservation.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nAgent Danilson asked the nation to capture the killer and turn him over to the US officials, but he was resisted by the Shoshone-Bannock. According to their tradition of reconciliation, they said it was the duty of the family of Nampe-yo-go to resolve his crime, not the nation. That summer, a large number of the Shoshone-Bannock left the reservation, because of the lack of supplies, violence between the Native Americans and the Euroamericans, conflicts between the nations, and Danilson's actions. This sparked the Bannock War of 1878, as the US government ordered the Army to return the people to the reservation to control them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heaton|first=John W.|title=The Shoshone-Bannocks : culture & commerce at Fort Hall, 1870\u20131940|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence|isbn=0700614028|pages=51}}</ref>\n\n== The battles ==\n\n=== Camas Prairie===\nIn May 1878, Chief Buffalo assembled 200 Bannock warriors from Fort Hall at Payne's Ferry on the Snake River, moving to the Big Camas Prairie to set up camp. At that time the region between the Big Camas Prairie and the Snake River was occupied by a few white settlers, 2500 cattle, and 80 horses.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brimlow|first=George Brimlow|title=The Bannock Indian War of 1878|year=1938|publisher=The Caxton Printers Ltd|location=Caldwell, Idaho|page=74}}</ref> On May 30 the Bannock group, after trying to sell a buffalo skin robe to cowboys on the plain, shot two in an altercation. Lou Kensler and George Nesby survived their wounds and traveled with the third member of their party, William Silvey, to the nearby Baker's camp.<!--Need explanation - is Baker a family? an official group?--><ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 75</ref> Not long after this incident, the Bannock at a camp near the Lava Beds were attacked by white men. They killed a settler in the conflict but lost their camp's resources.\n\nThe news of the increased violence spread to Idaho's state capital in Boise City. Governor [[Brayman]] notified Brigadier General [[O. O. Howard]], commander of the Military Department of the Columbia. Brayman wrote in a May 30 letter that he had dispatched Col. Bernard's cavalry from Boise to the plains that evening as a show of force; he did not want to provoke further conflict.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 80</ref> Bernard's cavalry reached the Bannock camp on June 2 and drove them to retreat to the Lava Beds. The military noted this was better for defense.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 81</ref> The Bannock group moved west and raided Glenn's Ferry and King Hill station, both on the Snake River. Next, they moved along the river, killing several settlers along the way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Brigham D|title=The Bannock Indians in Northwest History|year=1948|publisher=University of California|location=California|page=187}}</ref> Bernard's cavalry traveled by road to Rattlesnake station, where they joined with more military cavalry, as well as local [[militia]] volunteers from Alturas.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 82</ref> At this time, Bernard claimed there were 300 Bannock warriors in the Lava Beds, plus 200 who had raided Glenn's Ferry and King Hill Station. The Bannock were rushing westward to meet with their [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] allies, who were traveling down the [[Owyhee River]] to the [[Juniper Mountains]] and Lava Canyon.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 88</ref>\n\n=== Conflicts between Army and Bannock ===\nOn June 8 a group of 26 volunteer military men from [[Silver City, Idaho]], led by Captain J.B. Harber, encountered Chief [[Buffalo Horn]] and his warriors. At South Mountain, a small mining village, they exchanged fire, resulting in the deaths of two Silver City volunteers and several Bannock, among them the chief.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 91</ref> The Bannock selected a new leader, Chief [[Egan (Paiute)|Egan]], and headed to Juniper Mountain in Idaho and Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon to meet with the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]].<ref>Madsden (1948), ''Bannock Indians in Northwest History'', p. 189</ref> Other states began sending militia troops to the region, including California, Nevada, and Utah.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 93</ref>\n\nAs the Bannock traveled westward, they continued to raid camps, resulting in some settler deaths. People in Idaho and neighboring states feared that the violence would soon spread their way.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 94</ref> Bernard arrived in Silver City on June 9 and quickly headed out to the Jordan Valley. The troops moved to meet the Bannock at Steens Mountain. Bernard's cavalry followed Chief Egan's Bannock west into Oregon, eventually meeting them in battle on June 23 by Silver Creek.<ref>Madsden (1948), ''Bannock Indians in Northwest History'', p. 190</ref> The fight resulted in the deaths of three U.S. soldiers, the wounding of three others, and an unknown number of Bannock casualties. Col. Bernard moved to nearby Camp Curry to meet with General Howard on June 25.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 125</ref>\n\nOn June 29, there was a skirmish between the Bannock warriors and Crescent City volunteer militia.

The Bannock totaled about 600 to 800 in 1870--this being due to other Soshonean peoples being included with Bannock numbers<ref>Ruby, Robert H., and John Arthur Brown (1992). \u201cBannock.\u201d In ''A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest''.

After his death, Chief [[Egan (Paiute)|Egan]] led the Bannocks. He and some of his warriors were killed in July, by a [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] party who entered his camp in [[Deception|subterfuge]].\n\nThe U.S. military, consisting of the 21st Infantry Regiment and volunteers, was led by Brigadier General [[Oliver O. Howard]]. Nearby states also sent militias to the region. The conflict ended in August and September 1878, when the remaining scattered Bannock-Paiute forces surrendered; many returned to [[Fort Hall Reservation]]. The US Army forced some 543 Paiute, from Nevada and Oregon, and Bannock prisoners to be interned at [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] in southeastern [[Washington Territory]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe Bannock people had developed as a distinct group from the Northern Paiute nation of northern Idaho. During the 18th century, these Paiute had traveled south to the [[Snake River]] plain of present-day Idaho, attracted by the prospect of an alliance with the linguistically similar and equestrian [[Shoshone people]]. It was during this period that these Paiute became known as Bannock. The Bannocks quickly adopted the Shoshone's equestrian culture and made other ties through intermarriage with the Shoshone. The Bannock provided increased security and population for the Shoshone, who had lost many members due to epidemics of infectious disease contracted from Europeans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heaton|first=John W.|title=The Shoshone-Bannocks : Culture & Commerce at Fort Hall, 1870\u20131940|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence|isbn=0700614028|pages=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Arrival of European Americans ===\nBy the time the American [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] arrived in this area of present-day southern Idaho in 1805, the Bannock-Shoshone had been trading for some time with representatives of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[North West Company]] from British Canada. They quickly opened trade with Americans for firearms and horses, as they had done with other European traders for years. The Shoshone-Bannock remained independent, despite their continued reliance on American trade. They participated in the Rocky Mountain [[fur trade]], which ended about 1840.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 32\u201333</ref> This era of positive cooperation with American trade declined in the 1850s, along with the fur trade, under pressure of increased migration of Euro-Americans to the Snake Valley plain. The discovery of gold in the Boise Basin and the Beaverhead country of Montana had attracted prospectors and traders, who moved through the Snake region, competing for game and water resources as they traveled. The American traders and migrants were an established presence in the Snake region by the mid-1860s, affecting a vast majority of the Shoshone-Bannock inhabitants.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 37</ref>\n[[File:SRPncw.jpg|thumbnail|right|Snake River Plain]]\n\nThe Shoshone-Bannock were dramatically influenced by arrival of Euroamericans and the rapid expansion of the trade-based economy. On a cultural level, the Euroamericans' way of life challenged the values and seasonal traditions of the Shoshone-Bannock. New practices of agriculture, managing livestock, and production replaced the traditional resources on which the Shoshone-Bannocks had relied. They became more dependent on Euroamerican methods and products.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nAmerican leaders were eager to acquire lands from the Shoshone-Bannock and in the 1860s, began to work to trade goods for titles to the Snake River Plains. The land trade attracted new waves of migrants to the Idaho territory, especially in the [[Boise]] region of the Snake Valley. In 1866, in order to protect the Shoshone-Bannock groups in the Boise Snake Valley from fearful and aggressive settlers, Governor [[Lyon]] created a refugee camp for a few hundred of the Bannock near Boise City. The camp's lack of sufficient resources forced the Shoshone-Bannock to depend on the local settlers for work and food. Many Shoshone-Bannock asked to be given the security of their own reservation land.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 41</ref>\n\nThe proposed relocation to eastern Idaho challenged the Shoshone-Bannock cosmology and their religious connection to the land, as their cultural practices were based in local seasonal changes in the Snake Valley. They believed their ancestors' spirits still resided in the land.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 43</ref> Leadership among the Shoshone-Bannock was believed to be directly connected to the land which these ancestors inhabited, granting the chief his position. After complex and controversial deliberation, the Shoshone-Bannock leaders and American government officials formally agreed to relocate the Boise refugees to the Fort Hall Reservation. They completed relocation in 1869.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 45</ref>\n\n===Life at Fort Hall===\nThe [[Fort Hall Reservation]] was a 1.8 million-acre plot along the Upper [[Snake River]] in eastern Idaho, on the river's southeastern banks. The region had potential for irrigation and agriculture, but the Shoshone-Bannock faced immediate survival challenges due to their dependence on native foods and buffalo found off-reservation, and the government's encouragement for them to abandon this practice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Robin|last2=Ruby|first2=Robert H.|last3=Brown|first3=John A.|date=1988|title=A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest|journal=American Indian Quarterly|volume=12|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.2307/1183804|issn=0095-182X|jstor=1183804}}</ref> The population was very dense for the land, numbering 1,037 in 1872. The Shoshone-Bannock struggled to live by subsistence.\n\nWhile the government made sizable appropriations to purchase the supplies necessary to feed the community, food crises arose during the winters of 1874\u20131875 and 1876\u20131877, resulting from diminished game for hunters and a lack of adequate food supplies by the government. Many Shoshone-Bannock left Fort Hall to attempt survival on their own.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 48\u201349</ref> Simultaneously, the 1877 [[Nez Perce War]] drove officials to crack down on the nation and require them to stay within the reservation boundaries.\n\nThe Bannock War of 1878 resulted from numerous factors.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' p. 50</ref> The terrible conditions caused divisions within the Shoshone-Bannock communities. The Bannock began to view the Shoshone as intruders and committed theft and other crimes against the group. Friction between the Native Americans and the Euroamericans increased as well, resulting in violence when Pe-tope, a Fort Hill Native American, shot and wounded two teamsters in August 1877. Agent William Danilson, the government-appointed agent of the Fort Hall reservation at the time, pressed the tribal leaders to charge Pe-tope for the crime. In response to the crackdown, a friend of Pe-tope, ''Nampe-yo-go,'' killed Alexander Rhodan, a beef contractor for the reservation.<ref>Heaton (2005), ''The Shoshone-Bannocks,'' pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\nAgent Danilson asked the nation to capture the killer and turn him over to the US officials, but he was resisted by the Shoshone-Bannock. According to their tradition of reconciliation, they said it was the duty of the family of Nampe-yo-go to resolve his crime, not the nation. That summer, a large number of the Shoshone-Bannock left the reservation, because of the lack of supplies, violence between the Native Americans and the Euroamericans, conflicts between the nations, and Danilson's actions. This sparked the Bannock War of 1878, as the US government ordered the Army to return the people to the reservation to control them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heaton|first=John W.|title=The Shoshone-Bannocks : culture & commerce at Fort Hall, 1870\u20131940|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence|isbn=0700614028|pages=51}}</ref>\n\n== The battles ==\n\n=== Camas Prairie===\nIn May 1878, Chief Buffalo assembled 200 Bannock warriors from Fort Hall at Payne's Ferry on the Snake River, moving to the Big Camas Prairie to set up camp. At that time the region between the Big Camas Prairie and the Snake River was occupied by a few white settlers, 2500 cattle, and 80 horses.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brimlow|first=George Brimlow|title=The Bannock Indian War of 1878|year=1938|publisher=The Caxton Printers Ltd|location=Caldwell, Idaho|page=74}}</ref> On May 30 the Bannock group, after trying to sell a buffalo skin robe to cowboys on the plain, shot two in an altercation. Lou Kensler and George Nesby survived their wounds and traveled with the third member of their party, William Silvey, to the nearby Baker's camp.<!--Need explanation - is Baker a family? an official group?--><ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 75</ref> Not long after this incident, the Bannock at a camp near the Lava Beds were attacked by white men. They killed a settler in the conflict but lost their camp's resources.\n\nThe news of the increased violence spread to Idaho's state capital in Boise City. Governor [[Brayman]] notified Brigadier General [[O. O. Howard]], commander of the Military Department of the Columbia. Brayman wrote in a May 30 letter that he had dispatched Col. Bernard's cavalry from Boise to the plains that evening as a show of force; he did not want to provoke further conflict.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 80</ref> Bernard's cavalry reached the Bannock camp on June 2 and drove them to retreat to the Lava Beds. The military noted this was better for defense.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 81</ref> The Bannock group moved west and raided Glenn's Ferry and King Hill station, both on the Snake River. Next, they moved along the river, killing several settlers along the way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Brigham D|title=The Bannock Indians in Northwest History|year=1948|publisher=University of California|location=California|page=187}}</ref> Bernard's cavalry traveled by road to Rattlesnake station, where they joined with more military cavalry, as well as local [[militia]] volunteers from Alturas.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 82</ref> At this time, Bernard claimed there were 300 Bannock warriors in the Lava Beds, plus 200 who had raided Glenn's Ferry and King Hill Station. The Bannock were rushing westward to meet with their [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] allies, who were traveling down the [[Owyhee River]] to the [[Juniper Mountains]] and Lava Canyon.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 88</ref>\n\n=== Conflicts between Army and Bannock ===\nOn June 8 a group of 26 volunteer military men from [[Silver City, Idaho]], led by Captain J.B. Harber, encountered Chief [[Buffalo Horn]] and his warriors. At South Mountain, a small mining village, they exchanged fire, resulting in the deaths of two Silver City volunteers and several Bannock, among them the chief.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 91</ref> The Bannock selected a new leader, Chief [[Egan (Paiute)|Egan]], and headed to Juniper Mountain in Idaho and Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon to meet with the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]].<ref>Madsden (1948), ''Bannock Indians in Northwest History'', p. 189</ref> Other states began sending militia troops to the region, including California, Nevada, and Utah.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 93</ref>\n\nAs the Bannock traveled westward, they continued to raid camps, resulting in some settler deaths. People in Idaho and neighboring states feared that the violence would soon spread their way.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 94</ref> Bernard arrived in Silver City on June 9 and quickly headed out to the Jordan Valley. The troops moved to meet the Bannock at Steens Mountain. Bernard's cavalry followed Chief Egan's Bannock west into Oregon, eventually meeting them in battle on June 23 by Silver Creek.<ref>Madsden (1948), ''Bannock Indians in Northwest History'', p. 190</ref> The fight resulted in the deaths of three U.S. soldiers, the wounding of three others, and an unknown number of Bannock casualties. Col. Bernard moved to nearby Camp Curry to meet with General Howard on June 25.<ref>Brimlow (1938), ''Bannock Indian War of 1878,'' p. 125</ref>\n\nOn June 29, there was a skirmish between the Bannock warriors and Crescent City volunteer militia. Bernard and his cavalry of 350 arrived shortly after and secured the city. The Bannock were traveling toward Fox Valley, estimated to number between 350 and 400.

Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]], and his father was the Member of Parliament for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 1910 until his death on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1917. Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and, briefly, the universities of [[Munich University|Munich]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.\n\nWhile working for Britain's [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning [[Operation Goldeneye]] and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, [[30 Assault Unit]] and [[T-Force]]. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond novels]].\n\nFleming wrote his first Bond novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolve around [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. The Bond stories rank among [[List of best-selling books#At least 100 million copies|the best-selling series of fictional books]] of all time, having sold over 100&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story ''[[Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang]]'' and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' ranked Fleming 14th on its list of \"The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945\".\n\nFleming was married to [[Ann Fleming|Ann Charteris]], who was divorced from the second [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|Viscount Rothermere]] because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has [[James Bond filmography|appeared in film]] twenty-six times, portrayed by seven actors.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Birth and family ===\n[[File:A link to James Bond - geograph.org.uk - 1255756.jpg|thumb|right|alt=a discoloured brass plaque showing the names of those local men killed in the First World War|The [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] War Memorial, listing [[Valentine Fleming]]]]\nIan<!-- Don't remove his first name: it's the first use outside the lead, so the full name is shown --> Lancaster Fleming was born on 28&nbsp;May 1908, at 27&nbsp;[[Green Street, Mayfair|Green Street]] in the wealthy London district of [[Mayfair]].<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" /><ref>{{cite book |publisher=General Register Office |location=United Kingdom |title=England and Wales Civil Registration Indexes |date=1837\u20131915 |volume=1a |page=420a}}</ref> His mother was [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming|Evelyn]] (''{{nee}}'' Rose), and his father was [[Valentine Fleming]], the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 1910 to 1917.<ref name=\"Churchill Obit\" /> As an infant he briefly lived, with his family, at [[Braziers Park]] in Oxfordshire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.braziers.org.uk/buildings-and-land |title=Buildings and Land |series=Braziers Park |access-date=23 March 2017}}</ref> Fleming was a grandson of the Scottish financier [[Robert Fleming (financier)|Robert Fleming]], who co-founded the [[Scottish American Investment Company]] and the merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]]<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" />{{efn|Since 2000 Robert Fleming & Co has been part of [[JP Morgan Chase]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Griffiths|first=Katherine|title=Abbey buys Fleming Premier for \u00a3106m |newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=15 May 2001|page=18|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1914, with the start of the First World War, [[Valentine Fleming]] joined [[Squadron (army)|\"C\" Squadron]], [[Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars]], and rose to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]].<ref name=\"Churchill Obit\" /> He was killed by German shelling on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on 20&nbsp;May 1917; [[Winston Churchill]] wrote an obituary that appeared in ''[[The Times]]''.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=12}} Because the family owned an estate at [[Arnisdale]], Valentine's death was commemorated on the [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] War Memorial.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=13}}\n\nFleming's elder brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]] (1907\u20131971) became a travel writer and married actress [[Celia Johnson]].<ref name=\"PF Obit (1971)\" /> Peter served with the [[Grenadier Guards]] during the Second World War, was later commissioned under [[Colin Gubbins]] to help establish the [[Auxiliary Units]], and became involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.<ref name=\"PF Obit (1971)\" />\n\nFleming also had two younger brothers, Michael (1913\u20131940) and Richard (1911\u20131977), and a younger maternal half-sister born out of wedlock, the cellist [[Amaryllis Fleming]] (1925\u20131999), whose father was the artist [[Augustus John]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Fergus |title=Amaryllis Fleming |department=Obiturary |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-amaryllis-fleming-1110720.html |accessdate=4 December 2011 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=5 August 1999 |location=London}}</ref> Amaryllis was conceived during a long-term affair between John and Evelyn that started in 1923, six years after the death of Valentine.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=19}}\n\n=== Education and early life ===\nIn 1914 Fleming attended [[Durnford School]], a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] on the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in [[Dorset]].{{sfn|DelFattore|1989|p=86}}{{efn|The school was near to the estate of the Bond family, who could trace their ancestry to an Elizabethan spy named John Bond, and whose motto was ''Non Sufficit Orbis''\u2014the world is not enough.<ref>{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|title=Ian Fleming 'used 16th century spy as inspiration for James Bond'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3285886/Ian-Fleming-used-16th-century-spy-as-inspiration-for-James-Bond.html|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 October 2008|location=London}}</ref>}} He did not enjoy his time at Durnford; he suffered unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}}\n[[File:Eton College quadrangle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A building in the Tudor style with a courtyard in front|[[Eton College]]: Fleming's ''alma mater'' from 1921 to 1927]]\nIn 1921 Fleming enrolled at [[Eton College]].

Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming\", according to historian [[Ben Macintyre]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=6}} It was called the [[Trout Memo]] and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to [[fly fishing]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=6}} The memo contained several schemes to be considered for use against the [[Axis powers]] to lure [[U-boats]] and German surface ships towards minefields.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=29}} Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to [[Operation Mincemeat]], the 1943 plan to conceal the [[operation Husky|intended invasion of Italy]] from North Africa, which was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942.{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}} The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: \"A Suggestion (not a very nice one)\",{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}} and continued: \"The following suggestion is used in a book by [[Basil Thomson]]: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed.

The idea was to \"obtain\" a Nazi bomber, man it with a German-speaking crew dressed in Luftwaffe uniforms, and crash it into the English Channel. The crew would then attack their German rescuers and bring their boat and [[Enigma machine]] back to England.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=121}} Much to the annoyance of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Peter Twinn]] at [[Bletchley Park]], the mission was never carried out. According to Fleming's niece, [[Lucy Fleming|Lucy]], an official of the [[Royal Air Force]] pointed out that if they were to drop a downed [[Heinkel]] bomber in the English Channel, it would probably sink rather quickly.<ref name=\"Correspondence\" />\n\nFleming also worked with Colonel [[William Joseph Donovan|\"Wild Bill\" Donovan]], President [[Franklin D.

Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], an expert on [[Caribbean]] birds and author of the definitive field guide ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, himself a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]],<ref name=\"Bond obit\" /> had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, \"that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=46}} In a 1962 interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he further explained: \"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\"<ref name=\"Hellman (1962)\" />\n\n[[File:Fleming007impression.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration commissioned by Fleming, showing his concept of the [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] character.]]\nFleming based his creation on individuals he met during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division, and admitted that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" /> Among those types were his brother Peter, whom he worshipped,<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" /> and who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.<ref name=\"PF Obit (1971)\" /> Fleming envisaged that Bond would resemble the composer, singer and actor [[Hoagy Carmichael]]; others, such as author and historian [[Ben Macintyre]], identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=35}} General references in the novels describe Bond as having \"dark, rather cruel good looks\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=62}}\n\nFleming also modelled aspects of Bond on [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], a spy whom Fleming had met while skiing in Kitzb\u00fchel in the 1930s, [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]], who served with distinction in 30AU during the war, and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale]], station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" />{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=68\u201369}} [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy Maclean]] was another possible model for Bond, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the [[Balkans]], as was the MI6 [[double agent]] [[Du\u0161ko Popov]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=54}} Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including the same golf handicap, his taste for scrambled eggs, his love of gambling, and use of the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" />\n\nAfter the publication of ''Casino Royale'', Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story.<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" /> Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'') posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} The plot of [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|''From Russia, with Love'']] uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had its roots in the wartime German Enigma machine.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} The novel's plot device of spies on the [[Orient Express]] was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attach\u00e9 and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]].

The Kuwaiti Government disapproved of the typescript, ''State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait'', and it was never published. According to Fleming: \"The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval.

The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, [[Kevin McClory]], and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}} In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter [[Jack Whittingham]] to the newly formed team,{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=374}} and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}} He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, back out of the deal, or file a suit in court.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}}\n\nWorking at Goldeneye between January and March 1960, Fleming wrote the novel ''Thunderball'', based on the screenplay written by himself, Whittingham and McClory.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=20}} In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy, and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London for an injunction to stop publication.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} After [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|two court actions]], the second in November 1961,<ref name=\"Sellers (2007)\" /> Fleming offered McClory a deal, settling out of court.

Furthermore, in Britain foreign villains used foreign servants and employees&nbsp;... This racism reflected not only a pronounced theme of interwar adventure writing, such as the novels of Buchan, but also wider literary culture.\"{{sfn|Black|2005|p=19}} Writer [[Louise Welsh]] found that the novel ''Live and Let Die'' \"taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling\" as the [[civil rights movement]]s challenged prejudice and inequality.{{sfn|Fleming|Welsh|2006|p=v}}\n\nFleming used well-known brand names and everyday details to support a sense of realism.{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} Kingsley Amis called this \"the Fleming effect\",{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} describing it as \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&nbsp;... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\"{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n=== Major themes ===\n\n==== Britain's position in the world ====\nThe Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=3}} As the series progressed, the [[British Empire]] was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that \"Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight.\"<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in ''From Russia, with Love'', it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, \"we don't show teeth any more\u2014only gums.\"{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=227}}{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}} The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel ''You Only Live Twice'', in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, [[Tiger Tanaka]]. Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]], when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}\n\nBlack points to the defections of [[Cambridge Five|four members of MI6]] to the [[Soviet Union]] as having a major impact on how Britain was viewed in US intelligence circles.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=61}} The last of the defections was that of [[Kim Philby]] in January 1963,<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Clive|first=Nigel|title=Philby, Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) (1912\u20131988)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40699|accessdate=25 October 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40699|year=2004}} </ref> while Fleming was still writing the first draft of ''You Only Live Twice''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} The briefing between Bond and M is the first time in the twelve books that Fleming acknowledges the defections.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=200}} Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the [[Profumo affair]] of 1963 as a backdrop.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}} Two of the defections had taken place shortly before Fleming wrote ''Casino Royale'',<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Kerr|first=Sheila|title=Burgess, Guy Francis de Moncy (1911\u20131963)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/37244|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37244|accessdate=20 September 2011|year=2004}} </ref> and the book can be seen as the writer's \"attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]]\", according to Lycett.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}}\n\nBy the end of the series, in the 1965 novel, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Black notes that an independent inquiry was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary, while the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting \"under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID\": this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, further underlining the decline of the British Empire.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The decline was also reflected in Bond's use of US equipment and personnel in several novels.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=53\u201354}} Uncertain and shifting geopolitics led Fleming to replace the Russian organisation SMERSH with the international terrorist group SPECTRE in ''Thunderball'', permitting \"evil unconstrained by ideology\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=50}} Black argues that SPECTRE provides a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=49}}\n\n==== Effects of the war ====\nA theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} ''The Times'' journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\",{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=85\u201386}} at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed.<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters:{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=59}} in [[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], the villain, Hammerstein, is a former [[Gestapo]] officer, while the sympathetic [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]].{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}} Similarly, in ''Moonraker'', Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\",{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}} In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\"{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=x}}\n\n==== Comradeship ====\nPeriodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies \"add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=87}} In ''Live and Let Die'', agents Quarrel and [[Felix Leiter|Leiter]] represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in  Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that \"the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=96}} In ''Dr. No'', Quarrel is \"an indispensable ally\".{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=67}} Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=112}} and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=110}}\n\n==== The \"traitor within\" ====\nFrom the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong. Bond's target in ''Casino Royale'', [[Le Chiffre]], was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=5}} especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}} The \"traitor within\" theme continued in ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Moonraker''.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=16}}\n\n==== Good versus evil ====\nRaymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} This crystallised in ''Goldfinger'' with the [[Saint George]] motif, which is stated explicitly in the book:{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} \"Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something\";{{sfn|Fleming|2006|loc=ch 18}} Black notes that the image of St. George is an English, rather than British personification.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=39}}\n\n==== Anglo-American relations ====\nThe Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=6}} In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating \"an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] observed that \"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\".<ref name=\"Hitchens (2006)\" /> Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in ''[[The James Bond Dossier]]'', pointed out that \"Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization&nbsp;... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=90}}\n\nFor three of the novels, ''Goldfinger'', ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Dr. No'', it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem,{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=38\u201339}} and Black points out that although it is American assets that are under threat in ''Dr. No'', a British agent and a British warship, HMS ''Narvik'', are sent with British soldiers to the island at the end of the novel to settle the matter.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=33}} Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel ''You Only Live Twice'' reflect this;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=187}} Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America\u2014in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Ian-Fleming-bronze-bust-by-sculptor-Anthony-Smith.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Fleming by sculptor [[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith]], commissioned by the Fleming family in 2008 to commemorate the [[centenary]] of the author's birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commissions|url=http://anthonysmithart.co.uk/?page_id=31|website=Anthony Smith Sculpture|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the late 1950s the author [[Geoffrey Jenkins]] had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential.<ref name=\"KKBB: PFO\" /> After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] to write a [[continuation novel|continuation]] Bond novel, ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'', but it was never published.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2000|p=433}} Starting with Kingsley Amis's ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', under the pseudonym \"[[Robert Markham]]\" in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|title=Colonel Sun|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/the-books/colonel-sun/|work=The Books|publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including [[Sebastian Faulks]], who was asked by [[Ian Fleming Publications]] to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Faulks pens new James Bond novel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6289186.stm|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime Fleming sold thirty million books; double that number were sold in the two years following his death.<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" /> In 2008 ''The Times'' ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Macintyre|title=14.

English author, journalist and [[Naval Intelligence Division|naval intelligence officer]] who is best known for his [[James Bond]] series of [[spy novel]]s. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]], and his father was the Member of Parliament for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 1910 until his death on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1917. Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and, briefly, the universities of [[Munich University|Munich]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.\n\nWhile working for Britain's [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning [[Operation Goldeneye]] and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, [[30 Assault Unit]] and [[T-Force]]. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|James Bond novels]].\n\nFleming wrote his first Bond novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolve around [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]]. The Bond stories rank among [[List of best-selling books#At least 100 million copies|the best-selling series of fictional books]] of all time, having sold over 100&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story ''[[Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang]]'' and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' ranked Fleming 14th on its list of \"The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945\".\n\nFleming was married to [[Ann Fleming|Ann Charteris]], who was divorced from the second [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|Viscount Rothermere]] because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels.

Fleming, himself a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]],<ref name=\"Bond obit\" /> had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, \"that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=46}} In a 1962 interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he further explained: \"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\"<ref name=\"Hellman (1962)\" />\n\n[[File:Fleming007impression.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration commissioned by Fleming, showing his concept of the [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] character.]]\nFleming based his creation on individuals he met during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division, and admitted that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" /> Among those types were his brother Peter, whom he worshipped,<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" /> and who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.<ref name=\"PF Obit (1971)\" /> Fleming envisaged that Bond would resemble the composer, singer and actor [[Hoagy Carmichael]]; others, such as author and historian [[Ben Macintyre]], identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=35}} General references in the novels describe Bond as having \"dark, rather cruel good looks\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=62}}\n\nFleming also modelled aspects of Bond on [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], a spy whom Fleming had met while skiing in Kitzb\u00fchel in the 1930s, [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]], who served with distinction in 30AU during the war, and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale]], station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].<ref name=\" Macintyre (2008)\" />{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=68\u201369}} [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy Maclean]] was another possible model for Bond, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the [[Balkans]], as was the MI6 [[double agent]] [[Du\u0161ko Popov]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=54}} Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including the same golf handicap, his taste for scrambled eggs, his love of gambling, and use of the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" />\n\nAfter the publication of ''Casino Royale'', Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story.<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" /> Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'') posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} The plot of [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|''From Russia, with Love'']] uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had its roots in the wartime German Enigma machine.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} The novel's plot device of spies on the [[Orient Express]] was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attach\u00e9 and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]].

In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.\"<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> [[Umberto Eco]] considered [[Mickey Spillane]] to have been another major influence.{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=34}}\n\nIn May 1963 Fleming wrote a piece for ''Books and Bookmen'' magazine in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: \"I write for about three hours in the morning&nbsp;... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening.

By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\"{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} Benson identified what he described as the \"Fleming Sweep\", the use of \"hooks\" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} The hooks combine with what [[Anthony Burgess]] calls \"a heightened journalistic style\"{{sfn|Burgess|1984|p=74}} to produce \"a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery\".{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=318}}\n\nUmberto Eco analysed Fleming's works from a [[Structuralism|Structuralist]] point of view,{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=3}} and identified a series of oppositions within the storylines that provide structure and narrative, including:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Bond\u2014M\n* Bond\u2014Villain\n* Villain\u2014Woman\n* Woman\u2014Bond\n* Free World\u2014Soviet Union\n* Great Britain\u2014Non-Anglo-Saxon Countries\n* Duty\u2014Sacrifice\n{{col-break}}\n* Cupidity\u2014Ideals\n* Love\u2014Death\n* Chance\u2014Planning\n* Luxury\u2014Discomfort\n* Excess\u2014Moderation\n* Perversion\u2014Innocence\n* Loyalty\u2014Dishonour{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=36}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nEco also noted that the Bond villains tend to come from Central Europe or from Slavic or Mediterranean countries and have a mixed heritage and \"complex and obscure origins\".{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=40}} Eco found that the villains were generally asexual or homosexual, inventive, organisationally astute, and wealthy.{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=40}} Black observed the same point: \"Fleming did not use class enemies for his villains instead relying on physical distortion or ethnic identity&nbsp;... Furthermore, in Britain foreign villains used foreign servants and employees&nbsp;... This racism reflected not only a pronounced theme of interwar adventure writing, such as the novels of Buchan, but also wider literary culture.\"{{sfn|Black|2005|p=19}} Writer [[Louise Welsh]] found that the novel ''Live and Let Die'' \"taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling\" as the [[civil rights movement]]s challenged prejudice and inequality.{{sfn|Fleming|Welsh|2006|p=v}}\n\nFleming used well-known brand names and everyday details to support a sense of realism.{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} Kingsley Amis called this \"the Fleming effect\",{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} describing it as \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&nbsp;...

Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]], when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}\n\nBlack points to the defections of [[Cambridge Five|four members of MI6]] to the [[Soviet Union]] as having a major impact on how Britain was viewed in US intelligence circles.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=61}} The last of the defections was that of [[Kim Philby]] in January 1963,<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Clive|first=Nigel|title=Philby, Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) (1912\u20131988)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40699|accessdate=25 October 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40699|year=2004}} </ref> while Fleming was still writing the first draft of ''You Only Live Twice''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} The briefing between Bond and M is the first time in the twelve books that Fleming acknowledges the defections.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=200}} Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the [[Profumo affair]] of 1963 as a backdrop.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}} Two of the defections had taken place shortly before Fleming wrote ''Casino Royale'',<ref>{{cite ODNB|last=Kerr|first=Sheila|title=Burgess, Guy Francis de Moncy (1911\u20131963)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/37244|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37244|accessdate=20 September 2011|year=2004}} </ref> and the book can be seen as the writer's \"attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]]\", according to Lycett.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}}\n\nBy the end of the series, in the 1965 novel, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Black notes that an independent inquiry was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary, while the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting \"under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID\": this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, further underlining the decline of the British Empire.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The decline was also reflected in Bond's use of US equipment and personnel in several novels.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=53\u201354}} Uncertain and shifting geopolitics led Fleming to replace the Russian organisation SMERSH with the international terrorist group SPECTRE in ''Thunderball'', permitting \"evil unconstrained by ideology\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=50}} Black argues that SPECTRE provides a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=49}}\n\n==== Effects of the war ====\nA theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} ''The Times'' journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\",{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=85\u201386}} at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed.<ref name=\"Cook (2004)\" /> Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters:{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=59}} in [[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], the villain, Hammerstein, is a former [[Gestapo]] officer, while the sympathetic [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]].{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}} Similarly, in ''Moonraker'', Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\",{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}} In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\"{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=x}}\n\n==== Comradeship ====\nPeriodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies \"add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=87}} In ''Live and Let Die'', agents Quarrel and [[Felix Leiter|Leiter]] represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in  Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that \"the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job\".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=96}} In ''Dr. No'', Quarrel is \"an indispensable ally\".{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=67}} Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=112}} and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=110}}\n\n==== The \"traitor within\" ====\nFrom the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong. Bond's target in ''Casino Royale'', [[Le Chiffre]], was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=5}} especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}} The \"traitor within\" theme continued in ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Moonraker''.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=16}}\n\n==== Good versus evil ====\nRaymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} This crystallised in ''Goldfinger'' with the [[Saint George]] motif, which is stated explicitly in the book:{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} \"Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something\";{{sfn|Fleming|2006|loc=ch 18}} Black notes that the image of St. George is an English, rather than British personification.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=39}}\n\n==== Anglo-American relations ====\nThe Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=6}} In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating \"an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] observed that \"the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans\".<ref name=\"Hitchens (2006)\" /> Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in ''[[The James Bond Dossier]]'', pointed out that \"Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization&nbsp;... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he\".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=90}}\n\nFor three of the novels, ''Goldfinger'', ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Dr. No'', it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem,{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=38\u201339}} and Black points out that although it is American assets that are under threat in ''Dr. No'', a British agent and a British warship, HMS ''Narvik'', are sent with British soldiers to the island at the end of the novel to settle the matter.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=33}} Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel ''You Only Live Twice'' reflect this;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=187}} Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America\u2014in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Ian-Fleming-bronze-bust-by-sculptor-Anthony-Smith.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Fleming by sculptor [[Anthony Smith (sculptor)|Anthony Smith]], commissioned by the Fleming family in 2008 to commemorate the [[centenary]] of the author's birth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commissions|url=http://anthonysmithart.co.uk/?page_id=31|website=Anthony Smith Sculpture|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the late 1950s the author [[Geoffrey Jenkins]] had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential.<ref name=\"KKBB: PFO\" /> After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] to write a [[continuation novel|continuation]] Bond novel, ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'', but it was never published.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2000|p=433}} Starting with Kingsley Amis's ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', under the pseudonym \"[[Robert Markham]]\" in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|title=Colonel Sun|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/the-books/colonel-sun/|work=The Books|publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including [[Sebastian Faulks]], who was asked by [[Ian Fleming Publications]] to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title=Faulks pens new James Bond novel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6289186.stm|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring his lifetime Fleming sold thirty million books; double that number were sold in the two years following his death.<ref name=\"Lycett (DNB)\" /> In 2008 ''The Times'' ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Macintyre|title=14.

{"title_page": "Banat Swabians", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\nThe '''Banat Swabians''' are an [[Germans|ethnic German]] population in [[Central Europe|Central]]-[[Southeast Europe]], part of the [[Danube Swabians]].\n\nThey emigrated in the 18th century to what was then the Austrian Empire's [[Banat of Temeswar]] province, later included in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]], a province which had been left sparsely populated by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|wars with Turkey]]. At the end of World War I in 1918, the Swabian minority worked to establish an independent multi-ethnic [[Banat Republic]]; however, the province was divided by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920. The greater part was annexed by [[Romania]], a smaller part by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (since 1929 [[Yugoslavia]]) and a small region around [[Szeged]] remained part of [[Hungary]].\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] most Banat Swabians were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled to the West]] by the Soviet Union and its subsidiaries, and after 1990 and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] and its republics many of those remaining left for economic and emotional reasons.\n\n==Banat and the Danube Swabians==\nThe Banat colonists are often grouped with other German-speaking ethnic groups in the area under the name ''[[Danube Swabians]]''. Besides the Banat, these groups lived in nearby western [[Ba\u010dka]] in [[Vojvodina]], Serbia, in [[Swabian Turkey]] (present-day southern Hungary), in [[Slavonia]], (present-day Croatia), and in [[Satu Mare]], Romania. All of these areas were under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule, when the Crown recruited German immigrants, particularly farmers. It wanted to repopulate the lands newly recovered from Turkish occupation and to revive agriculture in an area that had been frequently overrun by war.\n\n==Origins and recruitment==\n[[Image:deutschsieben b\u00fcrgen.svg|thumb|right|250px|Traditionally German (Saxon or Swabian) territories in Banat and Transylvania]]\nImmigrants were encouraged to settle in the Banat by the Austrian emperors in the 18th century to repopulate a frontier province bordering the Turkish empire, and to add an ethnic European Christians to the population of the newly occupied region. The Germans were offered free land and the privilege of keeping their language and religion. The Crown was seeking [[Roman Catholic]] immigrants, as were the Italian and the Spanish colonists who had come to the region.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\">{{cite web|url=http://feefhs.org/BANAT/BHISTORY.HTML |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970204103909/http://www.feefhs.org/banat/bhistory.html |archivedate=4 February 1997 |df=dmy }}</ref> Most of the German settlers came from [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Franconia]], and the [[Palatinate region|Palatinate]]. A small group can be traced to [[Middle Germany]]. However, comparatively few came from the [[Swabia]]n regions of what was then known as [[Further Austria]]. It is unclear how the group came to be called the Banat ''Swabians'', but it is probably because the majority registered and embarked from the Swabian city of [[Ulm]]. They were transported on the ''Ulmer Schachteln'' (barges) down the [[Danube]] to [[Budapest]] or [[Belgrade]], whence they set off on foot for their new homes.\n\nThe colonists were generally the younger sons of poor farming families, who saw little chance of success at home. Under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], they received financial support and long-term tax relief. Many of the earliest immigrants never married, since few German women traveled among them. Craftsmen were financially encouraged, as were teachers, doctors, and other professionals. Over the decades and more, the German spoken by these colonists became separate from that developing in Germany, particularly after its unification. It became known as Donau-Swabian, an archaic form of the language.\n\nThose who came from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] maintained the French language (labelled Banat French or ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''), as well as a separate ethnic identity for several generations.<ref name=\"memoria.ro\">[http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=1641&l=fr Smaranda Vultur, De l\u2019Ouest \u00e0 l\u2019Est et de l\u2019Est \u00e0 l\u2019Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Fran\u00e7ais du Banat, Texte present\u00e9 a la conf\u00e9rence d'histoire orale \"Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines\", Paris, 2001]</ref>\n\nBeginning with 1893, because of the [[Magyarisation]] policies of the nationalistic Hungarian State, some Banat Swabians began to move to [[Bulgaria]], where they settled in the village of [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Vratsa Province]], founded earlier by [[Banat Bulgarians]]. Their number eventually exceeded 90 families. In 1929 they built a separate Roman Catholic church after disagreements with Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these German-speaking families later moved to [[Tsarev Brod]], [[Shumen Province]] along with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families who went to another Banat Bulgarian village, [[Gostilya]], [[Pleven Province]].\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943, 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were relocated to Germany as part of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.\n\n==Banat Swabians 1920-1944==\n[[Image:Banatia.png|thumb|250px|Republic of Banatia, proposed by Banatian Swabians at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1920]]\nThe collapse of the Austro-Hungarian rule and its replacement by Romanian rule over the Banat after World War I had some benefits. In the late 19th century, Hungary had undergone a period of rapid [[Magyarization]], during which it attempted to assimilate all of its minorities. Schools were required to teach only in the Hungarian language.\n\nUnder Romanian rule, Banat Swabians could have German-language schools again for the first time since 1868. Banat Swabian culture flourished.<ref>*[[Johann B\u00f6hm (historian)]], ''Die Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien und die Weimarer Republik 1919-1933,'' (Ippesheim 1993) {{ISBN|3-928389-02-5}}</ref> A German-language theatre operated in [[Timi\u0219oara]], and across Banat, German-language newspapers were established. In 1921 a cultural association called the \"Verband der Deutschen in Rumaenien\" (Union of Germans in Romania) was founded.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\"/>\n\nEconomically, however, things did not go well. The Crash of the Stock Market on [[Black Friday (1929)|Black Friday]] and the subsequent financial crises of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s hit the Banat hard. Many Swabians left to work in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United States]], never to return.\n\nAfter 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] gained some influence among the [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] of [[Eastern Europe]], including the Banat Swabians. During the [[Second World War]], many ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Romanian Army and served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. After 1943, a German-Romanian treaty allowed them to serve instead in the [[Wehrmacht]], without having to give up their Romanian citizenship. Initially, some were virtually forced to serve in the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]], fearing there would be sanctions against their families if they refused. After August 1941 Nazi Germany instituted involuntary conscription of Banat Swabians into the [[SS]]. Towards the end of the war, some Banat Swabians openly opposed the Nazis, who in retaliation publicly executed a group of them in [[Jimbolia]] ([[Jimbolia|Hatzfeld]]).\n\nBanat Swabians who served in the Prinz Eugen Division gained notoriety because of the division's war crimes against Jews and Serbs during the [[Banat (1941\u20131944)]] period. They became alienated and were distrusted by their non-Banat Swabian neighbors.\n\n==Life after 1944==\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[Kingdom of Romania]], formerly Nazi Germany's ally, joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 23 August 1944. Overnight, all Banat Swabians in Romania became regarded as potential enemies of the state. The approach of the [[Red Army]] caused a flood of refugees to flee to the safety of Hitler's Germany.\n\nBy January 1945, Romania was completely under Soviet control. Early in 1945, under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s orders, many Banat Swabians were expelled or [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II|deported]] to forced labor camps in the [[Soviet Union]], where thousands of them died. Those who remained had their land confiscated and lost ownership of their homes (partially returned during the 1950s), while those who fled also lost their citizenship. In 1951 more than a thousand Banat Swabians were [[B\u0103r\u0103gan deportations|displaced]] to the [[B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain|B\u0103r\u0103gan Steppe]] of southeast Romania, where they founded new villages. Almost all were finally allowed to return home in 1956, but some were kept interned by force until 1963.\n\nSome Swabian families from both Romanian and [[Yugoslavia]]n Banat managed to flee to Germany in the immediate postwar years. Others were helped by French Prime Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to settle in France as ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''.<ref name=\"memoria.ro\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, however, the political atmosphere relaxed. The policy of disfranchising and dispossessing alleged Nazi collaborators within the German-speaking minority ended. Banat Swabians were extended the full rights of Romanian citizenship. Nevertheless, many Banat Swabians chose to use the looser conditions to emigrate to Germany, since they no longer trusted Romania's communist government's promises. The [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who had lived in the region since the Middle Ages, made a similar decision. Even though the Swabian families of the Danube and Banat Swabians had lived there for ten generations or more, and their cultures had developed quite differently from Germany's, they no longer felt safe.\n\nIn 1965, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] came to power in Romania. At first he opened the country to the West, but by the end of the 1970s, he had become ultra-nationalistic and an opponent of all ethnic minorities. Under his rule, any Banat Swabian who chose to emigrate had to pay a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of more than a thousand [[German mark|mark]]s (depending on age and education) for a permanent emigration visa. Still, thousands of Banat Swabians left each year into the 1980s. An economic crisis of the communist state, as well as a rumor concerning a village destruction project, caused some 200,000 to flee Romania.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\"/>\n\nAfter Ceau\u0219escu's fall in 1989 and [[German Reunification]] in 1990, almost all the remaining Banat Germans in [[Romania]] left for [[Germany]]. As a consequence, the ethnic German population in Romania is greatly reduced. Some are returning, generally entrepreneurs with economic ambitions supported by the German non-returnable grants for development projects outside Germany. Some former Banat Swabians now have a renewed desire to return to their long-time home, but most had to sell their property when they left and have no home to return to.\n\nOf the 750,000 ethnic Germans who once lived in Romania, less than one-tenth of that number remain today. Only in cities with large populations is there still a functioning German cultural life, usually aided by uninterrupted Romanian State subsidies and help from ethnic Romanians. Still, the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung'' is a thriving weekly paper, and the German State Theater in [[Timi\u0219oara]] (''Deutsches Staatstheater Temeswar''), subsidized by the Romanian government, produces permanent theatre shows. In [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], there are German-language primary and secondary schools, attended mostly by Romanian students. The remaining ethnic Germans (including Banat Swabians) in Romania are represented in politics by the DFDR or ''Demokratisches Forum der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien'' ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]]).\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nWhile the Swabians from other areas of Yugoslavia escaped or were expelled, the destiny of Banat and Ba\u010dka Swabians was much less fortunate. Due to the high level of military conscription, mostly women, children and elderly people remained in the villages, and they were unwilling or unable to flee. Near the end of the war, all Swabians who were suspected of having been involved with the Nazi military administration were placed in provisional internment camps. Many were tortured, and at least 5,800 were killed. Others were used as forced labor. After Christmas in 1944, about 30,000 younger people, mostly women, were transferred to labor camps in the Soviet Union by train, escorted by communist partisans.<ref name=hec04/>\n\nIn the framework of agricultural reform, partisan families - mainly migrants from war-torn [[Bosnia]], [[Lika]] and [[Montenegro]]\u2014 took over the confiscated Swabian farms and houses. In March 1945, the surviving Swabians were [[ghetto]]ized in \"village camps\", later described as \"extermination camps\" by the survivors, where the death rate ranged as high as 50%.<ref name=hec04>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|title=The Expulsion of the German-Speaking Minority from Yugoslavia|author1=Sretenovic, Stanislav|author2=Prauser, Steffen|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=European University Institute, Florence|page=55|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100309/http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe most notorious camp was at [[Kni\u0107anin]] (formerly Rudolfsgnad), where an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 Swabians died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |title=Vojvodina Germans Seek Moral and Cultural Rehabilitation |publisher=Beta |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520012559/http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}</ref> The situation improved in 1947, when foreign humanitarian aid reached the camps, and their work routines were loosened. The camp system was closed in March 1948, with the surviving inmates being conscripted for forced labor in the army or industry. Their flight also was usually tolerated. By the end of the 1950s, about 300,000 Yugoslav Swabians had managed to emigrate to Western countries, including the United States.<ref name=hec04/>\n\nAccording to a study conducted in 1961 by the German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], later supported by German emigrant organizations, at least 7,200 Swabians were executed by the Partisans, about 2,000 deported to the Soviet Union, and roughly 48,000 died in labor camps.

Expulsion of the Swabian minority from Hungary by the communist government, dictated by Soviet Union, took place between 1945 and 1948. As a result, many have assimilated and changed their ethnicity to become [[Magyars]] in Hungary as well as in Yugoslavia and Romania.\n\n==Swabians in emigration==\nThe Banat Swabians who emigrated to Germany are generally well integrated into the society in which they live. They keep contact through cultural organisations (''Landsmannschaften'').

At the end of World War I in 1918, the Swabian minority worked to establish an independent multi-ethnic [[Banat Republic]]; however, the province was divided by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920. The greater part was annexed by [[Romania]], a smaller part by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (since 1929 [[Yugoslavia]]) and a small region around [[Szeged]] remained part of [[Hungary]].\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] most Banat Swabians were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled to the West]] by the Soviet Union and its subsidiaries, and after 1990 and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] and its republics many of those remaining left for economic and emotional reasons.\n\n==Banat and the Danube Swabians==\nThe Banat colonists are often grouped with other German-speaking ethnic groups in the area under the name ''[[Danube Swabians]]''. Besides the Banat, these groups lived in nearby western [[Ba\u010dka]] in [[Vojvodina]], Serbia, in [[Swabian Turkey]] (present-day southern Hungary), in [[Slavonia]], (present-day Croatia), and in [[Satu Mare]], Romania. All of these areas were under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule, when the Crown recruited German immigrants, particularly farmers. It wanted to repopulate the lands newly recovered from Turkish occupation and to revive agriculture in an area that had been frequently overrun by war.\n\n==Origins and recruitment==\n[[Image:deutschsieben b\u00fcrgen.svg|thumb|right|250px|Traditionally German (Saxon or Swabian) territories in Banat and Transylvania]]\nImmigrants were encouraged to settle in the Banat by the Austrian emperors in the 18th century to repopulate a frontier province bordering the Turkish empire, and to add an ethnic European Christians to the population of the newly occupied region. The Germans were offered free land and the privilege of keeping their language and religion. The Crown was seeking [[Roman Catholic]] immigrants, as were the Italian and the Spanish colonists who had come to the region.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\">{{cite web|url=http://feefhs.org/BANAT/BHISTORY.HTML |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970204103909/http://www.feefhs.org/banat/bhistory.html |archivedate=4 February 1997 |df=dmy }}</ref> Most of the German settlers came from [[Alsace-Lorraine]], [[Austria]], [[Bavaria]], [[Franconia]], and the [[Palatinate region|Palatinate]]. A small group can be traced to [[Middle Germany]]. However, comparatively few came from the [[Swabia]]n regions of what was then known as [[Further Austria]]. It is unclear how the group came to be called the Banat ''Swabians'', but it is probably because the majority registered and embarked from the Swabian city of [[Ulm]]. They were transported on the ''Ulmer Schachteln'' (barges) down the [[Danube]] to [[Budapest]] or [[Belgrade]], whence they set off on foot for their new homes.\n\nThe colonists were generally the younger sons of poor farming families, who saw little chance of success at home. Under [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], they received financial support and long-term tax relief. Many of the earliest immigrants never married, since few German women traveled among them. Craftsmen were financially encouraged, as were teachers, doctors, and other professionals. Over the decades and more, the German spoken by these colonists became separate from that developing in Germany, particularly after its unification. It became known as Donau-Swabian, an archaic form of the language.\n\nThose who came from French-speaking or linguistically mixed communes in [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] maintained the French language (labelled Banat French or ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''), as well as a separate ethnic identity for several generations.<ref name=\"memoria.ro\">[http://www.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&id=1641&l=fr Smaranda Vultur, De l\u2019Ouest \u00e0 l\u2019Est et de l\u2019Est \u00e0 l\u2019Ouest : les avatars identitaires des Fran\u00e7ais du Banat, Texte present\u00e9 a la conf\u00e9rence d'histoire orale \"Visibles mais pas nombreuses : les circulations migratoires roumaines\", Paris, 2001]</ref>\n\nBeginning with 1893, because of the [[Magyarisation]] policies of the nationalistic Hungarian State, some Banat Swabians began to move to [[Bulgaria]], where they settled in the village of [[Bardarski Geran]], [[Vratsa Province]], founded earlier by [[Banat Bulgarians]]. Their number eventually exceeded 90 families. In 1929 they built a separate Roman Catholic church after disagreements with Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these German-speaking families later moved to [[Tsarev Brod]], [[Shumen Province]] along with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families who went to another Banat Bulgarian village, [[Gostilya]], [[Pleven Province]].\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943, 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were relocated to Germany as part of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.\n\n==Banat Swabians 1920-1944==\n[[Image:Banatia.png|thumb|250px|Republic of Banatia, proposed by Banatian Swabians at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1920]]\nThe collapse of the Austro-Hungarian rule and its replacement by Romanian rule over the Banat after World War I had some benefits. In the late 19th century, Hungary had undergone a period of rapid [[Magyarization]], during which it attempted to assimilate all of its minorities. Schools were required to teach only in the Hungarian language.\n\nUnder Romanian rule, Banat Swabians could have German-language schools again for the first time since 1868. Banat Swabian culture flourished.<ref>*[[Johann B\u00f6hm (historian)]], ''Die Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien und die Weimarer Republik 1919-1933,'' (Ippesheim 1993) {{ISBN|3-928389-02-5}}</ref> A German-language theatre operated in [[Timi\u0219oara]], and across Banat, German-language newspapers were established. In 1921 a cultural association called the \"Verband der Deutschen in Rumaenien\" (Union of Germans in Romania) was founded.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\"/>\n\nEconomically, however, things did not go well. The Crash of the Stock Market on [[Black Friday (1929)|Black Friday]] and the subsequent financial crises of the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s hit the Banat hard. Many Swabians left to work in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and the [[United States]], never to return.\n\nAfter 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] gained some influence among the [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] of [[Eastern Europe]], including the Banat Swabians. During the [[Second World War]], many ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Romanian Army and served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. After 1943, a German-Romanian treaty allowed them to serve instead in the [[Wehrmacht]], without having to give up their Romanian citizenship. Initially, some were virtually forced to serve in the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]], fearing there would be sanctions against their families if they refused. After August 1941 Nazi Germany instituted involuntary conscription of Banat Swabians into the [[SS]]. Towards the end of the war, some Banat Swabians openly opposed the Nazis, who in retaliation publicly executed a group of them in [[Jimbolia]] ([[Jimbolia|Hatzfeld]]).\n\nBanat Swabians who served in the Prinz Eugen Division gained notoriety because of the division's war crimes against Jews and Serbs during the [[Banat (1941\u20131944)]] period. They became alienated and were distrusted by their non-Banat Swabian neighbors.\n\n==Life after 1944==\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[Kingdom of Romania]], formerly Nazi Germany's ally, joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 23 August 1944. Overnight, all Banat Swabians in Romania became regarded as potential enemies of the state. The approach of the [[Red Army]] caused a flood of refugees to flee to the safety of Hitler's Germany.\n\nBy January 1945, Romania was completely under Soviet control. Early in 1945, under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s orders, many Banat Swabians were expelled or [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II|deported]] to forced labor camps in the [[Soviet Union]], where thousands of them died. Those who remained had their land confiscated and lost ownership of their homes (partially returned during the 1950s), while those who fled also lost their citizenship. In 1951 more than a thousand Banat Swabians were [[B\u0103r\u0103gan deportations|displaced]] to the [[B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain|B\u0103r\u0103gan Steppe]] of southeast Romania, where they founded new villages. Almost all were finally allowed to return home in 1956, but some were kept interned by force until 1963.\n\nSome Swabian families from both Romanian and [[Yugoslavia]]n Banat managed to flee to Germany in the immediate postwar years. Others were helped by French Prime Minister [[Robert Schuman]] to settle in France as ''Fran\u00e7ais du Banat''.<ref name=\"memoria.ro\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, however, the political atmosphere relaxed. The policy of disfranchising and dispossessing alleged Nazi collaborators within the German-speaking minority ended. Banat Swabians were extended the full rights of Romanian citizenship. Nevertheless, many Banat Swabians chose to use the looser conditions to emigrate to Germany, since they no longer trusted Romania's communist government's promises. The [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who had lived in the region since the Middle Ages, made a similar decision. Even though the Swabian families of the Danube and Banat Swabians had lived there for ten generations or more, and their cultures had developed quite differently from Germany's, they no longer felt safe.\n\nIn 1965, [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] came to power in Romania. At first he opened the country to the West, but by the end of the 1970s, he had become ultra-nationalistic and an opponent of all ethnic minorities. Under his rule, any Banat Swabian who chose to emigrate had to pay a [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] of more than a thousand [[German mark|mark]]s (depending on age and education) for a permanent emigration visa. Still, thousands of Banat Swabians left each year into the 1980s. An economic crisis of the communist state, as well as a rumor concerning a village destruction project, caused some 200,000 to flee Romania.<ref name=\"feefhs.org\"/>\n\nAfter Ceau\u0219escu's fall in 1989 and [[German Reunification]] in 1990, almost all the remaining Banat Germans in [[Romania]] left for [[Germany]]. As a consequence, the ethnic German population in Romania is greatly reduced. Some are returning, generally entrepreneurs with economic ambitions supported by the German non-returnable grants for development projects outside Germany. Some former Banat Swabians now have a renewed desire to return to their long-time home, but most had to sell their property when they left and have no home to return to.\n\nOf the 750,000 ethnic Germans who once lived in Romania, less than one-tenth of that number remain today. Only in cities with large populations is there still a functioning German cultural life, usually aided by uninterrupted Romanian State subsidies and help from ethnic Romanians. Still, the ''Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung'' is a thriving weekly paper, and the German State Theater in [[Timi\u0219oara]] (''Deutsches Staatstheater Temeswar''), subsidized by the Romanian government, produces permanent theatre shows. In [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], there are German-language primary and secondary schools, attended mostly by Romanian students. The remaining ethnic Germans (including Banat Swabians) in Romania are represented in politics by the DFDR or ''Demokratisches Forum der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien'' ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]]).\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nWhile the Swabians from other areas of Yugoslavia escaped or were expelled, the destiny of Banat and Ba\u010dka Swabians was much less fortunate. Due to the high level of military conscription, mostly women, children and elderly people remained in the villages, and they were unwilling or unable to flee. Near the end of the war, all Swabians who were suspected of having been involved with the Nazi military administration were placed in provisional internment camps. Many were tortured, and at least 5,800 were killed. Others were used as forced labor. After Christmas in 1944, about 30,000 younger people, mostly women, were transferred to labor camps in the Soviet Union by train, escorted by communist partisans.<ref name=hec04/>\n\nIn the framework of agricultural reform, partisan families - mainly migrants from war-torn [[Bosnia]], [[Lika]] and [[Montenegro]]\u2014 took over the confiscated Swabian farms and houses. In March 1945, the surviving Swabians were [[ghetto]]ized in \"village camps\", later described as \"extermination camps\" by the survivors, where the death rate ranged as high as 50%.<ref name=hec04>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|title=The Expulsion of the German-Speaking Minority from Yugoslavia|author1=Sretenovic, Stanislav|author2=Prauser, Steffen|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=European University Institute, Florence|page=55|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100309/http://www.iue.it/PUB/HEC04-01.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe most notorious camp was at [[Kni\u0107anin]] (formerly Rudolfsgnad), where an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 Swabians died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |title=Vojvodina Germans Seek Moral and Cultural Rehabilitation |publisher=Beta |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520012559/http://www.media-diversity.org/beta%20articles/Vojvodina%20Germans.htm |archivedate=20 May 2009 }}</ref> The situation improved in 1947, when foreign humanitarian aid reached the camps, and their work routines were loosened. The camp system was closed in March 1948, with the surviving inmates being conscripted for forced labor in the army or industry. Their flight also was usually tolerated. By the end of the 1950s, about 300,000 Yugoslav Swabians had managed to emigrate to Western countries, including the United States.<ref name=hec04/>\n\nAccording to a study conducted in 1961 by the German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], later supported by German emigrant organizations, at least 7,200 Swabians were executed by the Partisans, about 2,000 deported to the Soviet Union, and roughly 48,000 died in labor camps.
