The organization conducted grassroots organizing efforts, educational activities and electoral campaigns.\n\nInternal divisions arose between members who saw electoral politics as ultimately corrupting and supported the notion of an \"anti-party party\" formed by [[Petra Kelly]] and other leaders of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] in [[Germany]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/28/28-18.html|title=On Morality and Human Dignity (excerpts)|accessdate=August 15, 2019|author=Kelly, Petra|journal=Synthesis/Regeneration|volume=28|year=2002}}</ref> vs. those who saw electoral strategies as a crucial engine of social change. A struggle for the direction of the organization culminated a \"compromise agreement\", ratified in 1990 at the Greens National Congress in [[Elkins, West Virginia]] and in which both strategies would be accommodated within the same [[527 organization|527 political organization]] renamed the [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (G/GPUSA). It was recognized by the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] as a national political party in 1991.\n\nThe compromise agreement subsequently collapsed and two [[Green party]] organizations have co-existed in the United States since. The Green Politics Network was organized in 1990 and the National Association of Statewide Green Parties formed by 1994. Divisions between those pressing to break onto the national political stage and those aiming to grow roots at the local level continued to widen during the 1990s. The [[Association of State Green Parties]] (ASGP) encouraged and backed Nader's presidential runs in 1996 and 2000. By 2001, the push to separate electoral activity from the G/GPUSA issue-based organizing led to the Boston Proposal and subsequent rise of the Green Party of the United States.  The G/GPUSA lost most of its affiliates in the following months and dropped its FEC national party status in 2005.\n\n== Ideology ==\n{{Green politics sidebar}}\nThe Green Party of the United States follows the ideals of [[green politics]], which are based on the Four Pillars, namely: \n# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],\n# [[Social justice]],\n# [[Grassroots democracy]], and\n# [[Nonviolence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/the_four_pillars|title=The Four Pillars|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Ten Key Values, which expand upon the Four Pillars, are as follows:<ref name=\"Key\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/ten_key_values_2016|title=Ten Key Values|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n# [[Grassroots democracy]],\n# [[Social justice]] and [[equal opportunity]],\n# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],\n# [[Nonviolence]],\n# [[Decentralization]],\n# [[Community-based economics]],\n# [[Feminism]] and [[gender equality]],\n# [[Multiculturalism|Respect for diversity]],\n# [[Social responsibility|Personal and global responsibility]], and\n# Future focus and [[sustainability]].\n\n[[Peter Camejo]] was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a [[Watermelon (politics)|watermelon]]\u2014green on the outside, but red on the inside.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2002/10/02/MN31845.DTL&o=0|title=Multimedia (image)|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 15, 2019|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115223807/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2002%2F10%2F02%2FMN31845.DTL&o=0|archivedate=November 15, 2005}}</ref> In January 2004, he initiated the Avocado Declaration, which compares Greens to avocados. \"An avocado is Green on the outside and Green on the inside\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Avocado Declaration, a statement by Peter Camejo and the Avocado Education Project|url=https://www.cagreens.org/longbeach/avocado.htm|publisher=cagreens.org|date=January 1, 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234142/https://www.cagreens.org/longbeach/avocado.htm|archive-date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The Declaration goes on to explain that Greens have a vital role in bringing [[democracy]] to the otherwise undemocratic [[Two-party system|two party system]] of the United States; that the Greens have a unique and independent identity as a [[Third parties in the United States|third party]], which cannot be subsumed into the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties; and that they cannot be dismissed by Republican or Democratic critics by implying that they are merely socialists or communists.\n\nIn 2016, the Green Party passed a motion in favor of rejecting both [[capitalism]] and [[state socialism]], and instead supporting \"alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power\".<ref name=\"Key\" /> The motion states the change that the party says could be described as promoting \"'[[ecosocialism|ecological socialism]],' '[[communalism]],' or the 'cooperative commonwealth'\".<ref name=\"Key\" />\n\nThe Green Party does not accept donations from corporations, [[political action committee]]s (PACs), [[527 organization|527(c) organization]]s or [[soft money]].

and position on Super PACs ==\nIn the early decades of Green organizing in the United States, the prevailing American system of money-dominated elections was universally rejected by Greens, so that some Greens were reluctant to have Greens participate in the election system at all because they deemed the campaign finance system inherently corrupt. Other Greens felt strongly that the Green Party should develop in the electoral arena and many of these Greens felt that adopting an alternative model of campaign finance, emphasizing self-imposed contribution limits, would present a wholesome and attractive contrast to the odious campaign finance practices of the money-dominated major parties.\n\nOver the years, some state Green parties have come to place less emphasis on the principle of self-imposed limits than they did in the past. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that Green Party fundraising (for candidates' campaigns and for the party itself) still tends to rely on relatively small contributions and that Greens generally decry not only the rise of the [[Political action committee|Super PACs]], but also the big-money system, which some Greens criticize as [[plutocracy]].\n\nSome Greens feel that the Green Party's position should be simply to follow the laws and regulations of campaign finance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garecht, Joe|url=http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|title=7 Creative Political Fundraising Ideas|publisher=Localvictory.com|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316233902/http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|archive-date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other Greens argue that it would injure the Green Party not to practice a principled stand against the anti-democratic influence of money in the political process. Candidates for office, like [[Jill Stein]], the 2012 and 2016 Green Party nominee for the President of the United States, typically rely on smaller donations to fund their campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/colleen-becker/long-shots_b_1263720.html|title=Long Shots|work=The Huffington Post|date=February 9, 2012|last=Becker|first=Colleen|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== State and territorial parties ==\n{{main|List of state Green Parties in the United States}}\nThe following is a list of accredited state parties which comprise the Green Party of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/state_parties|title=Green Party \u2013 State Parties|publisher=Green Party US|year=2015|accessdate=August 17, 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926090547/http://www.gp.org/state_parties|archivedate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Green Party of Alaska]]\n* [[Arizona Green Party]]\n* [[Green Party of Arkansas]]\n* [[Green Party of California]]\n* [[Green Party of Colorado]]\n* [[Connecticut Green Party]]\n* [[Green Party of Delaware]]\n* [[D.C.

The organization conducted grassroots organizing efforts, educational activities and electoral campaigns.\n\nInternal divisions arose between members who saw electoral politics as ultimately corrupting and supported the notion of an \"anti-party party\" formed by [[Petra Kelly]] and other leaders of the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] in [[Germany]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/28/28-18.html|title=On Morality and Human Dignity (excerpts)|accessdate=August 15, 2019|author=Kelly, Petra|journal=Synthesis/Regeneration|volume=28|year=2002}}</ref> vs. those who saw electoral strategies as a crucial engine of social change. A struggle for the direction of the organization culminated a \"compromise agreement\", ratified in 1990 at the Greens National Congress in [[Elkins, West Virginia]] and in which both strategies would be accommodated within the same [[527 organization|527 political organization]] renamed the [[Greens/Green Party USA]] (G/GPUSA). It was recognized by the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] as a national political party in 1991.\n\nThe compromise agreement subsequently collapsed and two [[Green party]] organizations have co-existed in the United States since. The Green Politics Network was organized in 1990 and the National Association of Statewide Green Parties formed by 1994. Divisions between those pressing to break onto the national political stage and those aiming to grow roots at the local level continued to widen during the 1990s. The [[Association of State Green Parties]] (ASGP) encouraged and backed Nader's presidential runs in 1996 and 2000. By 2001, the push to separate electoral activity from the G/GPUSA issue-based organizing led to the Boston Proposal and subsequent rise of the Green Party of the United States.  The G/GPUSA lost most of its affiliates in the following months and dropped its FEC national party status in 2005.\n\n== Ideology ==\n{{Green politics sidebar}}\nThe Green Party of the United States follows the ideals of [[green politics]], which are based on the Four Pillars, namely: \n# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],\n# [[Social justice]],\n# [[Grassroots democracy]], and\n# [[Nonviolence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/the_four_pillars|title=The Four Pillars|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Ten Key Values, which expand upon the Four Pillars, are as follows:<ref name=\"Key\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gp.org/ten_key_values_2016|title=Ten Key Values|publisher=Green Party US|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n# [[Grassroots democracy]],\n# [[Social justice]] and [[equal opportunity]],\n# [[Ecosophy|Ecological wisdom]],\n# [[Nonviolence]],\n# [[Decentralization]],\n# [[Community-based economics]],\n# [[Feminism]] and [[gender equality]],\n# [[Multiculturalism|Respect for diversity]],\n# [[Social responsibility|Personal and global responsibility]], and\n# Future focus and [[sustainability]].\n\n[[Peter Camejo]] was quoted in 2002 as claiming that he was a [[Watermelon (politics)|watermelon]]\u2014green on the outside, but red on the inside.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2002/10/02/MN31845.DTL&o=0|title=Multimedia (image)|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 15, 2019|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115223807/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2002%2F10%2F02%2FMN31845.DTL&o=0|archivedate=November 15, 2005}}</ref> In January 2004, he initiated the Avocado Declaration, which compares Greens to avocados. \"An avocado is Green on the outside and Green on the inside\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Avocado Declaration, a statement by Peter Camejo and the Avocado Education Project|url=https://www.cagreens.org/longbeach/avocado.htm|publisher=cagreens.org|date=January 1, 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613234142/https://www.cagreens.org/longbeach/avocado.htm|archive-date=June 13, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref> The Declaration goes on to explain that Greens have a vital role in bringing [[democracy]] to the otherwise undemocratic [[Two-party system|two party system]] of the United States; that the Greens have a unique and independent identity as a [[Third parties in the United States|third party]], which cannot be subsumed into the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties; and that they cannot be dismissed by Republican or Democratic critics by implying that they are merely socialists or communists.\n\nIn 2016, the Green Party passed a motion in favor of rejecting both [[capitalism]] and [[state socialism]], and instead supporting \"alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power\".<ref name=\"Key\" /> The motion states the change that the party says could be described as promoting \"'[[ecosocialism|ecological socialism]],' '[[communalism]],' or the 'cooperative commonwealth'\".<ref name=\"Key\" />\n\nThe Green Party does not accept donations from corporations, [[political action committee]]s (PACs), [[527 organization|527(c) organization]]s or [[soft money]].

and position on Super PACs ==\nIn the early decades of Green organizing in the United States, the prevailing American system of money-dominated elections was universally rejected by Greens, so that some Greens were reluctant to have Greens participate in the election system at all because they deemed the campaign finance system inherently corrupt. Other Greens felt strongly that the Green Party should develop in the electoral arena and many of these Greens felt that adopting an alternative model of campaign finance, emphasizing self-imposed contribution limits, would present a wholesome and attractive contrast to the odious campaign finance practices of the money-dominated major parties.\n\nOver the years, some state Green parties have come to place less emphasis on the principle of self-imposed limits than they did in the past. Nevertheless, it is safe to say that Green Party fundraising (for candidates' campaigns and for the party itself) still tends to rely on relatively small contributions and that Greens generally decry not only the rise of the [[Political action committee|Super PACs]], but also the big-money system, which some Greens criticize as [[plutocracy]].\n\nSome Greens feel that the Green Party's position should be simply to follow the laws and regulations of campaign finance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garecht, Joe|url=http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|title=7 Creative Political Fundraising Ideas|publisher=Localvictory.com|date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316233902/http://www.localvictory.com/fundraising/creative-political-fundraising-ideas.html|archive-date=March 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other Greens argue that it would injure the Green Party not to practice a principled stand against the anti-democratic influence of money in the political process.

It was formed following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1991, though the military was not created by the [[government of Uzbekistan|Uzbek government]] until 1992. The Air Force consists of 10,000 to 15,000 personnel, with most of them being [[Russian people|Russian]]s as of 1995.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n\nIn March 1994, the [[Russian Federation]] signed a treaty with Uzbekistan in training of pilots. The Uzbek Air Force is assisted by the [[Russian Air Force]], though an [[Uzbekistan Air Academy|air academy]] has been made to train Uzbeks at [[Ozizak]]. As of that year, some thirteen airbases were active in Uzbekistan. The Air Force was to follow the Soviet doctrine, supported by the [[Uzbekistan Ground Forces]].\n\nDuring the [[Tajik civil war]] in 1992, the [[Tajikistan]] [[government of Tajikistan|government]] was supported by Uzbekistan. Helicopters of the Air Force fought the [[Muslim]] rebels at a [[United Tajik Opposition]] base. Later, the Uzbek Air Force was said to have destroyed the last holdouts of rebels in eastern Tajikistan. [[Alexander Shishlyannikov]], a member of the [[Ministry of Defence (Uzbekistan)|Uzbek defense ministry]] was made the Tajik [[Ministry of Defence (Tajikistan)|Minister of Defence]].\n\nDue to an agreement in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], Russia helped maintain the aircraft of the Uzbek Air Force and sold them more aircraft at a cheaper price than to other interests, such as the [[United States]]. In [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the US government and [[NATO]] had an aviation company repair much of the Air Force's aircraft, as it was deemed inoperable by them. Russia tried to undermine US efforts to reach out to Uzbekistan, especially at a 2002 conference in [[Tashkent]], where members of various aviation companies were present.\n\nThe talks failed, and the Uzbek government had cut off the US aid in the form of helicopter repairs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/centralasia/uzbek-airforce.htm|title=Uzbekistan- Air Force|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Boeing 767-300ER Uzbekistan.jpg|thumb|Uzbekistan governmental plane [[Boeing 767-300]].]]\n[[File:Air defence and Air force and of Uzbekistan.jpg|thumb|150px|Air defence patch]]\nThe Uzbek air forces consist of units formerly part of the 49th Air Army of the [[Turkestan Military District]] headquartered at [[Tashkent]].

It was formed following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], in 1991, though the military was not created by the [[government of Uzbekistan|Uzbek government]] until 1992. The Air Force consists of 10,000 to 15,000 personnel, with most of them being [[Russian people|Russian]]s as of 1995.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n\nIn March 1994, the [[Russian Federation]] signed a treaty with Uzbekistan in training of pilots. The Uzbek Air Force is assisted by the [[Russian Air Force]], though an [[Uzbekistan Air Academy|air academy]] has been made to train Uzbeks at [[Ozizak]]. As of that year, some thirteen airbases were active in Uzbekistan. The Air Force was to follow the Soviet doctrine, supported by the [[Uzbekistan Ground Forces]].\n\nDuring the [[Tajik civil war]] in 1992, the [[Tajikistan]] [[government of Tajikistan|government]] was supported by Uzbekistan. Helicopters of the Air Force fought the [[Muslim]] rebels at a [[United Tajik Opposition]] base. Later, the Uzbek Air Force was said to have destroyed the last holdouts of rebels in eastern Tajikistan. [[Alexander Shishlyannikov]], a member of the [[Ministry of Defence (Uzbekistan)|Uzbek defense ministry]] was made the Tajik [[Ministry of Defence (Tajikistan)|Minister of Defence]].\n\nDue to an agreement in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], Russia helped maintain the aircraft of the Uzbek Air Force and sold them more aircraft at a cheaper price than to other interests, such as the [[United States]]. In [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the US government and [[NATO]] had an aviation company repair much of the Air Force's aircraft, as it was deemed inoperable by them. Russia tried to undermine US efforts to reach out to Uzbekistan, especially at a 2002 conference in [[Tashkent]], where members of various aviation companies were present.\n\nThe talks failed, and the Uzbek government had cut off the US aid in the form of helicopter repairs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/centralasia/uzbek-airforce.htm|title=Uzbekistan- Air Force|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Boeing 767-300ER Uzbekistan.jpg|thumb|Uzbekistan governmental plane [[Boeing 767-300]].]]\n[[File:Air defence and Air force and of Uzbekistan.jpg|thumb|150px|Air defence patch]]\nThe Uzbek air forces consist of units formerly part of the 49th Air Army of the [[Turkestan Military District]] headquartered at [[Tashkent]].

Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\", because of numerous local [[pretzel]] bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists.

Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, [[Sir William Penn]].\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with [[Conrad Weiser]]. Taking its name from [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western [[Germany]], who bought land from the Penns.

Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nCensus data showed that, from 1810 to 1950, Reading was among the nation's top one hundred largest urban places.\n\nThe [[Schuylkill Canal]], a north\u2013south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the [[Schuylkill River]] and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the [[Delaware River]]. The [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]], an east\u2013west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and [[Susquehanna River]]s, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the [[Long Depression]] following the [[Panic of 1873]], a [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|statewide railroad strike]] in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.<ref>Zinn, Howard.

The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ([[Conrail]]).\n\nThe [[Charles Evans Cemetery]] is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\nIn 1972, [[Hurricane Agnes]] caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the [[Schuylkill River]]. A similar, though not as devastating, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flood]] occurred during June 2006.\n\nThe 2000 census showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed to an influx of [[Hispanic]] residents from [[New York City]], as well as from the extension of [[suburban sprawl]] from [[Philadelphia]]'s northwest suburbs.\n\nReading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#METRO|title=City Crime Rankings by Population Group|work=morganquitno.com}}</ref> However, new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact.

The Reading area is considered a [[humid subtropical climate]], with areas just to the north designated as a [[humid continental climate]]. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 85&nbsp;\u00b0F. Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 15\u201320 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90&nbsp;\u00b0F. Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in mid to late October.\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38; the average January low is 22&nbsp;\u00b0F, but it is not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was \u221221&nbsp;\u00b0F during a widespread [[1994 North American cold wave|cold wave in January 1994]]. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32&nbsp;inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring. The last killing frost usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May.

Kutztown University also has a program with Reutlingen.\n\nReading is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n* {{flagdeco|DEU}} [[Reutlingen]], Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, since 1998\n* {{flagdeco|CHN}}[[Changzhi]], Shanxi, China, since 1992<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20080512080145/http://www.readingpa.gov/mayor_press_releases_1142005.asp</ref>\n|}\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania).jpg|thumb|Reading's [[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Pagoda]] seen from Skyline Drive]]\nIn 1908, a Japanese-style [[pagoda]] was built on Mount Penn, where it overlooks the city and is visible from almost everywhere in town. Locally, it is called the \"[[Pagoda (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Pagoda]]\". It is currently the home of a caf\u00e9 and a gift shop. It remains a popular tourist attraction.\n\nAnother fixture in Reading's skyline is the William Penn Memorial Fire Tower, one mile from the Pagoda on Skyline Drive. Built in 1939 for fire department and forestry observation, the tower is 120 feet tall, and rises 950 feet above the intersection of fifth and Penn Streets. From the top of the tower is a 60-mile panoramic view.\n\nThe Reading Glove and Mitten Manufacturing Company founded in 1899, just outside Reading city limits, in West Reading and Wyomissing boroughs changed its name to Vanity Fair in 1911 and is now the major clothing manufacturer [[VF Corp.]]  In the early 1970s, the original factories were developed to create the [[VF Corp.#VF Outlet Village|VF Outlet Village]], the first outlet mall in the United States.\n\n==In media==\nThe book and movie ''[[Rabbit, Run]]'' and the other three novels of the ''Rabbit'' series by [[John Updike]] were set in fictionalized versions of Reading and nearby [[Shillington, Pennsylvania|Shillington]], called [[Brewer, Pennsylvania|Brewer]] and Olinger respectively. Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was thirteen. He also makes reference to the Brewer suburb of Mount Judge, equivalent to Mount Penn, east of Reading.\n\nThe play ''[[Sweat (play)|Sweat]]'' by [[Lynn Nottage]] is set in Reading.<ref>{{Cite news |title= Review: Lynn Nottage's 'Sweat' Examines Lives Unraveling by Industry's Demise |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 2015 | author=Charles Isherwood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/theater/review-lynn-nottages-sweat-examines-lives-unraveling-by-industrys-demise.html?_r=0 |accessdate=February 2, 2016|author-link=Charles Isherwood }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title= 'Sweat' by Lynn Nottage gives voice to the 'new poor'|periodical=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 21, 2016 | author=Sadie Dingfelder|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/01/21/sweat-by-lynn-nottage-gives-voice-to-the-new-poor/|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe movie ''[[Goon: Last of the Enforcers]]'' features Reading as the home of the rival team, the Reading Wolf Dogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!--Please keep this list in alphabetical order by last name.

Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic United States version of the ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\", because of numerous local [[pretzel]] bakeries. Currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists.

Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, [[Sir William Penn]].\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn (sons of William Penn) mapped out the town of Reading with [[Conrad Weiser]]. Taking its name from [[Reading, Berkshire]], England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western [[Germany]], who bought land from the Penns.

Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\nCensus data showed that, from 1810 to 1950, Reading was among the nation's top one hundred largest urban places.\n\nThe [[Schuylkill Canal]], a north\u2013south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the [[Schuylkill River]] and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the [[Delaware River]]. The [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]], an east\u2013west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and [[Susquehanna River]]s, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\nThe [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the [[Long Depression]] following the [[Panic of 1873]], a [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|statewide railroad strike]] in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.<ref>Zinn, Howard.

The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation ([[Conrail]]).\n\nThe [[Charles Evans Cemetery]] is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s.

From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\nIn 1972, [[Hurricane Agnes]] caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the [[Schuylkill River]]. A similar, though not as devastating, [[Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006|flood]] occurred during June 2006.\n\nThe 2000 census showed that Reading's population decline had ceased. This was attributed to an influx of [[Hispanic]] residents from [[New York City]], as well as from the extension of [[suburban sprawl]] from [[Philadelphia]]'s northwest suburbs.\n\nReading has its share of obstacles to overcome, namely crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morganquitno.com/xcit06pop.htm#METRO|title=City Crime Rankings by Population Group|work=morganquitno.com}}</ref> However, new crime fighting strategies appear to have had an impact.

The Reading area is considered a [[humid subtropical climate]], with areas just to the north designated as a [[humid continental climate]]. Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 85&nbsp;\u00b0F. Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 15\u201320 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90&nbsp;\u00b0F. Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in mid to late October.\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38; the average January low is 22&nbsp;\u00b0F, but it is not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was \u221221&nbsp;\u00b0F during a widespread [[1994 North American cold wave|cold wave in January 1994]]. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32&nbsp;inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring. The last killing frost usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May.

He is a five-time World Cup overall champion.\n\n==Race career==\nAaron Gwin started his cycling career off early racing BMX from age 4, by age 8 Gwin was racing all the nationals.  At age 12 Gwin moved on to motocross and raced up until he was 17 when he quit due to constant injuries.  In 2008 at age 20 Gwin was loaned a bike by fellow professional downhill racer and good friend Cody Warren and was encouraged to compete in a race.  In his first race in the Fontana Winter Series he got 3rd and began racing from then on, quickly signing with [[Yeti Cycles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycling.com/article/0,6610,s1-6-12-18376-1,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418130332/http://www.bicycling.com/article/0%2C6610%2Cs1-6-12-18376-1%2C00.html |archivedate=2009-04-18 }}</ref>  He became well-known for breaking into the international [[UCI Mountain Bike World Cup|World Cup]] scene after only 8 months of riding downhill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bikemag.com/features/onlineexclusive/8-27-08-online-exclusive-aaron-gwinn-is-turning-heads |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108134452/http://bikemag.com/features/onlineexclusive/8-27-08-online-exclusive-aaron-gwinn-is-turning-heads |archivedate=2009-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nMany saw Gwin as the savior for US downhilling on the international scene since his 10th-place finish at the [[Mont Sainte-Anne]] [[UCI Mountain Bike World Cup|World Cup]] in 2008 was the first American top 10 finish since 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinnedmtb.com/aarongwin_interview08.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021063545/http://www.pinnedmtb.com/aarongwin_interview08.htm |archivedate=2008-10-21 }}</ref> He has since won eight United States National Championships for Downhill, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 Gwin dominated the UCI World Cup downhill series.

His racing showed recovery from his 2013 setbacks but whose runs remain notoriously plagued with, what some think, the worst luck on the circuits, such as this run in [[Leogang]] at the UCI MTB World Cup in 2014 where his tyre flatted as he left the start then came off<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkbike.com/news/video-aaron-gwins-flat-tire-flyer-world-cup-2014.html|title=Video: Aaron Gwin's Incredible Flat Tire Race Run|work=Pinkbike}}</ref> or this now famous ride from 2015 again at Leogang UCI MTB World Cup where his chain broke on the start line and he put in a text-book perfect pedal stroke-less ride holding his speed to win the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkbike.com/news/video-aaron-gwin-chainless-leogang-2015.html|title=Video: Aaron Gwin Unchained|work=Pinkbike}}</ref>\n\n==Riding style==\nMuch of Gwin's style and skill come from his motocross, and his whips and jumping technique show it.  He also gained a lot of flow from racing [[BMX]] for so many years, bringing him success in Dual Slalom and Mountain Cross.\nAaron left the Yeti team to join the Trek World Racing Team in November 2010 after relocating to Temecula, CA. During his time at [[Trek World Racing]], he won two World Cup Overall titles, in 2011 and 2012.
