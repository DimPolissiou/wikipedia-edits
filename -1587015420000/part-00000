She is also distantly descended from the family of Archbishop [[James Ussher]].\n\nUssher was educated on a free place at the independent [[St Paul's Girls' School]]; she subsequently attended [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where she read [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics|PPE]], and [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College, London]], where she took a MSc in Economics.\n\n==Early career==\nIn her early career, she was chief economist for [[Britain in Europe]] and an economist at the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and the ''Centre for European Reform'', as well as working for MPs [[Paul Boateng]], [[Martin O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Clackmannan|Martin O'Neill]], [[Kim Howells]] and [[Adam Ingram (Labour politician)|Adam Ingram]].\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002 she also served as a councillor  for [[Vassall ward]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], where she chaired the [[Lambeth London Borough Council|Council's]] finance and environment scrutiny committees.

She was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[Margaret Hodge]], the Minister of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, until 29 June 2007.\n\nIn [[Gordon Brown]]'s first reshuffle, she was appointed as [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]], succeeding [[Ed Balls]]. The timing of her appointment, as the first signs of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|credit crunch]] appeared, meant that she was party to crucial meetings of the Tripartite Committee of [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], [[Financial Services Authority|FSA]] and the [[Bank of England]] as the authorities dealt with the collapse of [[Northern Rock]], the subsequent financial crisis and its legislative response.\n\nHer period in office also saw a review of the policy towards [[co-operatives]] and [[credit unions]], to give them greater commercial freedom and ability to expand. She also developed the policy leading to the [[Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008]] that redistributes unclaimed banking assets to community use, and the Savings Gateway Act 2009 that provides financial incentives to poorer people to save.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, she moved to become [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department for Work and Pensions]], taking on broad welfare reform responsibilities previously undertaken by [[Stephen Timms]] and [[James Plaskitt]].

In the claims she attempted to justify, she stated: \"The plumbing in the entire house is strange [...] The electrics are also odd [...] Most of the ceilings have [[Artex]] coverings.

Besides [[Old Norse]] ''\u00de\u00f3rr'', extensions of the god occur in [[Old English]] as {{lang|ang|\u00deunor}} and in [[Old High German]] as {{lang|goh|Donar}} ([[continental runic inscriptions|runic]] {{Runic|\u16a6\u16df\u16be\u16a8\u16b1}} {{lang|goh|\u00feonar}}). All forms of the deity stem from a [[Common Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deunraz}} (meaning ''thunder''). \n\nThor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the [[recorded history]] of the [[Germanic peoples]], from the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] of regions of {{lang|la|[[Germania]]|italic=no}}, to the tribal expansions of the [[Migration Period]], to his high popularity during the [[Viking Age]], when, in the face of the process of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], emblems of his hammer, {{lang|is|[[Mj\u00f6lnir]]|italic=no}}, were worn and [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] [[personal name]]s containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.\n\nDue to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout [[Norse mythology]]. Norse mythology, largely recorded in [[Iceland]] from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at least [[List of names of Thor|fifteen names]], is the husband of the golden-haired goddess {{lang|non|[[Sif]]|italic=no}}, is the lover of the {{lang|non|[[j\u00f6tunn]] [[J\u00e1rnsaxa]]|italic=no}}, and is generally described as fierce eyed, [[red hair]]ed and red bearded.<ref name=\"HAIR-COLOR\">On the red beard and the use of \"Redbeard\" as an epithet for Thor, see [[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.R.

Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week [[Thursday]] bears his name (modern English ''Thursday'' derives from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g}}, '\u00deunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]].\n\n==Name==\nOld Norse {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} ({{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a6\u16a2\u16b1|italic=no}}}}), Old English {{lang|ang|\u00f0unor}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Donar}}, [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|thunar}}, and [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|thuner}} are [[Cognate|cognates]] within the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] branch. They descend from the [[Proto-Germanic]] masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00feunraz}} 'thunder',<ref name=\"OREL-429\">Orel (2003:429).</ref> and ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for 'thunder' ''*(s)tenh\u2082-'', with another cognate in the Celtic god [[Taranis]] (''*Torano'')''.''<ref>Matasovi\u0107 (2009:384).</ref>\n\nThe name of the god is the origin of the weekday name ''[[Thursday]]''. By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"[[Isis]]\".<ref name=\"BIRLEY42\">Birley (1999:42).</ref> In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god [[Odin]] as \"[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\", Thor as \"Hercules\", and the god {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[Isis]] of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god. In relation, {{lang|ang|Thunor}} is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss ''Jupiter'', the god may be referenced in the poem ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]'', where the thunder strikes the devil with a \"fiery axe\", and the Old English expression {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} (\"thunder ride\") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led chariot.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\">Turville-Petre (1964:99)</ref><ref name=\"THUNOR\">See North (1998:238\u2014241) for {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} and tales regarding {{lang|ang|Thunor}}, see ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (1910:608) regarding usage of {{lang|ang|Thunor}} as an Old English gloss for ''Jupiter'' and {{lang|ang|[[T\u00fdr|Tiw]]}} employed as a gloss for ''Mars''.</ref>\n\nA 9th-century AD codex from [[Mainz]], Germany, known as the ''[[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]'', records the name of three Old Saxon gods, {{lang|osx|UU\u00f4den}} (Old Saxon \"[[Wodan]]\"), {{lang|osx|[[Seaxn\u0113at|Saxn\u00f4te]]}}, and {{lang|osx|Thunaer}}, by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally [[christianization of the Germanic peoples|converting to Christianity]].<ref name=\"SIMEK276\">Simek (2007:276).</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentish royal legend]], probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of [[Ecgberht of Kent]] called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as {{lang|ang|\u00feunores hl\u00e6we}} (Old English 'Thunor's mound').

Adam details that the people of {{lang|sv|Uppsala|italic=no}} had appointed [[gothi|priests]] to each of the gods, and that the priests were to offer up [[bl\u00f3t|sacrifices]].

It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor.

In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile.

Besides [[Old Norse]] ''\u00de\u00f3rr'', extensions of the god occur in [[Old English]] as {{lang|ang|\u00deunor}} and in [[Old High German]] as {{lang|goh|Donar}} ([[continental runic inscriptions|runic]] {{Runic|\u16a6\u16df\u16be\u16a8\u16b1}} {{lang|goh|\u00feonar}}). All forms of the deity stem from a [[Common Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deunraz}} (meaning ''thunder''). \n\nThor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the [[recorded history]] of the [[Germanic peoples]], from the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] of regions of {{lang|la|[[Germania]]|italic=no}}, to the tribal expansions of the [[Migration Period]], to his high popularity during the [[Viking Age]], when, in the face of the process of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], emblems of his hammer, {{lang|is|[[Mj\u00f6lnir]]|italic=no}}, were worn and [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] [[personal name]]s containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.\n\nDue to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout [[Norse mythology]]. Norse mythology, largely recorded in [[Iceland]] from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at least [[List of names of Thor|fifteen names]], is the husband of the golden-haired goddess {{lang|non|[[Sif]]|italic=no}}, is the lover of the {{lang|non|[[j\u00f6tunn]] [[J\u00e1rnsaxa]]|italic=no}}, and is generally described as fierce eyed, [[red hair]]ed and red bearded.<ref name=\"HAIR-COLOR\">On the red beard and the use of \"Redbeard\" as an epithet for Thor, see [[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.R.

Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week [[Thursday]] bears his name (modern English ''Thursday'' derives from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g}}, '\u00deunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]].\n\n==Name==\nOld Norse {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} ({{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a6\u16a2\u16b1|italic=no}}}}), Old English {{lang|ang|\u00f0unor}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Donar}}, [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|thunar}}, and [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|thuner}} are [[Cognate|cognates]] within the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] branch. They descend from the [[Proto-Germanic]] masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00feunraz}} 'thunder',<ref name=\"OREL-429\">Orel (2003:429).</ref> and ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for 'thunder' ''*(s)tenh\u2082-'', with another cognate in the Celtic god [[Taranis]] (''*Torano'')''.''<ref>Matasovi\u0107 (2009:384).</ref>\n\nThe name of the god is the origin of the weekday name ''[[Thursday]]''. By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"[[Isis]]\".<ref name=\"BIRLEY42\">Birley (1999:42).</ref> In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god [[Odin]] as \"[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\", Thor as \"Hercules\", and the god {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[Isis]] of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god. In relation, {{lang|ang|Thunor}} is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss ''Jupiter'', the god may be referenced in the poem ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]'', where the thunder strikes the devil with a \"fiery axe\", and the Old English expression {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} (\"thunder ride\") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led chariot.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\">Turville-Petre (1964:99)</ref><ref name=\"THUNOR\">See North (1998:238\u2014241) for {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} and tales regarding {{lang|ang|Thunor}}, see ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (1910:608) regarding usage of {{lang|ang|Thunor}} as an Old English gloss for ''Jupiter'' and {{lang|ang|[[T\u00fdr|Tiw]]}} employed as a gloss for ''Mars''.</ref>\n\nA 9th-century AD codex from [[Mainz]], Germany, known as the ''[[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]'', records the name of three Old Saxon gods, {{lang|osx|UU\u00f4den}} (Old Saxon \"[[Wodan]]\"), {{lang|osx|[[Seaxn\u0113at|Saxn\u00f4te]]}}, and {{lang|osx|Thunaer}}, by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally [[christianization of the Germanic peoples|converting to Christianity]].<ref name=\"SIMEK276\">Simek (2007:276).</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentish royal legend]], probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of [[Ecgberht of Kent]] called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as {{lang|ang|\u00feunores hl\u00e6we}} (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:99\u2013100); variant texts in mss.

Adam details that the people of {{lang|sv|Uppsala|italic=no}} had appointed [[gothi|priests]] to each of the gods, and that the priests were to offer up [[bl\u00f3t|sacrifices]].

Early depictions portray Olaf as clean-shaven, but after 1200 he appears with a red beard.{{sfn|Lindahl|McNamara|Lindow|2002|p=299}} For centuries, Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of [[troll]]s and giants, and as a protector against malicious forces.{{sfn|Ast\u00e5s|1993|p=446}}\n\n===Modern folklore===\nTales about Thor, or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor, continued into the modern period, particularly in Scandinavia. Writing in the 19th century, scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god, such as the Norwegian {{lang|no|Thorsvarme}} (\"Thor's warmth\") for lightning and the Swedish {{lang|sv|godgubben \u00e5far}} (\"The good old (fellow) is taking a ride\") as well as the word {{wikt-lang|sv|tord\u00f6n}} (\"Thor's rumble\" or \"Thor's thunder\") when it thunders. Grimm comments that, at times, Scandinavians often \"no longer liked to utter the god's real name, or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness\".<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\">Grimm (1882:166\u201477).</ref>\n\nThor remained pictured as a red-bearded figure, as evident by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as {{lang|da|Thor med sit lange sk\u00e6g}} (\"Thor with the long beard\") and the [[North-Frisia]]n curse {{lang|frr|diis ruadhiiret donner regiir!}} (\"let red-haired thunder see to that!\").<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\"/>\n\nA Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away [[troll]]s and {{lang|non|j\u00f6tnar|italic=no}} appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\".<ref name=\"LINDOW89\">See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states, \"The dread entertained by the Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor, the god of thunder, being the deadly foe of their race.\"</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[The Sagas of Veluwe]] has a story called ''Ontstaan van het Uddeler- en Bleeke meer'' which features Thor and that he fights giants.<ref>Weggelaar, Eva.

It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. ... Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.<ref name=\"DAVIDSON12-13\">Davidson (1965:12\u201413).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSwastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age, such as the 3rd century [[Alu (runic)#V\u00e6rl\u00f8se Fibula|{{lang|da|V\u00e6rl\u00f8se|nocat=yes|italic=no}} Fibula]] (DR EM85;123) from [[Zealand]], Denmark; the [[Goths|Gothic]] spearhead from [[Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus; numerous Migration Period [[bracteate]]s; cremation urns from early [[Anglo-Saxon England]]; the 8th century [[S\u00e6b\u00f8 sword|{{lang|da|S\u00e6b\u00f8|nocat=yes|italic=no}} sword]] from {{lang|no|[[Sogn]]|italic=no}}, Norway; and the 9th century [[Snoldelev Stone]] (DR 248) from {{lang|da|[[Rams\u00f8]]|italic=no}}, Denmark.\n\n==Eponymy and toponymy==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Thorsager-Denmark-city-limit-sign.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = A city limit sign marking {{lang|da|[[Thorsager]]|italic=no}} (\"Thor's Acre\"), Denmark\n| image2    = Thursley Village Sign - geograph.org.uk - 691939.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| width2    = \n| caption2  = Sign for the village of [[Thursley]] in Surrey, England\n}}\nNumerous place names in [[Scandinavia]] contain the Old Norse name {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}}. The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements {{lang|non|-v\u00e9}} (signifying the location of a {{lang|non|[[v\u00e9]]|italic=no}}, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), {{lang|non|\u2013h\u00f3f}} (a structure used for religious purposes, see [[heathen hofs]]), and {{lang|non|\u2013lundr}} (a [[Sacred_trees_and_groves_in_Germanic_paganism_and_mythology|holy grove]]).

Thor also appears in many placenames in [[Uppland]].\n\nIn [[English placenames]], Old English {{lang|ang|Thunor}} (in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name, later introduced to the [[Danelaw]]) left comparatively few traces. Examples include [[Thundersley]], from *{{lang|ang|Thunores hl\u00e6w}} and ''Thurstable'' (Old English \"Thunor's pillar\").<ref name=\"SIMEK321\"/> F. M.

(Compare [[Thunderstone (folklore)|Thunderstones]].) Similarly, [[meteorites]] may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight. On the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], a species of beetle (''Scarab\u00e6us stercorarius'') was named after the god; the {{lang|is|Thorbagge}}. When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over, Thor's favor may be gained. In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as {{lang|is|Thordedjefvul}} or {{lang|is|Thordyfvel}} (both meaning \"Thor-devil\").<ref name=\"THORPE-1851-51-54\">Thorpe (1851:51\u201454).</ref>\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretations==\nThor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] [[Taranis]],<ref>De Vries (1957:111).</ref><ref name=\"SIMEK322\">Simek (2007:322).</ref> the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] {{lang|lt|[[Perk\u016bnas]]|italic=no}}, the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[Perun]],<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:96\u201397).</ref> and particularly the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Indra]]|italic=no}}, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the {{lang|sa-Latn|[[vajra]]|italic=no}} are obvious parallels.

Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile.

Indeed, the authors found that the system was so unstable that it simply cannot exist, with mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole range of plausible orbital solutions. Like other planetary systems proposed around similar evolved binary star systems, it seems likely that some mechanism other than claimed planets is responsible for the observed behaviour of the binary stars \u2013 and that the claimed planets simply do not exist.\n\n==== Kepler-16 ====\nOn 15 September 2011, astronomers, using data from NASA's [[Kepler space telescope]], announced the first partial-eclipse-based discovery of a circumbinary planet.<ref>Doyle, Laurance, et al.

The innermost planets in all the Kepler circumbinary systems have been found orbiting close to this radius. The planets have [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] that lie between 1.09 and 1.46 times this critical radius.

Because of the stellar binarity, the insolation received by the planet will likely be time-varying in a way quite unlike the regular sunlight Earth receives.<ref name=\"WelshOroszCarterFabrycky\"/>\n\n'''<big>Transit Probability</big>'''\n\nCircumbinary planets are generally more likely to transit than planets around a single star.

Like the Yebirs, the Midgans also practise medicine, and have the reputation of being extremely clever charlatans.

Modern tuckpointing tools are constructed from hardened [[tool steel]]. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools are heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available:\n\"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\",\n\"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\",\n\"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \n\"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the process of renewing the external part of mortar joints|Repointing}}\n \n[[Image:Tuck pointing Westminster.jpg|thumb|Brickwork of [[10 Downing Street]], showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar]]'''Tuckpointing''' (also called tuck pointing or tuck-pointing) is a way of using two contrasting colours of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[brickwork]], with one colour matching the bricks themselves to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made.

In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n<references />\nhttps://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools/\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "name_user": "Muhammadalishahid856", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckpointing"}

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the presence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').
