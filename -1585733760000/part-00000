The later medieval historians, Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad, Badaoni, [[Ferishta]] and Haji-ud-Dabir depended upon the ''Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi'' for their account of history of the period covered in this work.

Conrad|Charles Conrad]] and ballet with Nina Fonaroff.\n\n== Career ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}\nAfter securing a seven-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1958, Baker made her film debut when she was chosen by director [[George Stevens]] to play [[Margot Frank]] in the 1959 motion picture ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''. In the same year, she starred in ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' with [[James Mason]] and in ''[[The Best of Everything (1959 film)|The Best of Everything]]'' with [[Hope Lange]] and [[Joan Crawford]].\n\nOther Fox films in which Baker appeared include the assassination thriller ''[[Nine Hours to Rama]]'', ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]'' and ''[[The 300 Spartans]]''. Her television work, which began in the 1960s, includes appearances on ''[[Follow the Sun (TV series)|Follow the Sun]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'', ''[[Lloyd Bridges|The Lloyd Bridges Show]]'', ''[[The Nurses (Primetime CBS drama)|The Nurses]]'', ''[[The Invaders]]'' (in the first episode), and two episodes of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nFinally out of her contract with Fox after starring in the fourth screen version of [[Grace Miller White]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1960 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]'' and ''The 300 Spartans'' (1962), Baker appeared in ''[[Stolen Hours]]'', a 1963 remake of ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (Mirisch Corp. and United Artists), and, the same year, opposite [[Paul Newman]] and [[Elke Sommer]] in ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]'' (MGM). From 1963 to 1966, Baker had a recurring role on the medical drama ''[[Dr. Kildare#Television|Dr. Kildare]]''.\n\nIn 1964, she co-starred with [[Joan Crawford]] in both ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'', William Castle's thriller about an axe murderess, and an unsold television pilot ''Royal Bay'', released to theaters as ''[[Della (film)|Della]]''. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] cast her in his film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) as Lil Mainwaring, the sister-in-law of Mark Rutland ([[Sean Connery]]). She co-starred with [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in the thriller ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' (1965), directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], and in ''[[Krakatoa, East of Java]]'' (1969) with [[Maximilian Schell]]. In the TV movie Western ''The Dangerous Days of Kiowa Jones'' (1966), she played the role of a woman who falls in love with a drifter ([[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]]) who is deputized by a dying marshal to take two killers (one of whom is played by [[Sal Mineo]]) to a distant jail.\n\nIn August 1967, Baker had the distinction of playing [[David Janssen]]'s love interest in the two-part finale of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which became [[List of most watched television broadcasts|the most-watched show]] in the history of episodic television up until that time. In 1968, she co-starred with [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] in the Disney film ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. In January 1970, she had the lead guest-starring female role as Princess Francesca in the only three-episode mission of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''. In 1973, Baker co-starred in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Here We Go Again (TV series)|Here We Go Again]]''. The series was canceled after one season. In 1976, she played the frequently drunken daughter of the title character of the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"Last Salute to the Commodore\", which departed from the usual show format whereby the viewer knows very early who the murderer is.\n\nIn the decades after ''Mirage'', she appeared frequently on television and began producing films, including the drama film ''[[Never Never Land (film)|Never Never Land]]'' (1980) and the [[miniseries]] ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]'' (1984), in which she played Laura. She reemerged on the big screen in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) as Senator Ruth Martin (\"Love your suit,\" [[Hannibal Lecter]] memorably said to her). Baker also appeared in the films ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'' and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]''. She guest-starred in four episodes of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' in 2005, 2008 and twice in 2012 as Blythe House, the mother of the title character.\n\nBaker spent more than a decade teaching acting at the [[Academy of Art University]], the nation's largest accredited private art and design school, in San Francisco.

She is the daughter of Dorothy Helen Harrington, who had appeared in several early [[Marx Brothers]] movies, and automobile salesperson Clyde Lucius Baker. Baker has two younger sisters, Patricia and Cheryl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinesourcemagazine.com/index.php?/site/comments/diane_baker_creating_films_schools_and_communities/|website=CineSOURCE Magazine|date=August 13, 2010|title=Diane Baker: Creating Films, Schools, and Communities|first=Doniphan|last=Blair}}</ref> At age 18, after graduating from [[Van Nuys High School]] in 1956, Baker moved to New York to study acting with [[Charles E. Conrad|Charles Conrad]] and ballet with Nina Fonaroff.\n\n== Career ==\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}\nAfter securing a seven-year contract with [[20th Century Fox]] in 1958, Baker made her film debut when she was chosen by director [[George Stevens]] to play [[Margot Frank]] in the 1959 motion picture ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''. In the same year, she starred in ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' with [[James Mason]] and in ''[[The Best of Everything (1959 film)|The Best of Everything]]'' with [[Hope Lange]] and [[Joan Crawford]].\n\nOther Fox films in which Baker appeared include the assassination thriller ''[[Nine Hours to Rama]]'', ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]'' and ''[[The 300 Spartans]]''. Her television work, which began in the 1960s, includes appearances on ''[[Follow the Sun (TV series)|Follow the Sun]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'', ''[[Lloyd Bridges|The Lloyd Bridges Show]]'', ''[[The Nurses (Primetime CBS drama)|The Nurses]]'', ''[[The Invaders]]'' (in the first episode), and two episodes of ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n\nFinally out of her contract with Fox after starring in the fourth screen version of [[Grace Miller White]]'s novel ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1960 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]'' and ''The 300 Spartans'' (1962), Baker appeared in ''[[Stolen Hours]]'', a 1963 remake of ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (Mirisch Corp. and United Artists), and, the same year, opposite [[Paul Newman]] and [[Elke Sommer]] in ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]'' (MGM). From 1963 to 1966, Baker had a recurring role on the medical drama ''[[Dr. Kildare#Television|Dr. Kildare]]''.\n\nIn 1964, she co-starred with [[Joan Crawford]] in both ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'', William Castle's thriller about an axe murderess, and an unsold television pilot ''Royal Bay'', released to theaters as ''[[Della (film)|Della]]''. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] cast her in his film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) as Lil Mainwaring, the sister-in-law of Mark Rutland ([[Sean Connery]]). She co-starred with [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in the thriller ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' (1965), directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], and in ''[[Krakatoa, East of Java]]'' (1969) with [[Maximilian Schell]]. In the TV movie Western ''The Dangerous Days of Kiowa Jones'' (1966), she played the role of a woman who falls in love with a drifter ([[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]]) who is deputized by a dying marshal to take two killers (one of whom is played by [[Sal Mineo]]) to a distant jail.\n\nIn August 1967, Baker had the distinction of playing [[David Janssen]]'s love interest in the two-part finale of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', which became [[List of most watched television broadcasts|the most-watched show]] in the history of episodic television up until that time. In 1968, she co-starred with [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]] in the Disney film ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. In January 1970, she had the lead guest-starring female role as Princess Francesca in the only three-episode mission of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]''. In 1973, Baker co-starred in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Here We Go Again (TV series)|Here We Go Again]]''. The series was canceled after one season. In 1976, she played the frequently drunken daughter of the title character of the ''[[Columbo]]'' episode \"Last Salute to the Commodore\", which departed from the usual show format whereby the viewer knows very early who the murderer is.\n\nIn the decades after ''Mirage'', she appeared frequently on television and began producing films, including the drama film ''[[Never Never Land (film)|Never Never Land]]'' (1980) and the [[miniseries]] ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]'' (1984), in which she played Laura. She reemerged on the big screen in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) as Senator Ruth Martin (\"Love your suit,\" [[Hannibal Lecter]] memorably said to her). Baker also appeared in the films ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'' and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]''. She guest-starred in four episodes of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' in 2005, 2008 and twice in 2012 as Blythe House, the mother of the title character.\n\nBaker spent more than a decade teaching acting at the [[Academy of Art University]], the nation's largest accredited private art and design school, in San Francisco. She was formerly the Executive Director of the School of Motion Pictures-Television and the School of Acting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Extraordinary-adventure-lures-ex-ingenue-2730297.php|first=Ruthe|last=Stein|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 27, 2004|title='Extraordinary adventure' lures ex-ingenue}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= |first1= |title=Academy of Art University School of Acting \u2013 Faculty|url=http://www.academyart.edu/academics/acting/faculty|publisher=[[Academy of Art University]]|accessdate=2 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221173349/http://www.academyart.edu/academics/acting/faculty|archive-date=December 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Selected TV and filmography ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=4|1959\n| ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''\n| [[Margot Frank]]\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''\n| Jenny Lindenbrook\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Best of Everything (film)|The Best of Everything]]''\n| April Morrison\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Playhouse 90]]''\n| Shelia Cass\n| Episode: \"In Lonely Expectation\"\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1960\n| ''[[DuPont Show of the Month|The DuPont Show of the Month]]''\n| Nurse Leora Tozer\n| Episode: \"Arrowsmith\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Wizard of Baghdad]]''\n| Princess Yasmin\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Tess of the Storm Country (1960 film)|Tess of the Storm Country]]''\n| Tess MacLean\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=2|1961\n| ''[[Follow the Sun (TV series)|Follow the Sun]]''\n| Helen Henderson\n| Episode: \"Journey Into Darkness\"\n|-\n| ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]''\n| Veronica Sanders\n| Episode: \"Vendetta\"\n|-\n| rowspan=2|1962\n| ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]''\n| Carolyn\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The 300 Spartans]]''\n| Ellas\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=7|1963\n| ''[[The Nurses (CBS TV series)|The Doctors and the Nurses]]''\n| Marjorie Ford\n| Episode: \"Field of Battle\"\n|-\n| ''[[Nine Hours to Rama]]''\n| Sheila\n|\n|-\n| ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]''\n| Emily Stratman\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Stolen Hours]]''\n| Ellen\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Mr. Novak]]''\n| Mrs. Chase\n| Episode: \"A Feeling for Friday\"\n|-\n| ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''\n| Elisa\n| Episode: \"The Cruelest Sea of All\"\n|-\n| ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''\n| Marie Duplessis\n| Episode: \"Come Out, Come Out, Wherever You Are!\"\n|-\n| rowspan=5|1964\n| ''[[Strait-Jacket]]''\n| Carol Harbin\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]''\n| Lil Mainwaring\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Della (film)|Della]]''\n| Jenny Chappell\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Wagon Train]]''\n| Alice Whitetree\n| Episode: \"The Alice Whitetree Story\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]''\n| Vivia Mandour\n| Television movie\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1965\n| ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]''\n| Shela\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Inherit the Wind (1965 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''\n| Rachel Brown\n| Television movie\n|-\n| ''[[The Big Valley]]''\n| Hester\n| Episode: \"By Fires Unseen\"\n|-\n| rowspan=4|1966\n| ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''\n| Linda Valence\n| Episode: \"Linda\"\n|-\n| ''Sands of Beersheba''\n| Susan\n| Alternative title: ''Thunder Over Israel''\n|-\n| ''[[Hawk (TV series)|Hawk]]''\n| Mary Wheelis\n| Episode: \"The Longleat Chronicles\"\n|-\n| ''The Dangerous Days of Kiowa Jones''\n| Amilia Rathmore\n| Television movie\n|-\n| rowspan=3|1967\n| ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''\n| Jean Carlisle\n| Episodes: \"The Judgement\" (Parts 1 & 2)\n|-\n| ''[[The Invaders]]''\n| Kathy Adams\n| Episode: \"Beachhead\"\n|-\n| ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]''\n| Laney\n| Episode: \"Free of Charge\"\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''\n| Suzie \"S.J.\" Clemens\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=5|1969\n| ''[[Krakatoa, East of Java]]''\n| Laura Travis\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Trial Run (1969 film)|Trial Run]]''\n| Carole Trenet\n| Television movie\n|-\n| ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''\n| Julie Oakes\n| Episode: \"A Love to Remember\"\n|-\n| ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]''\n| Elaine Brennan\n| Episode: \"Give Till It Hurts\"\n|-\n| ''[[The D.A.
