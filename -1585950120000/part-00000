It has effectively existed since the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]]. Many films using [[computer generated imagery]] have featured synthetic images of human-like characters [[digital compositing|digitally composited]] onto the real or other simulated film material. Towards the end of the [[2010s (decade)|2010s]] [[deep learning]] [[artificial intelligence]] has been applied to [[media_synthesis_(AI)|synthesize images and video]] that look like humans, without need for human assistance, once the training phase has been completed, whereas the old school 7D-route required massive amounts of human work.\n\n== Timeline of human image synthesis ==\n{{main|History of computer animation|Timeline of computer animation in film and television}}\n* '''In 1971''' [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]] made the first [[Computer graphics|CG]] [[geometry]] [[digitization|capture]] and representation of a human face. Modeling was his wife Sylvie Gouraud. The 3D model was a simple [[wire-frame model]] and he applied [[Gouraud shading|the Gouraud shader he is most known for]] to produce the first known representation of human-likeness on computer [http://interstices.info/jcms/c_25256/images-de-synthese-palme-de-la-longevite-pour-lombrage-de-gouraud (view images)].<ref>{{cite web|title=Images de synth\u00e8se : palme de la long\u00e9vit\u00e9 pour l'ombrage de Gouraud|url=http://interstices.info/jcms/c_25256/images-de-synthese-palme-de-la-longevite-pour-lombrage-de-gouraud}}</ref>\n* The '''1972''' short film ''[[A Computer Animated Hand]]'' by [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Fred Parke]] was the first time that [[computer-generated imagery]] was used in film to simulate moving human appearance. The film featured a computer simulated hand and face [http://vimeo.com/16292363 (watch film here)].\n* The '''1976''' film ''[[Futureworld]]'' reused parts of ''A Computer Animated Hand'' on the big screen.\n* The '''1983''' [[Musique Non-Stop#Music video|music video for song Musique Non-Stop]] by German band [[Kraftwerk]] aired in 1986. Created by the artist [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], it features non-realistic looking, but clearly recognizable computer simulations of the band members.\n* The '''1994''' film [[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]] was the first film production to make use of digital compositing of a computer simulated representation of a face onto scenes filmed using a [[body double]]. Necessity was the muse as the actor [[Brandon Lee]] portraying the protagonist was tragically killed accidentally on-stage.\n* In '''[[SIGGRAPH]] 2000''' [[Paul Debevec]] et al. of [[University of Southern California|USC]] presented a method to capture the reflectance field over the human face with their first version of a [[light stage]].<ref name=\"Deb2000\"/> \n[[File:BSSDF01_400.svg|thumb|right|300px|BRDF vs. subsurface scattering inclusive BSSRDF i.e. [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function#Overview of the BxDF functions|Bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function]]]]\n* In '''2003''' [[audience]] debut of photo realistic human-likenesses in the 2003 films ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' in [[The Matrix Reloaded#Visual effects|the burly brawl sequence]] where up-to-100 [[Agent Smith]]s fight [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and in ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' where at the start of the end showdown Agent Smith's [[cheekbone]] gets punched in by Neo leaving the digital look-alike unnaturally unhurt.

So equipped only with a movable light source, movable video camera, 2 polarizers and a computer program doing extremely simple math and the last piece required to reach photorealism was acquired.<ref name=\"Deb2000\"/>\n\nFor a believable result both light [[Reflection (computer graphics)|reflected]] from skin ([[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|BRDF]]) and within the skin (a special case of [[Bidirectional transmittance distribution function|BTDF]]) which together make up the [[bidirectional scattering distribution function|BSDF]] must be captured and simulated.\n\n== Capture ==\n[[File:VIUscan handheld 3D scanner in use.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hand held [[3D scanning|three-dimensional scanner]].]]\n* The 3D [[geometry]] and [[texture mapping|textures]] are captured onto a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer model|model]] by a [[3D reconstruction]] method, such as [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] the target by means of [[3D scanning]] with an [[RGB]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|XYZ]] scanner such as [[Arius3d]] or [[Cyberware (company)|Cyberware]] (textures from photos, not pure RGB XYZ scanner), [[Photogrammetry#Stereophotogrammetry|stereophotogrammetrically]] from [[multiple-camera setup|synchronized photos]] or even from enough repeated non-simultaneous [[photography|photos]]. \n* For believable results also the [[reflectance field]] must be captured or an approximation must be picked from the libraries to form a 7D reflectance model of the target.\n\n== Synthesis ==\n\nThe whole process of making digital look-alikes i.e. characters so lifelike and realistic that they can be passed off as pictures of humans is a very complex task as it requires photorealistically [[3D modeling|modeling]], [[animating]], [[cross-mapping]], and [[3D rendering|rendering]] the [[soft body dynamics]] of the human appearance.\n\nSynthesis with an [[actor]] and suitable [[algorithm]]s is applied using powerful [[computer]]s.  The actor's part in the synthesis is to take care of mimicking human [[Facial expression|expressions]] in still picture synthesizing and also human movement in [[motion picture]] synthesizing. Algorithms are needed to simulate laws of [[physics]] and [[physiology]] and to map the models and their appearance, movements and interaction accordingly.\n\nOften both [[physics]]/[[physiology]] based (i.e. [[skeletal animation]]) and [[image-based modeling and rendering]] are employed in the synthesis part. Hybrid models employing both approaches have shown best results in realism and ease-of-use.\n\nUsing [[displacement mapping]] plays an important part in getting a realistic result with fine detail of skin such as [[Sweat gland|pore]]s and [[wrinkle]]s as small as 100 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\nMain applications fall within the domains of [[virtual cinematography]], computer and [[video games]] and [[covert]] [[disinformation]] [[Offensive (military)|attack]]s.\n\nFurthermore, some research suggests that it can have [[Therapy|therapeutic effects]] as \"[[psychologist]]s and [[Mental health counselor|counselor]]s have also begun using [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] to deliver therapy to clients who have [[phobias]], a history of [[Trauma (psychology)|trauma]], [[addiction]]s, [[Asperger\u2019s syndrome]] or [[social anxiety]].\"<ref name=\"Mur2011\"/> The strong memory imprint and brain activation effects caused by watching a digital look-alike avatar of yourself is dubbed the [[doppelg\u00e4nger effect]].<ref name=\"Mur2011\">\n{{cite web\n  | last = Murphy\n  | first = Samantha\n  | author-link = \n  | title = Scientific American: Your Avatar, Your Guide\n  | website =\n  | publisher = Scientific American / Uni of Stanford\n  | year = 2011\n  | url = https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2011/sciam-your-avatar.pdf\n  | format = .pdf\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =  2013-06-29}}\n</ref>\nThe doppelg\u00e4nger effect can heal when covert disinformation attack is exposed as such to the targets of the attack.\n\n==Machine learning approach==\nIn the late 2010s, [[machine learning]], and more precisely [[generative adversarial networks]] (GAN), were used by [[NVIDIA]] to produce random yet photorealistic human portraits.\nThe GAN was trained on a database of 70,000 images from the images depository website [[Flickr]].\nOutputs of the generator network from random input were made publicly available on a website <ref>[http://thispersondoesnotexist.com StyleGAN public showcase website]</ref>.\nThe source code was made public on [[GitHub]] in 2019.\n\n== Related issues ==\nThe [[speech synthesis#Digital sound-alikes|speech synthesis]] is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software [[Adobe Voco]], a prototype slated to be a part of the [[Adobe Creative Suite]] and [[DeepMind]] [[WaveNet]], a prototype from [[Google]].<ref name=deepmind.com2016>\n{{cite web\n |url= https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/\n |title= WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio\n |last=\n |first=\n |date= 2016-09-08\n |website= Deepmind.com\n |access-date= 2017-05-24\n |quote= }}\n</ref>\nAbility to steal and manipulate other peoples voices raises obvious ethical concerns.\n<ref name=BBC2016>{{cite web\n |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37899902\n |title= Adobe Voco 'Photoshop-for-voice' causes concern\n |last=\n |first=\n |date= 2016-11-07\n |website= [[BBC.com]]\n |publisher= [[BBC]]\n |access-date= 2016-07-05\n |quote= }}\n</ref>\n\nThis coupled with the fact that (as of 2016) techniques which allow [[Real-time computing#Near real-time|near real-time]] [[forgery|counterfeiting]] of [[facial expressions]] in existing 2D video have been believably demonstrated increases the stress on the disinformation situation.<ref name=Thi2016/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Motion-capture acting]]\n* [[Internet manipulation]]\n* [[Media synthesis (AI)]]\n* [[Propaganda techniques]]\n* [[3D data acquisition and object reconstruction]]\n* [[3D reconstruction from multiple images]]\n* [[3D pose estimation]] in general and [[articulated body pose estimation]] especially to do with capturing human likeness.\n* [[4D reconstruction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Simulation]]\n[[Category:Computer graphics]]\n[[Category:Pornography]]\n[[Category:Forgery controversies]]\n[[Category:Propaganda techniques]]\n[[Category:Special effects]]\n[[Category:Applications of computer vision]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTimeline of human image synthesis:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: et al \u2192 et al.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_image_synthesis"}

In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal.

The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.<ref name=PM/>\nContrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yersin|first=Alexandre|year=1894|orig-year=|title=La peste bubonique \u00e0 Hong-Kong|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/index.php?p=3&cote=epo1234&do=page|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|volume=8|pages=662\u201367}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n{{Main|Plague vaccine}}\nSince human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with [[enzootic]] plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western [[United States]]. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels.

After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon.

Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as [[diphtheria]]), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced.

In [[septicemia|septicemic]] plague, bacterial endotoxins cause [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with [[antibiotics]] reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent.<ref name=\"Wagle1948\">{{cite journal| author=Wagle PM| title=Recent advances in the treatment of bubonic plague| journal=Indian J Med Sci| year=1948| volume=2| pages=489\u201394| ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=\"Meyer1950\">{{cite journal| author=Meyer KF| title=Modern therapy of plague| year=1950| journal=J Am Med Assoc| volume=144| pages=982\u201385| pmid=14774219| issue=12| doi=10.1001/jama.1950.02920120006003| ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"DattGupta1948\">{{cite journal| author=Datt Gupta AK| title=A short note on plague cases treated at Campbell Hospital| journal=Ind Med Gaz| year=1948| volume=83| pages=150\u201351| ref=harv}}</ref> People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Pneumonic plague===\n{{Main|Pneumonic plague}}\nThe [[pneumonia|pneumonic]] form of plague arises from [[infection]] of the [[human lung|lungs]].

The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.<ref name=PM/>\nContrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the [[flea]]s (''[[Xenopsylla cheopis]]'') that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new person and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yersin|first=Alexandre|year=1894|orig-year=|title=La peste bubonique \u00e0 Hong-Kong|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/histoire/medica/resultats/index.php?p=3&cote=epo1234&do=page|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|volume=8|pages=662\u201367}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\n{{Main|Plague vaccine}}\nSince human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with [[enzootic]] plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western [[United States]].

{"title_page": "Water Scarcity in India", "text_new": "[[Water scarcity]] in [[India]] is an ongoing water crisis in India that affects nearly 600 million people each year. <ref>{{Cite book|last=NITI Aayog|first=|url=https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2019-08/CWMI-2.0-latest.pdf|title=COMPOSITE WATER MANAGEMENT INDEX|publisher=National Institute for Transforming India|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>In addition to the huge rural and urban population, the water scarcity in India also extensively affects the ecosystem and [[agriculture]]. India only has 4% of the world\u2019s fresh water resources despite having a population of over 1.3 billion. <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Dhawan|first=Vibha|date=|title=Water and Agriculture in India|url=https://www.oav.de/fileadmin/user_upload/5_Publikationen/5_Studien/170118_Study_Water_Agriculture_India.pdf|journal=Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In addition to the disproportionate availability of freshwater, water scarcity in India primarily results from drying up of rivers and their reservoirs in the summer months right before the onset of the [[monsoons]] throughout the country. The crisis has especially worsened in the recent years due to [[climate change]] which results in delayed monsoons consequently drying out reservoirs in several regions. Other factors attributed to the shortage of water in India are a lack of proper infrastructure, government oversight and [[water pollution]].    \n\nThe acute shortage of water for daily needs has prompted many government and non government organisations to take stringent measures to combat the problem. The [[Government of India]] has launched multiple schemes and programs, including the formation of an entire \u2018[[Jan Shakti Party of India|Jal Shakti]]\u2019 Ministry to deal with the ongoing problem. The government has also insisted on techniques such as [[rainwater harvesting]], water conservation and more efficient [[irrigation]]. Agriculture alone is responsible for 80% of the country\u2019s water usage.<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\nSeveral large cities of India have experienced water shortages in recent years, with [[Chennai]] being the most prominent in 2019. The shortage of water affected the entire city of 9 million people and resulted in the closure of several hotels, restaurants and businesses. According to a report by the [[NITI Aayog|National Institution for Transforming India]] (NITI), at least 21 major Indian cities, including the capital [[New Delhi]] will completely run out of groundwater by 2020. The report also noted that approximately 200,000 people die in India each year due to the lack of access to safe drinking water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/indias-water-crisis-bengaluru-delhi-chennai-hyderabad-among-21-cities-to-run-out-of-groundwater-by-2020-4590221.html|title=Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai among 21 cities to run out of groundwater by 2020- Technology News, Firstpost|date=2018-06-25|website=Tech2|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n=== People ===\nThe scarcity of water in India affects hundreds of millions of people across the country. A major portion of the population does not have a reliable and constant means of getting water for their daily needs. In June 2019, 65% of all reservoirs in India reported below-normal water levels, and 12% were completely dry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/water-crisis-two-third-of-indias-reservoirs-have-below-normal-storage-maximum-are-dry-in-maha-2202279.html|title=65% of India\u2019s Reservoirs Running Dry, Maharashtra Worst Affected, Shows Water Panel's Report|website=News18|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Since tap water is unavailable in many cities including some megacities such as [[Chennai]], residents are reliant on alternative water sources.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Khadka|first=Navin Singh|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49232374|title=Global report warns of Indian water crisis|date=2019-08-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-03|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country has scattered public water pumps but a lot of them are located far away from cities and their water flow is intermittent and unpredictable. A lot of Indians are forced with the option of spending money to buy drinking water but the poor sections of the society are unable to afford it on a daily basis which creates a massive problem of water scarcity for the rural population of India. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/major-indian-city-runs-out-water-million-people-pray-rain/|title=As a major Indian city runs out of water, 9 million people pray for rain|last=Masih|first=Niha|last2=AsiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow|first2=closeNiha MasihForeign correspondent covering IndiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowJoanna Slater closeJoanna SlaterForeign correspondent covering South|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nLimited accessibility to water is a threat to the people\u2019s health. Insufficient water has the capacity to deteriorate the health of an entire city in times of a water crisis. In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city. In June 2019 in Chennai, a woman was stabbed by her neighbor as she attempted to dig a borewell for water. <ref name=\":9\" />  \n\nIn February 2016, [[New Delhi]] was led to the brink of a severe water crisis by some [[Jat people|Jat tribe]] demonstrators who purposefully damaged the Munak canal, a crucial source of water supply for the city. The protests were in retaliation to the Supreme Court judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.  \n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or \u201ctanker mafia\u201d. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of Bhopal, where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=06/21/2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out. Eventually, local wild animals like elephants, tigers, and spotted deers started to sneak into the cities in search of water.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/Wild-animals-hit-by-water-scarcity/article16906373.ece|title=Wild animals hit by water scarcity|date=2016-12-19|work=The Hindu|access-date=2020-04-03|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>Some of these animals pose a threat to the citizens, as they can attack people. Some animals like spotted deers get physically attacked by dogs in the process, or they wind up injured or dead in accidents. In the [[Madurai]] district, the acute water shortage caused Indian gaurs to die by falling into wells as they looked for water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/Water-scarcity-leading-Indian-gaurs-to-death-traps/articleshow/20980502.cms|title=Water scarcity leading Indian gaurs to death traps {{!}} Madurai News - Times of India|last=Jul 9|first=J.

Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]] is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=2019-09-18|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" />The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=2019-06-27|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted. Although one of the most important river in India, [[Ganges|Ganga]] is also the one that is most severely polluted. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Ganga-a-deadly-source-of-cancer-now-Study/articleshow/16858510.cms|title=NCRP: Ganga a deadly source of cancer now: Study {{!}} Patna News - Times of India|last=Oct 18|first=Anirban Ghosh {{!}} TNN {{!}} Updated:|last2=2012|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03|last3=Ist|first3=04:26}}</ref> The pollution mostly results from untreated sewage from densely populated cities, industrial waste as well as due to religious ceremonies in and around the river.

The traditional techniques of irrigation are also to blame for the water crisis as they result in a majority of water loss and evaporation during the irrigation process.\n\n==== Wastage of water ====\nAccording to the Central Water Commission, even though climate change has resulted in a reduction in rainfall and thereby the water supply, the country still receives enough rainfall to meet the needs of over 1 billion people. However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIndia has also been lacking in the treatment of wastewater for reuse. Approximately 80 percent of domestic wastewater is drained out as waste and ends up flowing into other water bodies which lead on to salt water sources such as the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Efforts ==\n=== Government efforts ===\nThe Government of India has reformed several of its departments and initiated several water supply projects in the last 3 years to respond to the country\u2019s growing water needs. <ref name=\":4\" /> The reforms include the establishment of a new ministry for water known as the Jal Shakti Ministry. The government also launched several projects in the main rivers and underground water sources. The Indian government has claimed that the new ministry and projects could increase the whole country\u2019s water use efficiency by 20% in addition to enhancing the capacity of its water reserves and protecting the currently over-exploited area.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://nwm.gov.in/|title=National Water Mission, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, Government of India|website=nwm.gov.in|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Establish New Ministry Through Department Reorganization ====\nIn June 2019, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] launched a new plan, \u201cPiped Water for All by 2024\u201d in order to integrate different water resources management departments together to take charge of the ground and surface water depletion. <ref name=\":4\" />The newly formed Jal Shakti ministry is responsible for publishing the policy guideline for water resources usage, regulating and leading the water resources related projects, and dealing with the cooperation, facilitation, and negotiation of water resources both internationally and in between states. <ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPrior to the formation of the [[Jan Shakti Party of India|Jal Shakti]] ministry, water resources in India were managed by different departments under the governance of either the local state government or the union government. The new ministry combines the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation with the former Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The government aims that this step will prevent various departments from conflicting and overlapping with each other.

Despite the heavy reliance of public life on the river, it was named as one of the 10 most dangerous rivers in the world in 2007 due to [[water pollution]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/us-tv-host-takes-dig-at-ganges_587747.html|title=US TV host takes dig at Ganges|date=2009-12-16|website=Zee News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe first Ganga river cleaning program ([[Ganga Action Plan]]) was started in 1985 with an aim to tackle the problem of excessive water pollution in the river. The program led by government authority gradually expanded to look after the other rivers in India as well. Over the past 20 years, over \u00a3100m has been spent to mitigate the effect of industrial pollution on rivers and other water bodies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/Clean-Up-Or-Perish/articleshow/5699070.cms|title=Clean Up Or Perish - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> However, the Ganga Action Plan has not shown any signfificant results over the years. In 2018, the Central Pollution Control Board and National Green Tribunal of India reported that only 7% of the water region in Ganga River is drinkable and only about 10% of the water can be used for bathing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTo combat the problem of government incompetence in solving the water crisis, the [[Modi government]] announced that it will be launching new projects with more investment along with formulating new policies to manage the pollution in Ganga and other [[Indian rivers|rivers in India]]. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/23/india-the-national-ganga-river-basin-project|title=The National Ganga River Basin Project|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/namami-gange-improved-water-quality-of-ganga-amit-shah-813327.html|title='Namami Gange' improved water quality of Ganga: Amit Shah|date=2020-03-13|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-governmental efforts ===\nIndia has a huge number of Non Government Organisations that focus on solving water shortage problems for the citizens in affected areas.

They are actively involved in teaching the locals how to preserve the water resources and how to increase the water usage efficiency by installing new water gathering stations and improving their irrigation techniques. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=2016-03-22|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearewater.org/en-IN/our-foundation_253356|title=Our foundation|website=We Are Water|language=en-IN|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n\u2018We are Water\u2019 publishes documentary films every year broadcasting the severe water scarcity in India to raise social awareness. In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes. \n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nIndia Non-governmental organizations generally will establish their distinctive water saving or water supply projects to support the water scarcity region. For example, with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF,]] villagers in Palve Budruk, located in the drought-prone Parner Block in [[Ahmednagar]] district of [[Maharashtra]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available. The system has three check dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use only. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which time families fill up water for drinking and cooking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===== Jal Bhagirathi Foundation =====\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of Rajasthan. The foundation has covered over 550 villages and revived more than 2000 water harvesting structures in the region <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=http://jalbhagirathi.org/index.php|title=Home|date=2020-04-04|website=JBF|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. The organisation claims to harvest over 4000 million litres of water every year along with reclamation of 100+ hectares of barren land. <ref name=\":11\" /> The organisation also works actively with schools in the region, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to them. The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts. \n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\nThe innovative way of gathering rain in India is recharging the rain efficiently to underground water. In Banglore, two non-governmental organizations launched the program to dig the recharging wells and connect them with funnels to the underground water. Due to the organizations\u2019 claim the new recharging technique could collect 60 percent of water to the shallow aquifer.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====[[Desalination]]====\nDesalination is a potential advanced technique to solve the water shortage of the coastal region. In the past decades, Israel has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water to fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. Installing the new desalination plant near the coastal region could possibly fulfill the water needs of those coastal cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|last=Akhil Ramesh|first=Shenhav Ruttner|date=2019-10-31|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Improvement ====\nAs a country has 44% of the working population rely on agriculture, irrigation is an important water usage in India. <ref name=\":8\" /> In decades, the Indian Agriculture Institute kept promoting the drip irrigation technology to relieve the water scarcity in India. The drip irrigation technology has the advantage of being applicable to all regions in India. Furthermore, the drip irrigation could use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil.\n\nIn the past 15 years, with the government promotion, more agricultural lands started to implement with the drip irrigation. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n===[[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis 2019]]===\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry.

The crisis has especially worsened in the recent years due to [[climate change]] which results in delayed monsoons consequently drying out reservoirs in several regions. Other factors attributed to the shortage of water in India are a lack of proper infrastructure, government oversight and [[water pollution]].    \n\nThe acute shortage of water for daily needs has prompted many government and non government organisations to take stringent measures to combat the problem. The [[Government of India]] has launched multiple schemes and programs, including the formation of an entire \u2018[[Jan Shakti Party of India|Jal Shakti]]\u2019 Ministry to deal with the ongoing problem. The government has also insisted on techniques such as [[rainwater harvesting]], water conservation and more efficient [[irrigation]]. Agriculture alone is responsible for 80% of the country\u2019s water usage.<ref name=\":10\" /> \n\nSeveral large cities of India have experienced water shortages in recent years, with [[Chennai]] being the most prominent in 2019. The shortage of water affected the entire city of 9 million people and resulted in the closure of several hotels, restaurants and businesses. According to a report by the [[NITI Aayog|National Institution for Transforming India]] (NITI), at least 21 major Indian cities, including the capital [[New Delhi]] will completely run out of groundwater by 2020. The report also noted that approximately 200,000 people die in India each year due to the lack of access to safe drinking water. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/indias-water-crisis-bengaluru-delhi-chennai-hyderabad-among-21-cities-to-run-out-of-groundwater-by-2020-4590221.html|title=Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai among 21 cities to run out of groundwater by 2020- Technology News, Firstpost|date=2018-06-25|website=Tech2|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n=== People ===\nThe scarcity of water in India affects hundreds of millions of people across the country.

A lot of Indians are forced with the option of spending money to buy drinking water but the poor sections of the society are unable to afford it on a daily basis which creates a massive problem of water scarcity for the rural population of India. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/28/major-indian-city-runs-out-water-million-people-pray-rain/|title=As a major Indian city runs out of water, 9 million people pray for rain|last=Masih|first=Niha|last2=AsiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow|first2=closeNiha MasihForeign correspondent covering IndiaEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollowJoanna Slater closeJoanna SlaterForeign correspondent covering South|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nLimited accessibility to water is a threat to the people\u2019s health. Insufficient water has the capacity to deteriorate the health of an entire city in times of a water crisis. In the city of [[Latur]], the depletion of more than 90% of water sources resulted in a major health crisis and people were forced to dig borewells into the ground, exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals and risking contamination. Some local residents were forced to consume polluted water sources due to the crisis at hand. In June 2016, the count of health problems skyrocketed in Latur, with multiple people showing symptoms of fever, infection, dehydration, vomiting, and kidney ailments. In addition to this health crisis, hospitals were unable to safely perform any surgery due to the increased threat of post-operative infections and complications resulting from a lack of clean drinking water.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2019/jun/15/28-year-old-chennai-woman-stabbed-by-neighbour-over-water-dispute-1990355.html|title=28-year-old Chennai woman stabbed by neighbour over water dispute|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nA similar crisis emerged in [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai in 2019]] resulting in violent incidents and protests amongst the residents of the city.

The protests were in retaliation to the Supreme Court judgement which cancelled [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) quotas for them.  \n\nThe water crisis in India was also exacerbated by the emergence of the so-called water mafia or \u201ctanker mafia\u201d. Tanker mafia refers to private water tank owners who smuggle clean water illegally and sell it to local people at expensive prices. The tanker mafia is notorious in the city of Bhopal, where the mafia has been reported to bully poor residents and competing businesses, creating an atmosphere of social instability.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rajawat|first=Somya|date=06/21/2016|title=Drought and Water Security in India|url=http://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Drought-and-Water-Security-in-India.pdf|journal=Future Directions International|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ecosystem ===\nWater scarcity also threatens the lives of wild animals across India. Wild animals are forced to infiltrate villages and cities in India as they attempt to find potable water. In 2016, the city of [[Mettur]] and [[Kolathur]] experienced an acute water shortage caused by a drought, which caused water bodies in nearby forests to dry out.

Farmers are unable to produce crops in the absence of water. The drought in 2019 even destroyed the supplementary crops in addition to the winter crops. The scarcity of water has rendered a lot of valuable farmland in India completely useless and much of the farming industry in these regions has ceased to operate. In 2016, the city of [[Latur]] witnessed mass unemployment, where about half of its workforce was threatened to be unemployed as the agricultural industry struggled. Much of the local economy and farming regions nearly collapsed as the citizens were left with no choice but to use the polluted water. This implied reduced job opportunities in rural areas, which pushed citizens to move to the cities in search of jobs. Such a trend only adds pressure to the already strained infrastructure as the demand for water in large cities continues to increase.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Reasons for scarcity ==\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Monsoon]] is defined as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation. The North-East monsoon is responsible for 10%-20% rainfall of the total rainfall in India, while the South-West monsoon provides approximately 80% of rainfall. Therefore, the effects of climate change on the monsoon seasons is one of the important reasons for decrease in rainfall and water shortage in India. In recent years, monsoons in India have become more sporadic while also reducing in their length and hence reducing the total precipitation. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://impakter.com/water-scarcity-how-climate-crisis-is-unfolding-in-india/|title=Water Scarcity: How Climate Crisis is Unfolding in India|date=2019-09-18|website=Impakter|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the North-East monsoon decreased by 44% and the South-West monsoon was deficient by 10%. <ref name=\":1\" />The summer South-West monsoon that usually results in rainfall from the months of June till September was delayed for 10 days, causing the rainfall in the area to decrease by 36 percent in comparison to the 50-year average. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145242/water-shortages-in-india|title=Water Shortages in India|date=2019-06-27|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>Because of the lower rainfall, water levels in reservoirs across the country decreased and led to extreme shortages of water in many major cities of India. During the first half year of 2019, 91 major reservoirs in the country recorded a 32% drop in their water capacity, resulting in disasters such as the [[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis]]\n\n=== Infrastructure issues ===\n\n==== River pollution ====\nDue to the lack of a long-term water management plan, many of the country\u2019s rivers either run dry or have been polluted.

The traditional techniques of irrigation are also to blame for the water crisis as they result in a majority of water loss and evaporation during the irrigation process.\n\n==== Wastage of water ====\nAccording to the Central Water Commission, even though climate change has resulted in a reduction in rainfall and thereby the water supply, the country still receives enough rainfall to meet the needs of over 1 billion people. However, India only catches only 8 percent of its annual rainfall due to poor rainwater harvesting. Due to rapid urbanisation, a lot of the ponds used to capture water have been lost due to the rising population and inefficient implementation of city planning guidelines. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIndia has also been lacking in the treatment of wastewater for reuse. Approximately 80 percent of domestic wastewater is drained out as waste and ends up flowing into other water bodies which lead on to salt water sources such as the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the [[Arabian Sea]]. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Efforts ==\n=== Government efforts ===\nThe Government of India has reformed several of its departments and initiated several water supply projects in the last 3 years to respond to the country\u2019s growing water needs. <ref name=\":4\" /> The reforms include the establishment of a new ministry for water known as the Jal Shakti Ministry. The government also launched several projects in the main rivers and underground water sources. The Indian government has claimed that the new ministry and projects could increase the whole country\u2019s water use efficiency by 20% in addition to enhancing the capacity of its water reserves and protecting the currently over-exploited area.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://nwm.gov.in/|title=National Water Mission, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR, Government of India|website=nwm.gov.in|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Establish New Ministry Through Department Reorganization ====\nIn June 2019, Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] launched a new plan, \u201cPiped Water for All by 2024\u201d in order to integrate different water resources management departments together to take charge of the ground and surface water depletion. <ref name=\":4\" />The newly formed Jal Shakti ministry is responsible for publishing the policy guideline for water resources usage, regulating and leading the water resources related projects, and dealing with the cooperation, facilitation, and negotiation of water resources both internationally and in between states. <ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPrior to the formation of the [[Jan Shakti Party of India|Jal Shakti]] ministry, water resources in India were managed by different departments under the governance of either the local state government or the union government. The new ministry combines the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation with the former Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The government aims that this step will prevent various departments from conflicting and overlapping with each other. The Jal Shakti Ministry is responsible for managing the financial and technical resources, policy support and the pollution regulation deployment regarding the water resources throughout the country. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/can-ministry-of-jal-shakti-save-indian-rivers--65197|title=Can Ministry of Jal Shakti save Indian rivers?|website=www.downtoearth.org.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n====[[Ganges|Ganga River]] Cleaning Programs ====\nGanga, a popular holy river in India, feeds millions of people in North India. Despite the heavy reliance of public life on the river, it was named as one of the 10 most dangerous rivers in the world in 2007 due to water pollution. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/us-tv-host-takes-dig-at-ganges_587747.html|title=US TV host takes dig at Ganges|date=2009-12-16|website=Zee News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nThe first Ganga river cleaning program ([[Ganga Action Plan]]) was started in 1985 with an aim to tackle the problem of excessive water pollution in the river. The program led by government authority gradually expanded to look after the other rivers in India as well. Over the past 20 years, over \u00a3100m has been spent to mitigate the effect of industrial pollution on rivers and other water bodies. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/edit-page/Clean-Up-Or-Perish/articleshow/5699070.cms|title=Clean Up Or Perish - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> However, the Ganga Action Plan has not shown any signfificant results over the years. In 2018, the Central Pollution Control Board and National Green Tribunal of India reported that only 7% of the water region in Ganga River is drinkable and only about 10% of the water can be used for bathing.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nTo combat the problem of government incompetence in solving the water crisis, the Modi government announced that it will be launching new projects with more investment along with formulating new policies to manage the pollution in Ganga and other rivers in India. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/23/india-the-national-ganga-river-basin-project|title=The National Ganga River Basin Project|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/namami-gange-improved-water-quality-of-ganga-amit-shah-813327.html|title='Namami Gange' improved water quality of Ganga: Amit Shah|date=2020-03-13|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-governmental efforts ===\nIndia has a huge number of Non Government Organisations that focus on solving water shortage problems for the citizens in affected areas. Some of the organizations such as \u201cFORCE\u201d and \u201cSafe Water Network\u201d are actively involved in dealing with the water crisis in India.

They are actively involved in teaching the locals how to preserve the water resources and how to increase the water usage efficiency by installing new water gathering stations and improving their irrigation techniques. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classy.org/blog/nonprofits-address-global-water-crisis/|title=12 Nonprofits That Address the Global Water Crisis|date=2016-03-22|website=Classy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wearewater.org/en-IN/our-foundation_253356|title=Our foundation|website=We Are Water|language=en-IN|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n\u2018We are Water\u2019 publishes documentary films every year broadcasting the severe water scarcity in India to raise social awareness. In its documentaries, We are Water highlights the main reasons for water scarcity in the country and how each civilian can work towards conserving water in their own homes. These documents are especially relevant in rural areas as the residents don\u2019t have direct access to government schemes. \n\n==== Establishing Water Resources Projects ====\nIndia Non-governmental organizations generally will establish their distinctive water saving or water supply projects to support the water scarcity region. For example, with support from [[UNICEF|UNICEF,]] villagers in Palve Budruk, located in the drought-prone Parner Block in [[Ahmednagar]] district of [[Maharashtra]], developed a catchment plan covering 1,435 hectares \u2013 over 80% of the land available. The system has three check dams, 20 canal bunds, two small percolation tanks linked to the main tank and 19 village ponds. Water stored in the percolation tank, is strictly meant for domestic use only. Piped water is supplied for an hour a day in the morning, during which time families fill up water for drinking and cooking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/india/stories|title=Stories|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n===== Jal Bhagirathi Foundation =====\nThe Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is one of the most prominent non profit organisations in India dealing with the issues of water scarcity in the desert terrains of Rajasthan.

The organisation claims to harvest over 4000 million litres of water every year along with reclamation of 100+ hectares of barren land. <ref name=\":11\" /> The organisation also works actively with schools in the region, providing safe water and sanitation facilities to them. The Jal Bhagirathi Foundation is also actively involved in raising awareness about water conservation and has been awarded numerous awards for its efforts. \n\n=== Solutions and technologies ===\n\n==== Rain Collection ====\nThe innovative way of gathering rain in India is recharging the rain efficiently to underground water. In Banglore, two non-governmental organizations launched the program to dig the recharging wells and connect them with funnels to the underground water. Due to the organizations\u2019 claim the new recharging technique could collect 60 percent of water to the shallow aquifer.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====[[Desalination]]====\nDesalination is a potential advanced technique to solve the water shortage of the coastal region. In the past decades, Israel has already developed a systematic method to desalinate the sea water to fresh water for industrial and domestic usage. Installing the new desalination plant near the coastal region could possibly fulfill the water needs of those coastal cities such as Chennai. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/surviving-indias-water-crisis-92516|title=Surviving India's Water Crisis|last=Akhil Ramesh|first=Shenhav Ruttner|date=2019-10-31|website=The National Interest|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Irrigation Improvement ====\nAs a country has 44% of the working population rely on agriculture, irrigation is an important water usage in India. <ref name=\":8\" /> In decades, the Indian Agriculture Institute kept promoting the drip irrigation technology to relieve the water scarcity in India. The drip irrigation technology has the advantage of being applicable to all regions in India. Furthermore, the drip irrigation could use water more efficiently by modifying the water supply based on the moisture level of the soil.\n\nIn the past 15 years, with the government promotion, more agricultural lands started to implement with the drip irrigation. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iari.res.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200&Itemid=1247|title=Drip Irrigation Technology to save Water and Enhance Crop Yields|website=www.iari.res.in|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Current events ==\n\n===[[2019 Chennai water crisis|Chennai Water Crisis 2019]]===\nIn June 2019, the Indian city of [[Chennai]] faced an acute water shortage after its 4 main water reservoirs ran completely dry.
