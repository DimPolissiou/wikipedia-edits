It is charged with leading [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign-policy legislation]] and debate in the Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee is generally responsible for overseeing (but not administering) and funding [[Aid|foreign aid]] programs as well as funding arms sales and training for national allies. The committee is also responsible for holding [[Congressional hearing#Confirmation hearings|confirmation hearings]] for high-level positions in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The committee has considered, debated, and reported important treaties and legislation, ranging from the [[Alaska purchase]] in 1867 to the establishment of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. It also holds jurisdiction over all diplomatic nominations.<ref>[http://foreign.senate.gov/about/history/ History of the Committee]</ref> Along with the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committees]], the Foreign Relations Committee is one of the oldest in the Senate, going back to the initial creation of committees in 1816. Its sister committee in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] (renamed from International Relations by the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] in January 2007).\n\n==History==\n\nBetween 1887\u20131907, Alabama Democrat [[John Tyler Morgan]] played a leading role on the Committee. Morgan called for a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through Nicaragua, enlarging the merchant marine and the Navy, and acquiring Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba. He expected Latin American and Asian markets would become a new export market for Alabama's cotton, coal, iron, and timber. The canal would make trade with the Pacific much more feasible, and an enlarged military would protect that new trade. By 1905, most of his dreams had become reality, with the canal passing through Panama instead of Nicaragua.<ref>Joseph A. Fry, \"John Tyler Morgan's Southern Expansionism,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (1985) 9#4 pp: 329-346.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the committee took the lead in rejecting traditional isolationism and designing a new internationalist foreign policy based on the assumption that the United Nations would be a much more effective force than the old discredited League of Nations. Of special concern was the insistence that Congress play a central role in postwar foreign policy, as opposed to its ignorance of the main decisions made during the war.<ref>Roland Young, ''Congressional Politics in the Second World War'' (1958), pp 168\u201396</ref> Republican Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] played the central role. In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was made by British scholar [[Isaiah Berlin]] for the [[Foreign Office]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 |author=Hachey, Thomas E. |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973\u20131974 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013153 |jstor=4634869 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>James A.

William Fulbright]] (left) with Senator [[Wayne Morse]] during a hearing on the Vietnam War in 1966]]\nIn 1966, as tensions over the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, the Committee set up hearings on possible relations with Communist China. Witnesses, especially academic specialists on East Asia, suggested to the American public that it was time to adopt a new policy of containment without isolation. The hearings Indicated that American public opinion toward China had moved away from hostility and toward cooperation. The hearings had a long-term impact when Richard Nixon became president, discarded containment, and began a policy of d\u00e9tente with China.<ref>Katherine Klinefelter, \"The China Hearings: America's Shifting Paradigm on China,\" ''Congress & the Presidency'' (2011) 38#1 pp: 60-76.</ref>  The problem remained of how to deal simultaneously with the Chinese government on Taiwan after formal recognition was accorded to the Beijing government. The Committee drafted the Taiwan Relations Act (US, 1979) which enabled the United States both to maintain friendly relations with Taiwan and to develop fresh relations with China.<ref>Jacob K. Javits, \"Congress And Foreign Relations: The Taiwan Relations Act,\"  ''Foreign Affairs'' (1981) 60#1 pp 54-62</ref>\n\nIn response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners, [[President Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 nominated [[Ernest W. Lefever]] as [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|Assistant Secretary of State]]. Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations rejected his nomination by vote of 4-13, prompting Lefever to withdraw his name.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert David Johnson|title=Congress and the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYNTXxgcF8C&pg=PA254|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UO|pages=253\u201354}}</ref> [[Elliot Abrams]] filled the position.\n\nRepublican Senator [[Jesse Helms]], a staunch conservative, was Committee chairman in the late 1990s.

It is charged with leading [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign-policy legislation]] and debate in the Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee is generally responsible for overseeing (but not administering) and funding [[Aid|foreign aid]] programs as well as funding arms sales and training for national allies. The committee is also responsible for holding [[Congressional hearing#Confirmation hearings|confirmation hearings]] for high-level positions in the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. The committee has considered, debated, and reported important treaties and legislation, ranging from the [[Alaska purchase]] in 1867 to the establishment of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. It also holds jurisdiction over all diplomatic nominations.<ref>[http://foreign.senate.gov/about/history/ History of the Committee]</ref> Along with the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Finance]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committees]], the Foreign Relations Committee is one of the oldest in the Senate, going back to the initial creation of committees in 1816. Its sister committee in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] (renamed from International Relations by the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] in January 2007).\n\n==History==\n\nBetween 1887\u20131907, Alabama Democrat [[John Tyler Morgan]] played a leading role on the Committee. Morgan called for a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through Nicaragua, enlarging the merchant marine and the Navy, and acquiring Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba. He expected Latin American and Asian markets would become a new export market for Alabama's cotton, coal, iron, and timber. The canal would make trade with the Pacific much more feasible, and an enlarged military would protect that new trade. By 1905, most of his dreams had become reality, with the canal passing through Panama instead of Nicaragua.<ref>Joseph A. Fry, \"John Tyler Morgan's Southern Expansionism,\" ''Diplomatic History'' (1985) 9#4 pp: 329-346.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the committee took the lead in rejecting traditional isolationism and designing a new internationalist foreign policy based on the assumption that the United Nations would be a much more effective force than the old discredited League of Nations. Of special concern was the insistence that Congress play a central role in postwar foreign policy, as opposed to its ignorance of the main decisions made during the war.<ref>Roland Young, ''Congressional Politics in the Second World War'' (1958), pp 168\u201396</ref> Republican Senator [[Arthur Vandenberg]] played the central role. In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was made by British scholar [[Isaiah Berlin]] for the [[Foreign Office]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |title=American Profiles on Capitol Hill: A Confidential Study for the British Foreign Office in 1943 |author=Hachey, Thomas E. |journal=Wisconsin Magazine of History |date=Winter 1973\u20131974 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013153 |jstor=4634869 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021185357/http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/singles/bib139a/bib139a.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>James A.

William Fulbright]] (left) with Senator [[Wayne Morse]] during a hearing on the Vietnam War in 1966]]\nIn 1966, as tensions over the [[Vietnam War]] escalated, the Committee set up hearings on possible relations with Communist China. Witnesses, especially academic specialists on East Asia, suggested to the American public that it was time to adopt a new policy of containment without isolation. The hearings Indicated that American public opinion toward China had moved away from hostility and toward cooperation. The hearings had a long-term impact when Richard Nixon became president, discarded containment, and began a policy of d\u00e9tente with China.<ref>Katherine Klinefelter, \"The China Hearings: America's Shifting Paradigm on China,\" ''Congress & the Presidency'' (2011) 38#1 pp: 60-76.</ref>  The problem remained of how to deal simultaneously with the Chinese government on Taiwan after formal recognition was accorded to the Beijing government. The Committee drafted the Taiwan Relations Act (US, 1979) which enabled the United States both to maintain friendly relations with Taiwan and to develop fresh relations with China.<ref>Jacob K. Javits, \"Congress And Foreign Relations: The Taiwan Relations Act,\"  ''Foreign Affairs'' (1981) 60#1 pp 54-62</ref>\n\nIn response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners, [[President Ronald Reagan]] in 1981 nominated [[Ernest W. Lefever]] as [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|Assistant Secretary of State]]. Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations rejected his nomination by vote of 4-13, prompting Lefever to withdraw his name.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert David Johnson|title=Congress and the Cold War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEYNTXxgcF8C&pg=PA254|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UO|pages=253\u201354}}</ref> [[Elliot Abrams]] filled the position.\n\nRepublican Senator [[Jesse Helms]], a staunch conservative, was Committee chairman in the late 1990s.

The mysterious pursuer flashes his [[headlamp|high beams]], [[tailgating|tailgates]] her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a [[murderer]], or escaped [[mental patient]]) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, causing him to duck back down.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bronner |first= Simon J. |title= American Children's Folklore |url= https://archive.org/details/americanchildren00bron |url-access= registration |authorlink= Simon J.

Inside the station, he asks if she knows there's a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', \"[[The Pest House]]\".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.\n\nIn another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. The woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazed person appears and attacks the car. The woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. The police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). But when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver's seat. As it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer's victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer.\n\n==Origin==\nThe story has been identified as circulating at least as early as the late 1960s, and may have gained more widespread recognition after appearing in a letter to [[Advice column|advice columnist]] [[Ann Landers]] in 1982.<ref name=snopes>{{cite web | url = https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/ | title = The Killer in the Backseat: A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station. | last = Mikkelson | first = David | date = 26 September 2000 | website = snopes.com | access-date = 11 July 2019}}</ref> It has been speculated, including by [[Snopes]] founder David Mikkelson, that the legend may have been inspired by a vaguely similar case which took place in 1964, in which an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car, only to end up shot by the car's owner, a police detective.<ref name=snopes/> Other somewhat similar, though not identical, cases have since been noted, including by folklorist [[Jan Harold Brunvand]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.deseretnews.com/article/199359/TALE-OF-BACKSEAT-KILLER-IS-SIMILAR-TO-NEWS-STORIES.html | title = TALE OF BACKSEAT KILLER IS SIMILAR TO NEWS STORIES | last = Brunvand | first = Jan Harold | date = 13 December 1991 | website = desertnews.com | access-date = 11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\nThe story is often told with a moral. The attendant is often a [[lumberjack]], a [[truck driver|trucker]], or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. She assumes it is the attendant who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life.<ref>{{cite book |last= Barden |first= Thomas E. |title= Virginia Folk Legends |url= https://archive.org/details/virginiafolklege00bard |url-access= registration |location= Charlottesville, VA |publisher= University Press of Virginia |year= 1991 |page= [https://archive.org/details/virginiafolklege00bard/page/324 324] |ISBN= 978-08139-133-5-3 |quote= The story structure of a suspected harmer turning out to be a savior appears in such modern legends as that of the truck driver following a woman home flashing his lights.

Inside the station, he asks if she knows there's a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', \"[[The Pest House]]\".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.\n\nIn another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. The woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazed person appears and attacks the car. The woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. The police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). But when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver's seat. As it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer's victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer.\n\n==Origin==\nThe story has been identified as circulating at least as early as the late 1960s, and may have gained more widespread recognition after appearing in a letter to [[Advice column|advice columnist]] [[Ann Landers]] in 1982.<ref name=snopes>{{cite web | url = https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-killer-in-the-backseat/ | title = The Killer in the Backseat: A crazed killer is discovered hiding in the back seat of woman's car at a gas station. | last = Mikkelson | first = David | date = 26 September 2000 | website = snopes.com | access-date = 11 July 2019}}</ref> It has been speculated, including by [[Snopes]] founder David Mikkelson, that the legend may have been inspired by a vaguely similar case which took place in 1964, in which an escaped murderer hid in the backseat of a car, only to end up shot by the car's owner, a police detective.<ref name=snopes/> Other somewhat similar, though not identical, cases have since been noted, including by folklorist [[Jan Harold Brunvand]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.deseretnews.com/article/199359/TALE-OF-BACKSEAT-KILLER-IS-SIMILAR-TO-NEWS-STORIES.html | title = TALE OF BACKSEAT KILLER IS SIMILAR TO NEWS STORIES | last = Brunvand | first = Jan Harold | date = 13 December 1991 | website = desertnews.com | access-date = 11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\nThe story is often told with a moral. The attendant is often a [[lumberjack]], a [[truck driver|trucker]], or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason.

It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the [[Alps]]. The Rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] divide the basin roughly in half. It extends roughly between [[Vienna]] in the northwest, [[Ko\u0161ice]] in the northeast, [[Zagreb]] in the southwest, [[Novi Sad]] in the south and [[Satu Mare]] in the east.\n\nIn terms of modern state boundaries, the basin centres on the territory of [[Hungary]], but it also covers regions of western [[Slovakia]] (the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]]), southeastern [[Poland]], western [[Ukraine]], western [[Romania]], northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), the tip of northeast [[Croatia]] ([[Slavonia]]), northeastern [[Slovenia]], and eastern [[Austria]]. The name \"Pannonian\" comes from [[Pannonia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]]. Only the western part of the territory (the so-called [[Transdanubia]]) of modern Hungary formed part of the ancient Roman Province of Pannonia; this comprises less than 29% of modern Hungary, therefore Hungarian geographers avoid the terms \"Pannonian Basin\" and \"Pannonian Plain\".\n\n==Terminology==\nIn English-language, the terms \"Pannonian Basin\" and \"Carpathian Basin\" are used synonymously. The name \"Pannonian\" is taken from that of [[Pannonia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]]. The historical province overlapped but was not coterminous with the geographical plain or basin. [[Pannonia Inferior]] covered much of the western half of the basin, as far as the [[Danube]]. [[Pannonia Superior]] included the western fringe of the basin as well as part of the [[Eastern Alps]], as far as [[Virunum]]. The southern fringe of the basin was in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Moesia]]. The eastern half of the basin was not conquered by the Romans and was considered part of [[Sarmatia]], inhabited by the [[Iazyges]]. Likewise, the parts north of the Danube (now in western Slovakia) were not in the empire; they were considered part of [[Germania]], inhabited by the [[Quadi]].\n\nThe term ''Pannonian Plain'' refers to the lowland parts of the Pannonian Basin as well as those of some adjoining regions like [[Lower Austria]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] ([[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]]). The lands adjoining the plain proper are sometimes also called ''peri-Pannonian''.\n\nThe term ''Carpathian Basin'' is used in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] literature, while the [[West Slavic languages]] ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]), [[Serbo-Croatian languages]], [[German language]], and [[Romanian language]] use ''Pannonian'': in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the basin is known as ''K\u00e1rp\u00e1t-medence'', in [[Czech language|Czech]]; ''Panonsk\u00e1 p\u00e1nev'', in [[Polish language|Polish]]; ''Pano\u0144ski Basen'', in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]; ''Pan\u00f3nska panva'', in [[Serbo-Croatian]]: ''Panonski bazen''/\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043d, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]; ''Panonski bazen'', in [[German language|German]]; ''Pannonisches Becken'', and in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; ''C\u00e2mpia Panonic\u0103'' or ''Bazinul Panonic''. The [[East Slavic languages]], namely [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], use terms ''Tisa-Danube Basin'' or ''Middanubian Basin'' ({{lang-uk|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u043e-\u0414\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430}})\n\nIn Hungarian geographical literature various subdivisions of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] ([[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Western Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Eastern Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Southern Carpathians]], [[Western Carpathians]] and [[Transylvanian Plateau]]) are also considered parts of the Carpathian Basin on the basis of traditional geopolitical divisions.\n\n==Name==\n{{further|Pannonii}}\n[[Julius Pokorny]] derived the name ''Pannonia'' from [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*pen-'', \"swamp, water, wet\" (cf.

Various different peoples inhabited the plain during its history. In the first century BC, the eastern parts of the plain belonged to the [[Dacia]]n state, and in the first century AD its western parts were subsumed into the [[Roman Empire]]. The Roman province named [[Pannonia]] was established in the area, and the city of [[Sirmium]], today [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]], became one of the four capital cities of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the [[Age of Migrations]] and the early [[Middle Ages]], the region belonged to several realms such as the [[Hunnic Empire|Hun Empire]], the [[Kingdom of the Gepids]], the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]], the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], the [[Avar Khaganate]], the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Samo's Empire|state of Samo]], the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], [[Great Moravia]], the [[Balaton Principality]], the Pannonian Principality and the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]].\n\nThe [[Principality of Hungary]] established in 895 by the [[Magyars]] and neighboring [[West Slavs]] was centred on the plain and included almost all of it (as did the former [[Avar Khaganate|Avar Kingdom]]). It was established as the [[Christianity|Catholic]] [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in AD 1000, with the coronation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]].\n[[File:Pusztai p\u00e1sztorok.jpg|thumb|210px|Cattle shepherds in the puszta of Hungary, c. 1852]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary]] by the 11th century comprised the entire Pannonian basin, but the changing fates of this part of Europe during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] of the 14th to 17th centuries left the Pannonian basin divided between numerous political entities. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the central and eastern regions of the kingdom and the plain on which they lay were incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the remainder to the north-west was subsumed into the holdings of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and retitled [[Royal Hungary]]. Under Ottoman administration, the plain was reorganised into the [[Eyalet of Budim]], the [[Eyalet of Egri]], the [[Eyalet of Sigetvar]] and the [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]].\n\n===Modern history===\nThe Pannonian Plain was frequently a scene of conflict between the two empires. At the end of the 17th century the [[Habsburgs]] won decisive battles against the [[Ottomans]], and most of the plain gradually came under Habsburg rule. Under Habsburg rule the region was eventually reorganised into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Banat of Temeswar]], the [[Military Frontier]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]].\n\nThe Habsburg Monarchy was subsequently transformed into the [[Austrian Empire]] (in 1804) and later became [[Austria-Hungary]] (in 1867). Most of the plain was located within the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary, since all other Habsburg possessions in the plain were integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary until 1882. The autonomous Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which was one of the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], comprised the south-western portion of the plain.\n\nWith the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I, the region was divided between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[German Austria|Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1929). The borders drawn in 1918 and 1919 are mostly preserved as those of the contemporary states of [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Croatia]],\nand [[Romania]].\n\n==Major cities==\nThis is a list of cities in the Pannonian Basin with a population larger than 100,000 within the [[city proper]]:\n*[[Budapest]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (1,750,268) {{increase}}\n*[[Belgrade]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (1,166,763) {{increase}}\n*[[Zagreb]] {{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Croatia]] (812,635) {{increase}}\n*[[Bratislava]] {{flagicon|Slovakia}} [[Slovakia]] (546,300) {{increase}}\n*[[Timi\u0219oara]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (319,279 ) {{increase}}\n*[[Novi Sad]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (277,522) {{increase}}\n*[[Graz]] {{flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]] (265,778) {{increase}}\n*[[Ko\u0161ice]] {{flagicon|Slovakia}} [[Slovakia]] (240,688) {{increase}}\n*[[Debrecen]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (204,333) {{decrease}}\n*[[Oradea]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (196,367) {{decrease}}\n*[[Miskolc]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (162,905) {{decrease}}\n*[[Szeged]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (161,837) {{decrease}}\n*[[Arad, Romania|Arad]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (159,704) {{decrease}}\n*[[P\u00e9cs]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (147,719) {{decrease}}\n*[[Gy\u0151r]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (128,567) {{decrease}}\n*[[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (118,185) {{decrease}}\n*[[Uzhhorod]] {{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Ukraine]] (115,163) {{decrease}}\n*[[Kecskem\u00e9t]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (111,863) {{increase}}\n*[[Subotica]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (105,681) {{decrease}}\n*[[Satu Mare]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (102,441) {{decrease}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geography of Europe]]\n*[[Central Europe]]\n*[[Pannonian Biogeographic Region]]\n*[[Pannonian Sea]]\n*[[Transdanubian Mountains]]\n*[[Pelso unit]]\n*[[Tisza unit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portalbar|Europe}}\n{{Commons category-inline|Pannonian Basin}}\n*[http://mek.oszk.hu/00000/00093/index.phtml Zentai L\u00e1szl\u00f3's account of the Basin formation] In Hungarian.\n*[http://www.sci.u-szeged.hu/ABS/Acta%20HP/44-75.pdf Anthropological sketch of the prehistoric population]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211073956/http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/research/koros/overview/arch_background/arch_background.html K\u00f6r\u00f6s Regional Archaeological Project]: Neolithic and Copper Age archaeology in the Pannonian plain\n\n{{coord|46.5|N|20|E|source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Pannonian Plain]]\n[[Category:Aulacogens]]\n[[Category:Basins of Europe]]\n[[Category:Structural basins]]\n[[Category:Sedimentary basins of Europe]]\n[[Category:Back-arc basins]]\n[[Category:Geology of Austria]]\n[[Category:Geology of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Geology of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Geology of the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Geology of Europe]]\n[[Category:Geology of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Geology of Poland]]\n[[Category:Geology of Romania]]\n[[Category:Geology of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Geology of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Structural basins of Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Geology of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Lower Austria]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Landforms of the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Europe]]\n[[Category:Plains of Austria]]\n[[Category:Plains of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Plains of Romania]]\n[[Category:Plains of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Geography of Vojvodina]]\n[[Category:Banat]]\n[[Category:Ba\u010dka]]\n[[Category:Syrmia]]\n[[Category:Pannonia]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Pannonian Basin.svg|right|thumb|200px|The Pannonian Basin (marked III.), enclosed by the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] and the [[Transylvanian Plateau]] (IV.) to the east and north.

It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and the [[Alps]]. The Rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] divide the basin roughly in half. It extends roughly between [[Vienna]] in the northwest, [[Ko\u0161ice]] in the northeast, [[Zagreb]] in the southwest, [[Novi Sad]] in the south and [[Satu Mare]] in the east.\n\nIn terms of modern state boundaries, the basin centres on the territory of [[Hungary]], but it also covers regions of western [[Slovakia]] (the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]]), southeastern [[Poland]], western [[Ukraine]], western [[Romania]], northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), the tip of northeast [[Croatia]] ([[Slavonia]]), northeastern [[Slovenia]], and eastern [[Austria]]. The name \"Pannonian\" comes from [[Pannonia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]]. Only the western part of the territory (the so-called [[Transdanubia]]) of modern Hungary formed part of the ancient Roman Province of Pannonia; this comprises less than 29% of modern Hungary, therefore Hungarian geographers avoid the terms \"Pannonian Basin\" and \"Pannonian Plain\".\n\n==Terminology==\nIn English-language, the terms \"Pannonian Basin\" and \"Carpathian Basin\" are used synonymously. The name \"Pannonian\" is taken from that of [[Pannonia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]]. The historical province overlapped but was not coterminous with the geographical plain or basin. [[Pannonia Inferior]] covered much of the western half of the basin, as far as the [[Danube]]. [[Pannonia Superior]] included the western fringe of the basin as well as part of the [[Eastern Alps]], as far as [[Virunum]]. The southern fringe of the basin was in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Moesia]]. The eastern half of the basin was not conquered by the Romans and was considered part of [[Sarmatia]], inhabited by the [[Iazyges]]. Likewise, the parts north of the Danube (now in western Slovakia) were not in the empire; they were considered part of [[Germania]], inhabited by the [[Quadi]].\n\nThe term ''Pannonian Plain'' refers to the lowland parts of the Pannonian Basin as well as those of some adjoining regions like [[Lower Austria]], [[Moravia]], and [[Silesia]] ([[Czech Republic]] and [[Poland]]). The lands adjoining the plain proper are sometimes also called ''peri-Pannonian''.\n\nThe term ''Carpathian Basin'' is used in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] literature, while the [[West Slavic languages]] ([[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]), [[Serbo-Croatian languages]], [[German language]], and [[Romanian language]] use ''Pannonian'': in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] the basin is known as ''K\u00e1rp\u00e1t-medence'', in [[Czech language|Czech]]; ''Panonsk\u00e1 p\u00e1nve'', in [[Polish language|Polish]]; ''Pano\u0144ski Basen'', in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]; ''Pan\u00f3nska panva'', in [[Serbo-Croatian]]: ''Panonski bazen''/\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043d, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]]; ''Panonski bazen'', in [[German language|German]]; ''Pannonisches Becken'', and in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; ''C\u00e2mpia Panonic\u0103'' or ''Bazinul Panonic''. The [[East Slavic languages]], namely [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], use terms ''Tisa-Danube Basin'' or ''Middanubian Basin'' ({{lang-uk|\u0422\u0438\u0441\u043e-\u0414\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430}})\n\nIn Hungarian geographical literature various subdivisions of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] ([[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Western Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Eastern Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Southern Carpathians]], [[Western Carpathians]] and [[Transylvanian Plateau]]) are also considered parts of the Carpathian Basin on the basis of traditional geopolitical divisions.\n\n==Name==\n{{further|Pannonii}}\n[[Julius Pokorny]] derived the name ''Pannonia'' from [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*pen-'', \"swamp, water, wet\" (cf.

The Roman province named [[Pannonia]] was established in the area, and the city of [[Sirmium]], today [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]], became one of the four capital cities of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the [[Age of Migrations]] and the early [[Middle Ages]], the region belonged to several realms such as the [[Hunnic Empire|Hun Empire]], the [[Kingdom of the Gepids]], the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]], the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], the [[Avar Khaganate]], the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Samo's Empire|state of Samo]], the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], [[Great Moravia]], the [[Balaton Principality]], the Pannonian Principality and the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]].\n\nThe [[Principality of Hungary]] established in 895 by the [[Magyars]] and neighboring [[West Slavs]] was centred on the plain and included almost all of it (as did the former [[Avar Khaganate|Avar Kingdom]]). It was established as the [[Christianity|Catholic]] [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in AD 1000, with the coronation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]].\n[[File:Pusztai p\u00e1sztorok.jpg|thumb|210px|Cattle shepherds in the puszta of Hungary, c. 1852]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary]] by the 11th century comprised the entire Pannonian basin, but the changing fates of this part of Europe during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] of the 14th to 17th centuries left the Pannonian basin divided between numerous political entities. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the central and eastern regions of the kingdom and the plain on which they lay were incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the remainder to the north-west was subsumed into the holdings of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and retitled [[Royal Hungary]]. Under Ottoman administration, the plain was reorganised into the [[Eyalet of Budim]], the [[Eyalet of Egri]], the [[Eyalet of Sigetvar]] and the [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of Teme\u015fvar]].\n\n===Modern history===\nThe Pannonian Plain was frequently a scene of conflict between the two empires. At the end of the 17th century the [[Habsburgs]] won decisive battles against the [[Ottomans]], and most of the plain gradually came under Habsburg rule. Under Habsburg rule the region was eventually reorganised into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Banat of Temeswar]], the [[Military Frontier]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat]].\n\nThe Habsburg Monarchy was subsequently transformed into the [[Austrian Empire]] (in 1804) and later became [[Austria-Hungary]] (in 1867). Most of the plain was located within the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary, since all other Habsburg possessions in the plain were integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary until 1882. The autonomous Kingdom of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], which was one of the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], comprised the south-western portion of the plain.\n\nWith the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I, the region was divided between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[German Austria|Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1929). The borders drawn in 1918 and 1919 are mostly preserved as those of the contemporary states of [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Croatia]],\nand [[Romania]].\n\n==Major cities==\nThis is a list of cities in the Pannonian Basin with a population larger than 100,000 within the [[city proper]]:\n*[[Budapest]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (1,750,268) {{increase}}\n*[[Belgrade]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (1,166,763) {{increase}}\n*[[Zagreb]] {{flagicon|Croatia}} [[Croatia]] (812,635) {{increase}}\n*[[Bratislava]] {{flagicon|Slovakia}} [[Slovakia]] (546,300) {{increase}}\n*[[Timi\u0219oara]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (319,279 ) {{increase}}\n*[[Novi Sad]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (277,522) {{increase}}\n*[[Graz]] {{flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]] (265,778) {{increase}}\n*[[Ko\u0161ice]] {{flagicon|Slovakia}} [[Slovakia]] (240,688) {{increase}}\n*[[Debrecen]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (204,333) {{decrease}}\n*[[Oradea]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (196,367) {{decrease}}\n*[[Miskolc]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (162,905) {{decrease}}\n*[[Szeged]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (161,837) {{decrease}}\n*[[Arad, Romania|Arad]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (159,704) {{decrease}}\n*[[P\u00e9cs]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (147,719) {{decrease}}\n*[[Gy\u0151r]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (128,567) {{decrease}}\n*[[Ny\u00edregyh\u00e1za]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (118,185) {{decrease}}\n*[[Uzhhorod]] {{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Ukraine]] (115,163) {{decrease}}\n*[[Kecskem\u00e9t]] {{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Hungary]] (111,863) {{increase}}\n*[[Subotica]] {{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Serbia]] (105,681) {{decrease}}\n*[[Satu Mare]] {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Romania]] (102,441) {{decrease}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Geography of Europe]]\n*[[Central Europe]]\n*[[Pannonian Biogeographic Region]]\n*[[Pannonian Sea]]\n*[[Transdanubian Mountains]]\n*[[Pelso unit]]\n*[[Tisza unit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portalbar|Europe}}\n{{Commons category-inline|Pannonian Basin}}\n*[http://mek.oszk.hu/00000/00093/index.phtml Zentai L\u00e1szl\u00f3's account of the Basin formation] In Hungarian.\n*[http://www.sci.u-szeged.hu/ABS/Acta%20HP/44-75.pdf Anthropological sketch of the prehistoric population]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211073956/http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/research/koros/overview/arch_background/arch_background.html K\u00f6r\u00f6s Regional Archaeological Project]: Neolithic and Copper Age archaeology in the Pannonian plain\n\n{{coord|46.5|N|20|E|source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Pannonian Plain]]\n[[Category:Aulacogens]]\n[[Category:Basins of Europe]]\n[[Category:Structural basins]]\n[[Category:Sedimentary basins of Europe]]\n[[Category:Back-arc basins]]\n[[Category:Geology of Austria]]\n[[Category:Geology of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Geology of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Geology of the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Geology of Europe]]\n[[Category:Geology of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Geology of Poland]]\n[[Category:Geology of Romania]]\n[[Category:Geology of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Geology of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Structural basins of Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Geology of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Lower Austria]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Landforms of the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Slovenia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Europe]]\n[[Category:Plains of Austria]]\n[[Category:Plains of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Plains of Romania]]\n[[Category:Plains of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Slovakia]]\n[[Category:Plains of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Geography of Vojvodina]]\n[[Category:Banat]]\n[[Category:Ba\u010dka]]\n[[Category:Syrmia]]\n[[Category:Pannonia]]\n", "name_user": "Mandevil", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix Czech name for the Pannonian Basin", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Basin"}

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition.

Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.<ref name=\"mmajunkie.com\"/>  In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).
