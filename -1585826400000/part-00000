Expert systems are designed to mimic human experts; they typically draw from a deep database of information. Intelligent agent computer systems, in contrast, learn from interacting with an environment. The merger between human and computer destabilizes ''ethos'' according to Miller.

Paleo-reconstruction methods were used on several archives, including [[foraminifera]] and deep-sea corals, to determine the past variability in ocean chemistry and to tie these to present-day chemical and biological observations;\n# Theme 2 studied the sensitivity of marine organisms, communities and [[ecosystem]]s to ocean acidification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Key climate-relevant [[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] processes such as [[calcification]], [[primary production]] and [[nitrogen fixation]] were investigated using a large array of techniques, ranging from molecular tools to physiological and ecological approaches.                                                 Perturbation experiments were carried out both in the laboratory and in the field, including a major large-scale offshore [[mesocosm]] experiment in Svalbard in 2010 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Arctic ocean acidification: pelagic ecosystem and biogeochemical responses during a mesocosm study.|url=https://www.biogeosciences.net/special_issue120.html|journal=Biogeosciences|issue=Special Issue|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n# Theme 3 focused on the integration of the results from Themes 1 and 2 in biogeochemical, [[sediment]], and coupled ocean-climate models to better understand and project the responses of the Earth system to ocean acidification.                                                                                      Special attention was paid to feedbacks of physiological changes on the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron cycles and how these changes will affect and be affected by future [[climate change]];\n# Finally, Theme 4 synthesized the results from Themes 1-3 and assessed uncertainties, risks and thresholds (\"tipping points\") related to ocean acidification at scales ranging from subcellular to ecosystem and local to global scales.

Paleo-reconstruction methods were used on several archives, including [[foraminifera]] and deep-sea corals, to determine the past variability in ocean chemistry and to tie these to present-day chemical and biological observations;\n# Theme 2 studied the sensitivity of marine organisms, communities and [[ecosystem]]s to ocean acidification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Key climate-relevant [[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] processes such as [[calcification]], [[primary production]] and [[nitrogen fixation]] were investigated using a large array of techniques, ranging from molecular tools to physiological and ecological approaches.                                                 Perturbation experiments were carried out both in the laboratory and in the field, including a major large-scale offshore [[mesocosm]] experiment in Svalbard in 2010 <ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Arctic ocean acidification: pelagic ecosystem and biogeochemical responses during a mesocosm study.|url=https://www.biogeosciences.net/special_issue120.html|journal=Biogeosciences|issue=Special Issue|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n# Theme 3 focused on the integration of the results from Themes 1 and 2 in biogeochemical, [[sediment]], and coupled ocean-climate models to better understand and project the responses of the Earth system to ocean acidification.                                                                                      Special attention was paid to feedbacks of physiological changes on the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron cycles and how these changes will affect and be affected by future [[climate change]];\n# Finally, Theme 4 synthesized the results from Themes 1-3 and assessed uncertainties, risks and thresholds (\"tipping points\") related to ocean acidification at scales ranging from subcellular to ecosystem and local to global scales.

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US. The magnitude of the plume was such that NASA researcher Christian Frankenberg reported to the press that, \"We couldn\u2019t be sure that the signal was real.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/12/30/2500-square-mile-methane-plume-silently-hovering-over-western-us | title=A 2,500 Square-Mile Methane Plume is Silently Hovering over Western US}}</ref> According to NASA: \"The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet.

If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year. This reduction would be accomplished primarily through capturing natural gas that escapes into the air, and making it available for sale.

The group also raises a federal policy issue, namely whether fracturing fluids should continue to be exempt from Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. This exemption was an informal one until 2005, when it was codified as part of the Energy Policy Act.

1987, researchers at the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) expressed concern that hydraulic fracturing might contaminate groundwater.<ref name=\"Urbina 03Aug2011\"/> With the growth of [[hydraulic fracturing in the United States]] in the following years, concern grew. \"Public exposure to the many chemicals involved in energy development is expected to increase over the next few years, with uncertain consequences\" wrote science writer Valerie Brown in 2007.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/> It wasn't until 2010 that Congress asked the EPA to conduct a full study of the environmental impact of fracking.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/03/04/us/20110304-gas-documents3.html#document/p442/a10384</ref> The study is ongoing, but the EPA released a progress

There is a 2,500 square-mile methane plume hovering over the Four Corners area of the western US. The magnitude of the plume was such that NASA researcher Christian Frankenberg reported to the press that, \"We couldn\u2019t be sure that the signal was real.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/12/30/2500-square-mile-methane-plume-silently-hovering-over-western-us | title=A 2,500 Square-Mile Methane Plume is Silently Hovering over Western US}}</ref> According to NASA: \"The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country.\"<ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/09oct_methanehotspot/ U.S. METHANE 'HOT SPOT' BIGGER THAN EXPECTED] NASA, 9 Oct. 2014.</ref>\n\nOther concerns are related to emissions from the hydraulic fracturing chemicals and equipment such as [[volatile organic compound]] (VOC) and [[ozone]].  In 2008, ozone concentrations in [[ambient air]] near drilling sites in [[Sublette County, Wyoming]] were frequently above the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) of 75&nbsp;ppb<ref name=tribOzoneWyoming/> and have been recorded as high as 125&nbsp;ppb.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In [[DISH, Texas]], elevated levels of [[disulfide]]s, [[benzene]], [[xylene]]s and [[naphthalene]] have been detected in the air, emitted from compressor stations.<ref name=\"DISH TX SciAm\"/>  In [[Garfield County, Colorado]], an area with a high concentration of drilling rigs, VOC emissions increased 30% between 2004 and 2006.<ref name=\"HeatOnGas\"/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of Michigan]] analyzed the emissions produced from the hydraulic fracturing equipment at the [[Marcellus Shale]] and [[Eagle Ford Shale]] plays, and concluded that hydraulic pumps accounted for about 83% of the total emissions in the hydraulic fracturing fleet. [[NOx]] emission ranged between 3,600\u20135,600&nbsp;lb/job, [[hydrocarbon|HC]] 232\u2013289&nbsp;lb/job, [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] 859\u20131416&nbsp;lb/job, and [[Particulate matter|PM]] 184\u2013310&nbsp;lb/job. If the fuel efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing pumps are improved, the emissions can be reduced.<ref name=\"Air Emissions UMICH\"/>\n\nOn April 17, 2012, the EPA issued cost-effective regulations, required by the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], which include the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured.<ref name=\"epa-airquality\"/>  The final rules are expected to yield a nearly 95% reduction in VOC emissions from more than 11,000&nbsp;new hydraulically fractured gas wells each year.

Methane leakage rates were measured, and extrapolations over all the expected orphaned wells in the state indicated that the old wells made up a significant source of methane.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=Mary |last2=Kanno |first2=Cynthia M. |last3=Reid |first3=Matthew C. |last4=Zhang |first4=Xin |last5=Mauzerall |first5=Denise L. |last6=Celia |first6=Michael A. |last7=Chen |first7=Yuheng |last8=Onstott |first8=Tullis C. |title=Direct measurements of methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells in Pennsylvania |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=23 December 2014 |volume=111 |issue=51 |pages=18173\u201318177 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1408315111 |pmid=25489074 |pmc=4280601 |bibcode=2014PNAS..11118173K }}</ref> A 2019 study explores the long-term (>\u202f30\u202fyears) flow and transport of fracturing fluids into overburden layers and groundwater aquifers through a leaky abandoned well.

A major difficulty in proving or disproving contamination in previous cases has been the lack of a baseline sample for the water supply in question. The group also raises a federal policy issue, namely whether fracturing fluids should continue to be exempt from Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. This exemption was an informal one until 2005, when it was codified as part of the Energy Policy Act. A consequence of this exemption is that drilling companies are not required to disclose the chemicals that make up the fracturing fluids, making testing for these chemicals in ground water more difficult.|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-21\">{{cite web |url=http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |last=Mall |first=Amy |work=Switchboard: NRDC Staff Blog |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |title=Incidents where hydraulic fracturing is a suspected cause of drinking water contamination |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222025433/http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/amall/incidents_where_hydraulic_frac.html |archive-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-36\">{{cite web |url= http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories/10132/3830 |title= How is hydraulic fracturing related to earthquakes and tremors? |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |accessdate= 4 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019024105/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/?q=categories%2F10132%2F3830 |archive-date= 19 October 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AutoZV-37\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/news-events/seismologists-link-ohio-earthquakes-waste-disposal-wells |title=Ohio Quakes Probably Triggered by Waste Disposal Well, Say Seismologists |date=6 January 2012 |publisher=[[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bateman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/06/fracking-in-pennsylvania-201006 |title=A Colossal Fracking Mess |author=Christopher Bateman |date=21 June 2010 |publisher=VanityFair.com |accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 10.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-10/pennsylvania-fracking-foes-fault-epa-over-tainted-water-response.html |title=Pennsylvania Fracking Foes Fault EPA Over Tainted Water Response |author=Jim Snyder |author2=Mark Drajem |date=10 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg 11.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-11/fracking-s-political-support-unshaken-by-doctors-call-for-ban.html |title=Fracking Political Support Unshaken by Doctors' Call for Ban |author=Mark Drajem |date=11 January 2012 |agency=Bloomberg |accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BusinessIn10092013\" >{{cite news |url =http://www.businessinsider.com/fracking-leaving-radioactive-pollution-in-pa-2013-10|title=Duke Study: Fracking Is Leaving Radioactive Pollution In Pennsylvania Rivers|work= Business Insider | first =Harrison |last=Jacobs |date=9 October 2013 |publisher= [[Business Insider]] | accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BW 19.01.2012\">{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/like-fracking-youll-love-super-fracking-01192012.html |title=Like Fracking?

These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even [[melon]] consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/> The coexistence of erythromelalgia and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berlin AL, Pehr K |title=Coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon |journal=J.

In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.\n\n==Cause==\n[[File:Erythromelalgia-symptoms.jpg|thumb|Toes during an EM flareup]]\nIn general, erythromelalgia seems to consist of [[neuropathology|neuropathological]] and [[capillary|microvascular]] alterations. How this occurs in secondary erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that have been shown to elicit erythromelalgia are listed in [[erythromelalgia#Diagnosis|diagnosis]], below.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n\nPrimary erythromelalgia is a better understood [[autosomal dominant]] disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of [[group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] in the [[dorsal root ganglion]]. Specifically, [[nociceptor]]s (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) appear to be the primarily affected neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The [[sympathetic nervous system]] controls [[cutaneous]] [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular]] [[muscle tone|tone]] and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the [[sodium channel]] [[Nav1.7|Na<sub>V</sub>1.7]]. These differences in excitability alterations between the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and [[nociceptor]]s is due to different expression of [[sodium channel]]s other than Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in them.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n\nWhat causes epidemic erythromelalgia in southern China remains unknown although several erythromelalgia-associated poxviruses were isolated from throat swabs of several patients at different counties and two different seasons.<ref name=\"Zheng\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(88)90372-8 | last1 = Zheng | first1 = Z.

This section pertains solely to primary erythromelalgia as the secondary form is too poorly understood.''\n\nThere are 10 known mutations in the voltage-gated [[sodium channel]] \u03b1-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 encoding gene, ''[[Nav1.7|SCN9A]]''. This channel is expressed primarily in [[nociceptor]]s of the [[dorsal root ganglion]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study and they have all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As can be seen from table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the [[resting membrane potential]]. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in [[membrane potential]].\n\nSome of these mutant channels have been expressed in [[dorsal root ganglion]] (DRG) or [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[neuron]]s. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for [[action potential]] creation (93.1 \u00b1 12.0 [[ampere|pA]]) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 \u00b1 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials.<ref name=\"Dib-Hajj_2005\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dib-Hajj SD, Rush AM, Cummins TR, etal |title=Gain-of-function mutation in Nav1.7 in familial erythromelalgia induces bursting of sensory neurons |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1847\u201354 |year=2005 |pmid=15958509 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh514}}</ref> There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants.

While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation{{Clarify|date=March 2012|reason=typo for initiation, valid, what?}} is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.<ref name=\"Rush_2006\"/>\n\nAn effective, though not recommended, treatment for erythromelalgia symptoms is cooling of the affected area. Activation of wild-type channels is unaffected by cooling. L858F mutant channels, however, are activated at more depolarized potentials when cooled than at normal body temperature. At 16&nbsp;\u00b0C the activation V<sub>\u00bd</sub> of the mutant channel is only 4.6mV more hyperpolarized that wild-type versus 9.6mV more hyperpolarized at 35&nbsp;\u00b0C. Fast inactivation is affected in a similar manner in both wild-type and L858F mutant channel and is, thus, unlikely to contribute to symptom resolution due to cooling. While such cooling is unlikely to affect neuronal cell bodies, [[axon]]s and termini express Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and are present in the skin.<ref name=\"Han_2007\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Han C, Lampert A, Rush AM, etal |title=Temperature dependence of erythromelalgia mutation L858F in sodium channel Nav1.7 |journal=[[Molecular Pain]] |volume=3 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17239250 |doi=10.1186/1744-8069-3-3 |pmc=1781932 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Table 1.'''

[[Complex regional pain syndrome]] (CRPS), for instance, presents with severe burning pain and redness except these symptoms are often unilateral (versus symmetric) and may be proximal instead of purely or primarily distal. Furthermore, attacks triggered by heat and resolved by cooling are less common with CRPS.\n\nErythromelalgia is sometimes caused by other disorders. A partial list of diseases known to precipitate erythromelalgia is below.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n:*[[Myeloproliferative disease]]\n:*[[Hypercholesterolemia]]\n:*[[Autoimmune disorder]]\n:*[[Small fiber peripheral neuropathy]]\n:*[[Fabry's disease]]\n:*[[Mercury poisoning]]\n:*[[Mushroom poisoning]]\n:*[[Obstructive Sleep Apnea]]\n:*[[Sciatica]]\n:*Some medications, such as [[fluoroquinolones]], [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[verapamil]], and [[ticlopidine]]\n\n==Treatment/management==\nFor secondary erythromelalgia, treatment of the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although [[aspirin]] has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised ''not'' to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin.  A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food storage bag.  The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.\n\nPrimary erythromelalgia management is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods. This list is by no means comprehensive as there are many triggers to set off a 'flaring' episode that are inexplicable. Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use of cold water baths is strongly discouraged. In pursuit of added relief sufferers can inadvertently cause tissue damage or death, i.e. necrosis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} See comments at the end of the preceding paragraph regarding possible effectiveness of plastic food storage bags to avoid/reduce negative effects of submersion in cold water baths.\n\nOne clinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of [[intravenous therapy|IV]] [[lidocaine]] or oral [[mexilitine]], though differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied. Another trial has shown promise for [[misoprostol]], while other have shown that [[gabapentin]], [[venlafaxine]] and oral [[magnesium]] may also be effective,<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/> but no further testing was carried out as newer research superseded this combination.\n\nStrong anecdotal evidence from EM patients shows that a combination of drugs such as [[duloxetine]] and [[pregabalin]] is an effective way of reducing the stabbing pains and burning sensation symptoms of erythromelalgia in conjunction with the appropriate analgesia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In some cases, antihistamines may give some relief. Most people with erythromelalgia  never go into remission and the symptoms are ever present at some level, whilst others get worse, or the EM is eventually a symptom of another disease such as [[systemic scleroderma]].\n\nSome suffering with EM are prescribed [[ketamine]] topical creams as a way of managing pain on a long term basis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandroni P, Davis MD |title=Combination gel of 1% amitriptyline and 0.5% ketamine to treat refractory erythromelalgia pain: a new treatment option? |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=283\u20136 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16549702 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.3.283 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16549702 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070625063540/http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16549702 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-25 }}</ref> Feedback from some EM patients has led to reduction in usage as they believe it is only effective for short periods.\n\nLiving with erythromelalgia can result in a deterioration in quality of life resulting in the inability to function in a work place, lack of mobility, depression, and is socially alienating; much greater education of medical practitioners is needed. As with many rare diseases, many people with EM end up taking years to get a diagnosis and to receive appropriate treatment.\n\nResearch into the genetic mutations continues but there is a paucity of clinical studies focusing on living with erythromelalgia. There is much urgency within pharmaceutical companies to provide a solution to those who suffer with pain such as that with erythromelalgia.\n\n===Pain relief===\nPatients find relief by cooling the skin.

These symptoms are often symmetric and affect the lower extremities more frequently than the upper extremities. Symptoms may also affect the ears and face. For secondary erythromelalgia, attacks typically precede and are precipitated by the underlying primary condition. For primary erythromelalgia, attacks can last from an hour to months at a time and occur infrequently to frequently with multiple times daily. Attacks most frequently occur at night, thus having the potential to greatly interfere with sleep. Common triggers for daytime episodes are exertion, heating of the affected extremities, and alcohol or caffeine consumption, and any pressure applied to the limbs. In some patients sugar and even [[melon]] consumption have also been known to provoke attacks. Many of those with primary erythromelalgia avoid wearing shoes or socks as the heat this generates is known to produce erythromelalgia attacks.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/> The coexistence of erythromelalgia and [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is rare, but case studies of patients with both diagnoses have been reported in medical journals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Berlin AL, Pehr K |title=Coexistence of erythromelalgia and Raynaud's phenomenon |journal=J.

In other cases symptoms emerge full blown with onset.\n\n==Cause==\n[[File:Erythromelalgia-symptoms.jpg|thumb|Toes during an EM flareup]]\nIn general, erythromelalgia seems to consist of [[neuropathology|neuropathological]] and [[capillary|microvascular]] alterations. How this occurs in secondary erythromelalgia is poorly understood and may be specific to the underlying primary condition. Primary conditions that have been shown to elicit erythromelalgia are listed in [[erythromelalgia#Diagnosis|diagnosis]], below.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n\nPrimary erythromelalgia is a better understood [[autosomal dominant]] disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of [[group C nerve fiber|C-fibers]] in the [[dorsal root ganglion]]. Specifically, [[nociceptor]]s (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) appear to be the primarily affected neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The [[sympathetic nervous system]] controls [[cutaneous]] [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular]] [[muscle tone|tone]] and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the [[sodium channel]] [[Nav1.7|Na<sub>V</sub>1.7]]. These differences in excitability alterations between the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and [[nociceptor]]s is due to different expression of [[sodium channel]]s other than Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 in them.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n\nWhat causes epidemic erythromelalgia in southern China remains unknown although several erythromelalgia-associated poxviruses were isolated from throat swabs of several patients at different counties and two different seasons.<ref name=\"Zheng\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(88)90372-8 | last1 = Zheng | first1 = Z.

This section pertains solely to primary erythromelalgia as the secondary form is too poorly understood.''\n\nThere are 10 known mutations in the voltage-gated [[sodium channel]] \u03b1-subunit Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 encoding gene, ''[[Nav1.7|SCN9A]]''. This channel is expressed primarily in [[nociceptor]]s of the [[dorsal root ganglion]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study and they have all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As can be seen from table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the [[resting membrane potential]]. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in [[membrane potential]].\n\nSome of these mutant channels have been expressed in [[dorsal root ganglion]] (DRG) or [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] [[neuron]]s. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for [[action potential]] creation (93.1 \u00b1 12.0 [[ampere|pA]]) than those expressing wild-type channels (124.1 \u00b1 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing wild-type channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials.<ref name=\"Dib-Hajj_2005\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dib-Hajj SD, Rush AM, Cummins TR, etal |title=Gain-of-function mutation in Nav1.7 in familial erythromelalgia induces bursting of sensory neurons |journal=Brain |volume=128 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1847\u201354 |year=2005 |pmid=15958509 |doi=10.1093/brain/awh514}}</ref> There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants.

While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to wild-type expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation{{Clarify|date=March 2012|reason=typo for initiation, valid, what?}} is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing wild-type channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.<ref name=\"Rush_2006\"/>\n\nAn effective, though not recommended, treatment for erythromelalgia symptoms is cooling of the affected area. Activation of wild-type channels is unaffected by cooling. L858F mutant channels, however, are activated at more depolarized potentials when cooled than at normal body temperature. At 16&nbsp;\u00b0C the activation V<sub>\u00bd</sub> of the mutant channel is only 4.6mV more hyperpolarized that wild-type versus 9.6mV more hyperpolarized at 35&nbsp;\u00b0C. Fast inactivation is affected in a similar manner in both wild-type and L858F mutant channel and is, thus, unlikely to contribute to symptom resolution due to cooling. While such cooling is unlikely to affect neuronal cell bodies, [[axon]]s and termini express Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and are present in the skin.<ref name=\"Han_2007\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Han C, Lampert A, Rush AM, etal |title=Temperature dependence of erythromelalgia mutation L858F in sodium channel Nav1.7 |journal=[[Molecular Pain]] |volume=3 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17239250 |doi=10.1186/1744-8069-3-3 |pmc=1781932 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Table 1.'''

[[Complex regional pain syndrome]] (CRPS), for instance, presents with severe burning pain and redness except these symptoms are often unilateral (versus symmetric) and may be proximal instead of purely or primarily distal. Furthermore, attacks triggered by heat and resolved by cooling are less common with CRPS.\n\nErythromelalgia is sometimes caused by other disorders. A partial list of diseases known to precipitate erythromelalgia is below.<ref name=\"Novella_2007\"/>\n:*[[Myeloproliferative disease]]\n:*[[Hypercholesterolemia]]\n:*[[Autoimmune disorder]]\n:*[[Small fiber peripheral neuropathy]]\n:*[[Fabry's disease]]\n:*[[Mercury poisoning]]\n:*[[Mushroom poisoning]]\n:*[[Obstructive Sleep Apnea]]\n:*[[Sciatica]]\n:*Some medications, such as [[fluoroquinolones]], [[bromocriptine]], [[pergolide]], [[verapamil]], and [[ticlopidine]]\n\n==Treatment/management==\nFor secondary erythromelalgia, treatment of the underlying primary disorder is the most primary method of treatment. Although [[aspirin]] has been thought to reduce symptoms of erythromelalgia, it is rare to find evidence that this is effective. Mechanical cooling of the limbs by elevating them can help or managing the ambient environment frequently is often necessary constantly as flares occur due to sympathetic autonomic dysfunction of the capillaries. The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, phantom limb or thalamic pain syndrome). Patients are strongly advised ''not'' to place the affected limbs in cold water to relieve symptoms when flaring occurs. It may seem a good idea, but it precipitates problems further down the line causing damage to the skin and ulceration often intractable due to the damaged skin.  A possible reduction in skin damage may be accomplished by enclosing the flaring limb in a commonly available, thin, heat transparent, water impermeable, plastic food storage bag.  The advice of a physician is advised depending on specific circumstances.\n\nPrimary erythromelalgia management is symptomatic, i.e. treating painful symptoms only. Specific management tactics include avoidance of attack triggers such as: heat, change in temperature, exercise or over exertion, alcohol and spicy foods. This list is by no means comprehensive as there are many triggers to set off a 'flaring' episode that are inexplicable. Whilst a cool environment is helpful in keeping the symptoms in control, the use of cold water baths is strongly discouraged. In pursuit of added relief sufferers can inadvertently cause tissue damage or death, i.e. necrosis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} See comments at the end of the preceding paragraph regarding possible effectiveness of plastic food storage bags to avoid/reduce negative effects of submersion in cold water baths.\n\nOne clinical study has demonstrated the efficacy of [[intravenous therapy|IV]] [[lidocaine]] or oral [[mexilitine]], though differences between the primary and secondary forms were not studied.

Most people with erythromelalgia  never go into remission and the symptoms are ever present at some level, whilst others get worse, or the EM is eventually a symptom of another disease such as [[systemic scleroderma]].\n\nSome suffering with EM are prescribed [[ketamine]] topical creams as a way of managing pain on a long term basis.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandroni P, Davis MD |title=Combination gel of 1% amitriptyline and 0.5% ketamine to treat refractory erythromelalgia pain: a new treatment option? |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=283\u20136 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16549702 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.3.283 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16549702 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070625063540/http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16549702 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-25 }}</ref> Feedback from some EM patients has led to reduction in usage as they believe it is only effective for short periods.\n\nLiving with erythromelalgia can result in a deterioration in quality of life resulting in the inability to function in a work place, lack of mobility, depression, and is socially alienating; much greater education of medical practitioners is needed.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural [[protein|proteins]] (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60. For example, the T=3 ''[[Tomato bushy stunt virus]]'' has 60x3 protein subunits (180 copies of the same structural protein).<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Alan J Cann|title=Virus Structure|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2 |year=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url= | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism.

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] (sponges) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures.

Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role.

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans.

The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]].

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures.

Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role.

TSC was extracted from the images and compared to the Gleason score of imaged lesions. This work showed statistically significant increases in TSC as prostate cancer increased in aggression. This preliminary study suggests that sodium MRI can accurately characterize the stage of prostate cancer. This suggests the potential use of sodium-MRI to better management and stage patients with prostate cancer into treatment schemes.\n\n==Advantages==\n<sup>23</sup>Na MRI measures cellular [[metabolic rate]] as well as disease-related change in tissues and organs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Madelin|first=Guillaume|last2=Kline|first2=Richard|last3=Walvick|first3=Ronn|last4=Regatte|first4=Ravinder R.|date=2014-04-23|title=A method for estimating intracellular sodium concentration and extracellular volume fraction in brain in vivo using sodium magnetic resonance imaging|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=4|pages=4763|doi=10.1038/srep04763|pmc=4762219|pmid=24755879|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E4763M}}</ref> It had improved from 45min length to only 15 mins at 1.5T.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Unlike other MRI scanning, sodium MRI captures only sodium signals inside bodies.
