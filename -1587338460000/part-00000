The North Eastern Province was closed to general access (along with other parts of Kenya) as a \"scheduled\" area (ostensibly closed to all outsiders, including members of parliament, as a means of protecting the nomadic inhabitants), and news from it was very difficult to obtain. A number of reports, however, accused the Kenyans of mass slaughters of entire villages of Somali citizens and of setting up large \"protected villages\" \u2013 in effect [[concentration camp]]s. The government refused to acknowledge the ethnically based irredentist motives of the Somalis, making constant reference in official statements to the ''shifta'' (bandit) problem in the area.<ref name=\"Howard\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Conflict==\nThe province thus entered a period of running skirmishes between the [[Military of Kenya|Kenyan Army]] and Somali-backed [[Northern Frontier District Liberation Movement]] (NFDLM) insurgents. The first high-profile victims were two [[Borana Oromo people|Borana]] leaders, the first African [[Colonial Service|District Commissioner]] Dabaso Wabera and [[tribal chief]] Haji Galma Dido, who were assassinated while a route to [[Isiolo]] to urge locals not to back the [[Secession|secessionists]]<ref name=\":0\" />. The two assassins were Somali residents of Kenya who later escaped across the Somali border.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Somali Dispute|last=Drysdale|first=John|publisher=Pall Mall Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nOne immediate consequence of the Shifta insurgency was the signing in 1964 of a Mutual Defense Treaty between [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s administration and the government of Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]].<ref name=\"Wanambisi\" />\n\nAt the outset of the war, the government declared a State of Emergency. This consisted of allowing security forces to detain people up to 56 days without trial, confiscating the property of communities allegedly in retaliation for acts of violence, and restricting the right to assembly and movement. A 'prohibited zone' was created along the Somali border, and the death penalty was made mandatory for unauthorised possession of firearms. \"Special courts\" without guarantee of [[due process]] were also created. The northeast\u2014declared a \"special district\" \u2013 was subject to nearly unfettered government control, including the authority to detain, arrest or forcibly move individuals or groups, as well as confiscate possessions and land.<ref name=Waal40>de Waal 1997, p. 40</ref> However, as part of its effort to reassure the public, the [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation|Voice of Kenya]] was warned not to refer to the conflict as a \"border dispute\", while a special government committee decided to refer to the rebels as \"shiftas\" to minimise the political nature of the war.\n\nOver the course of the war, the new Kenyan government became increasingly concerned by the growing strength of the Somali military. At independence, Somalia had a weak army of 5,000 troops that was incapable of exerting itself beyond its borders. However, in 1963, the Somali government appealed for assistance from the [[Soviet Union]], which responded by lending it about $32 million. By 1969, 800 Somali officers had received Soviet training, while the army had expanded to over 23,000 well-equipped troops. The Kenyan fear that the insurgency might escalate into an all-out war with phalanxes of well-equipped Somali troops was coupled with a concern about the new insurgent tactic of planting [[land mine]]s.\n\nThe Kenyan government response may have been inspired by the counter-insurgency efforts taken by the British during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], which had been spearheaded by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], who now ironically dominated the [[Kenya African National Union]]-led government. In 1967, Kenyan fears reached a fever pitch, and a special government committee was created to prepare for a full-scale war with Somalia. The government also adopted a policy of compulsory [[villagization]] in the war-affected area. In 1967, the populace was moved into 14 ''Manyattas'', villages that were guarded by troops (some referred to them as concentration camps). East Africa scholar [[Alex de Waal]] described the result as \"a military assault upon the entire pastoral way of life,\" as enormous numbers of livestock were confiscated or killed, partly to deny their use by the guerrillas and partly to force the populace to abandon their flocks and move to a ''Manyatta''. Thus, made destitute, many nomads became an urban underclass, while educated Somalis in Kenya fled the country.<ref name=Waal40/> The government also replaced the dynastic Sultans, who were the traditional leaders, with low-ranking government-appointed chiefs.<ref name=Mburu100>Mburu 1999, p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1967, [[Zambia]]n President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] mediated peace talks between Somali Prime Minister [[Mohamed Egal]] and Kenyatta. These bore fruit in October 1967, when the governments of Kenya and Somalia signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (the Arusha Memorandum) that resulted in an official ceasefire, though regional security did not prevail until 1969.<ref name=\"Hogg1986\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = Richard | year = 1986 | title = The New Pastoralism: Poverty and Dependency in Northern Kenya | jstor =  1160687 | journal = Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 319\u2013333 }}</ref><ref name=\"Howell1968\">{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = John |date=May 1968 | title = An Analysis of Kenyan Foreign Policy | jstor =  158675 | journal = The Journal of Modern African Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 1  | pages = 29\u201348 | doi=10.1017/S0022278X00016657}}</ref> After a 1969 coup in Somalia, the new military leader [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], abolished this MoU as he claimed it was corrupt and unsatisfactory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The ''Manyatta'' strategy is seen as playing a key role in ending the insurgency, though the Somali government may have also decided that the potential benefits of a war simply was not worth the cost and risk. However, Somalia did not renounce its claim to [[Greater Somalia]].<ref name=Wanambisi/>\n\n==Effects==\nWith Somali support for their movement for self-determination temporarily halted, many former rebels returned to the traditional activity of pastoralism.\n\nThe forced internment of the Northern Frontier District's inhabitants also resulted in an economic bifurcation of its other minority residents. Those with means diversified into trade and sedentary farming. Those without became wage labourers, while the poorest were reduced to dependence on outside relief aid. Anthropologist John Baxter returned to the village in [[Isiolo District]] that he had researched in 1953, and had this to say about the few non-Somali minority tribes that lived at the time alongside the Somali majority:\n\n<blockquote>In 1982, only a few fortunate ones still maintained themselves through stock pastoralism.  Some 40 percent of the Boran and Sakuye of the District had been driven to peri-urban shanty villages in the new administrative townships.  There, they eked out a bare subsistence, hanging around the petrol stations for odd jobs, hawking for [[khat|''miraa'']], making illicit alcohol, engaging in prostitution and the like.<ref>Baxter 1993, p. 143, quoted in de Waal, p. 39</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe war thus marked the beginning of decades of violent crackdowns and repressive measures by the police in the NFD coupled with trumped-up allegations and unsubtle innuendo on the part of the Kenyan media charging the region's almost exclusively Somali inhabitants with \"banditry\" and other vice.<ref>Vigdis Broch-Due, ''Violence and Belonging: The Quest for Identity in Post-colonial Africa'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2005), p.174-175</ref>\n\nA particularly violent incident referred to as the [[Wagalla massacre|Wagalla Massacre]] took place in 1984, when the Kenyan provincial commissioner ordered security forces to gather 5,000 men of the Somali [[Degodia]] clan onto the airstrip at [[Wagalla]], [[Wajir]], open fire on them, and then attempt to hide their bodies. In the year 2000, the government admitted to having killed 380 people, though independent estimates put the toll at over 2,000.<ref>de Waal 1997, p. 41; {{cite web |url= http://www.benadir-watch.com/2005%20News/0226_NFD_Wagalla_Massacre.pdf |title= \"Wagalla Massacre: Families Demand Payment\" |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228121259/http://www.benadir-watch.com/2005%20News/0226_NFD_Wagalla_Massacre.pdf |archivedate= 28 February 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(13.4&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, ''The East African Standard'', 26 February 2005 (hosted by benadir-watch.com); and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/978922.stm \"Kenya admits mistakes over 'massacre'\"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 18 October 2000</ref>\n\nNot until late 2000 and the administration of Provincial Commissioner [[Mohammoud Saleh]] \u2013 a Somali\u2014was there a serious drop in violent activities, partially attributable to Saleh's zero tolerance policy towards abuse by security forces.

At independence, Somalia had a weak army of 5,000 troops that was incapable of exerting itself beyond its borders. However, in 1963, the Somali government appealed for assistance from the [[Soviet Union]], which responded by lending it about $32 million. By 1969, 800 Somali officers had received Soviet training, while the army had expanded to over 23,000 well-equipped troops. The Kenyan fear that the insurgency might escalate into an all-out war with phalanxes of well-equipped Somali troops was coupled with a concern about the new insurgent tactic of planting [[land mine]]s.\n\nThe Kenyan government response may have been inspired by the counter-insurgency efforts taken by the British during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], which had been spearheaded by the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], who now ironically dominated the [[Kenya African National Union]]-led government. In 1967, Kenyan fears reached a fever pitch, and a special government committee was created to prepare for a full-scale war with Somalia. The government also adopted a policy of compulsory [[villagization]] in the war-affected area. In 1967, the populace was moved into 14 ''Manyattas'', villages that were guarded by troops (some referred to them as concentration camps). East Africa scholar [[Alex de Waal]] described the result as \"a military assault upon the entire pastoral way of life,\" as enormous numbers of livestock were confiscated or killed, partly to deny their use by the guerrillas and partly to force the populace to abandon their flocks and move to a ''Manyatta''. Thus, made destitute, many nomads became an urban underclass, while educated Somalis in Kenya fled the country.<ref name=Waal40/> The government also replaced the dynastic Sultans, who were the traditional leaders, with low-ranking government-appointed chiefs.<ref name=Mburu100>Mburu 1999, p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1967, [[Zambia]]n President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] mediated peace talks between Somali Prime Minister [[Mohamed Egal]] and Kenyatta. These bore fruit in October 1967, when the governments of Kenya and Somalia signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (the Arusha Memorandum) that resulted in an official ceasefire, though regional security did not prevail until 1969.<ref name=\"Hogg1986\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = Richard | year = 1986 | title = The New Pastoralism: Poverty and Dependency in Northern Kenya | jstor =  1160687 | journal = Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 319\u2013333 }}</ref><ref name=\"Howell1968\">{{cite journal | last1 = Howell | first1 = John |date=May 1968 | title = An Analysis of Kenyan Foreign Policy | jstor =  158675 | journal = The Journal of Modern African Studies | volume = 6 | issue = 1  | pages = 29\u201348 | doi=10.1017/S0022278X00016657}}</ref> After a 1969 coup in Somalia, the new military leader [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], abolished this MoU as he claimed it was corrupt and unsatisfactory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The ''Manyatta'' strategy is seen as playing a key role in ending the insurgency, though the Somali government may have also decided that the potential benefits of a war simply was not worth the cost and risk. However, Somalia did not renounce its claim to [[Greater Somalia]].<ref name=Wanambisi/>\n\n==Effects==\nWith Somali support for their movement for self-determination temporarily halted, many former rebels returned to the traditional activity of pastoralism.\n\nThe forced internment of the Northern Frontier District's inhabitants also resulted in an economic bifurcation of its other minority residents. Those with means diversified into trade and sedentary farming. Those without became wage labourers, while the poorest were reduced to dependence on outside relief aid. Anthropologist John Baxter returned to the village in [[Isiolo District]] that he had researched in 1953, and had this to say about the few non-Somali minority tribes that lived at the time alongside the Somali majority:\n\n<blockquote>In 1982, only a few fortunate ones still maintained themselves through stock pastoralism.  Some 40 percent of the Boran and Sakuye of the District had been driven to peri-urban shanty villages in the new administrative townships.  There, they eked out a bare subsistence, hanging around the petrol stations for odd jobs, hawking for [[khat|''miraa'']], making illicit alcohol, engaging in prostitution and the like.<ref>Baxter 1993, p. 143, quoted in de Waal, p. 39</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe war thus marked the beginning of decades of violent crackdowns and repressive measures by the police in the NFD coupled with trumped-up allegations and unsubtle innuendo on the part of the Kenyan media charging the region's almost exclusively Somali inhabitants with \"banditry\" and other vice.<ref>Vigdis Broch-Due, ''Violence and Belonging: The Quest for Identity in Post-colonial Africa'', 1 edition, (Routledge: 2005), p.174-175</ref>\n\nA particularly violent incident referred to as the [[Wagalla massacre|Wagalla Massacre]] took place in 1984, when the Kenyan provincial commissioner ordered security forces to gather 5,000 men of the Somali [[Degodia]] clan onto the airstrip at [[Wagalla]], [[Wajir]], open fire on them, and then attempt to hide their bodies. In the year 2000, the government admitted to having killed 380 people, though independent estimates put the toll at over 2,000.<ref>de Waal 1997, p. 41; {{cite web |url= http://www.benadir-watch.com/2005%20News/0226_NFD_Wagalla_Massacre.pdf |title= \"Wagalla Massacre: Families Demand Payment\" |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080228121259/http://www.benadir-watch.com/2005%20News/0226_NFD_Wagalla_Massacre.pdf |archivedate= 28 February 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(13.4&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, ''The East African Standard'', 26 February 2005 (hosted by benadir-watch.com); and [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/978922.stm \"Kenya admits mistakes over 'massacre'\"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 18 October 2000</ref>\n\nNot until late 2000 and the administration of Provincial Commissioner [[Mohammoud Saleh]] \u2013 a Somali\u2014was there a serious drop in violent activities, partially attributable to Saleh's zero tolerance policy towards abuse by security forces. Ironically, Saleh himself was the target of the local police, having been arrested and booked several times.

Some Muslims opposed aspects of Sunni orthodoxy, and rites having a non-Islamic origin were widespread, being accepted as if they were integral to Islam, or sometimes being recognized as separate. Moreover, Sunni Islam in Sudan (as in much of Africa) has been characterized by the formation of religious orders or brotherhoods, each of which made special demands on its adherents.\n\n====Five pillars====\n[[File:Sudan Omdurman Main Mosque Main Entrance 1936.jpg|thumb|right|[[Omdurman]] Main Mosque in 1936.]]\nSunni Islam requires its adherents to follow the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar, the [[shahadah]] or profession of faith is the affirmation \"There is no god but God (Allah) and [[Muhammad]] is his prophet.\" It is the first step in becoming a Muslim and a significant part of prayer. The second obligation is [[salat|prayer at five specified times of the day]]. The third enjoins [[Zakat|almsgiving]]. The fourth requires [[Sawm|fasting during daylight hours]] in the month of [[Ramadan]]. The fifth requires a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] for those able to perform it, to participate in the special rites that occur during the twelfth month of the [[lunar calendar]].\nMost Sudanese Muslims are born to the faith and meet the first requirement. Conformity to the second requirement is more variable. Many males in the [[List of cities in Sudan|cities]] and larger towns manage to pray five times a day: at dawn, noon, midafternoon, sundown, and evening. The well-to-do perform little work during Ramadan, and many businesses close or operate on reduced schedules. In the early 1990s, its observance appeared to be widespread, especially in urban areas and among sedentary Sudanese Muslims.\n\n[[File:Minaret S.jpg|thumb|left|A [[minaret]] in [[Port Sudan]].]]\n\nThe [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca is less costly and arduous for the Sudanese than it is for many Muslims. Nevertheless, it takes time (or money if travel is by air), and the ordinary Sudanese Muslim has generally found it difficult to accomplish, rarely undertaking it before middle age. Some have joined pilgrimage societies into which members pay a small amount monthly and choose one of their number when sufficient funds have accumulated to send someone on the pilgrimage. A returned pilgrim is entitled to use the honorific title hajj or hajjih for a woman.\n\nAnother ceremony commonly observed is the great feast [[Eid ul-Adha|Id al Adha]] (also known as Id al Kabir), representing the sacrifice made during the last days of the pilgrimage. The centerpiece of the day is the slaughter of a sheep, which is distributed to the poor, kin, neighbors, and friends, as well as the immediate family.\n\nIslam imposes a standard of conduct encouraging generosity, fairness, and honesty towards other Muslims. Sudanese Arabs, especially those who are wealthy, are expected by their coreligionists to be generous.\n\n====Islam in Sudanese law====\nIn accordance with Islamic law most Sudanese Muslims do not eat [[Islamic dietary laws|pork]]. Conformity to the prohibitions on gambling and alcohol is less widespread. . [[Usury]] is also forbidden by Islamic law, but [[Islamic Banking|Islamic banks]] have developed other ways of making money available to the public. Some Sudanese are skeptical of Islamic Banking\u2014seeing it as an attempt by the religious elite to mask exploitative capitalist banking practices under a guise of religious sanctity\n\nIn Sudan (until 1983) modern criminal and civil, including commercial, law generally prevailed. In the north, however, the sharia, was expected to govern what is usually called family and personal law, i.e., matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In the towns and in some sedentary communities sharia was accepted, but in other sedentary communities and among [[nomads]] local custom was likely to prevail{{spaced ndash}}particularly with respect to inheritance.\n\nIn September 1983, [[Gaafar Nimeiry|Nimeiri]] imposed the sharia throughout the land, eliminating the civil and penal codes by which the country had been governed in the twentieth century. Traditional Islamic punishments were imposed for [[Hudud|theft, adultery, homicide]], and other crimes. The zealousness with which these punishments were carried out contributed to the fall of Nimeiri. Nevertheless, no successor government has shown inclination to abandon the sharia.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nimeiri and Sharia imposing |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=624\u2013637 |jstor=4328194 |last1=Warburg |first1=Gabriel R. |year=1990 }}</ref>\n\n====Other influences====\nIslam is [[monotheistic]] and insists that there can be no intercessors between an individual and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in [[spirit]]s as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical ways of dealing with them. The [[imam]] of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a [[faqih]] (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as [[amulets]] and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with [[occult]] threats to health and well- being. The notion that the words of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of [[Demon|evil spirits]] or the [[evil eye]] is deeply embedded in popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.\n\nIn Sudan as in much of African Islam, the cult of the [[saint]] is of considerable importance, although some Muslims would reject it. The development of the cult is closely related to the presence of the religious orders; many who came to be considered saints on their deaths were founders or leaders of religious orders who in their lifetimes were thought to have [[barakah]], a state of blessedness implying an indwelling spiritual power inherent in the religious office. Baraka intensifies after death as the deceased becomes a [[wali]] (literally friend of God, but in this context translated as saint). The tomb and other places associated with the saintly being become the loci of the person's baraka, and in some views he or she becomes the guardian spirit of the locality. The intercession of the wali is sought on a variety of occasions, particularly by those seeking cures or by barren women desiring children. A saint's annual holy day is the occasion of a local festival that may attract a large gathering.\n\nBetter-educated Muslims in Sudan may participate in prayer at a saint's tomb but argue that prayer is directed only to God. Many others, however, see the saint not merely as an intercessor with and an agent of God, but also as a nearly autonomous source of blessing and power, thereby approaching \"popular\" as opposed to orthodox Islam.\n\n====Movements and religious orders====\nIslam made its deepest and longest lasting impact in Sudan through the activity of the Islamic religious brotherhoods or orders. These orders emerged in the Middle East in the twelfth century in connection with the development of [[Sufism]], a reaction based in [[mysticism]] to the strongly legalistic orientation of mainstream Islam. These orders first came to Sudan in the sixteenth century and became significant in the eighteenth. Sufism seeks for its adherents a closer personal relationship with God through special spiritual disciplines. The exercises (or ''[[dhikr]]'') include reciting prayers and passages of the Qur'an and repeating the names, or attributes, of God while performing physical movements according to the formula established by the founder of the particular order. Singing and dancing may be introduced. The outcome of an exercise, which lasts much longer than the usual daily prayer, is often a state of ecstatic abandon.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Sudan dancing dervish 7feb2005.jpg|A Dancing dervish\nImage:Sudan Dervish 1920s.jpg|A dervish from the 1920s\n</gallery>\n\nA mystical or devotional way (sing. ''[[tariqa]]''; pl. ''turuq'') is the basis for the formation of particular orders, each of which is also called a tariqa. The specialists in [[religious law]] and learning initially looked askance at Sufism and the Sufi orders, but the leaders of Sufi orders in Sudan have won acceptance by acknowledging the significance of the sharia and not claiming that Sufism replaces it.\n\nThe principal turuq vary considerably in their practice and internal organization. Some orders are tightly organized in hierarchical fashion; others have allowed their local branches considerable autonomy. There may be as many as a dozen turuq in Sudan. Some are restricted to that country; others are widespread in Africa or the Middle East. Several turuq, for all practical purposes independent, are offshoots of older orders and were established by men who altered in major or minor ways the tariqa of the orders to which they had formerly been attached.\n\nThe oldest and most widespread of the turuq is the [[Qadiriyah]] founded by [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]] in [[Baghdad]] in the twelfth century and introduced into Sudan in the sixteenth. The Qadiriyah's principal rival and the largest tariqa in the western part of the country was the [[Tijaniyah]], a sect begun by [[Sidi Ahmed al-Tidjani]] at [[Tijani]] in Morocco, which eventually penetrated Sudan in about 1810 via the western [[Sahel]] (a narrow band of savanna bordering the southern Sahara, stretching across Africa). Many Tijani became influential in [[Darfur]], and other adherents settled in northern [[Kurdufan]]. Later on, a class of Tijani merchants arose as markets grew in towns and trade expanded, making them less concerned with providing religious leadership. Of greater importance to Sudan was the tariqa established by the followers of [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris]], known as [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Al Fasi]], who died in 1837. Although he lived in Arabia and never visited Sudan, his students spread into the Nile Valley establishing indigenous Sudanese orders which include the Majdhubiyah, the Idrisiyah, the Ismailiyah, and the Khatmiyyah.\n\nMuch different in organization from the other brotherhoods is the [[Khatmiyyah]] (or Mirghaniyah after the name of the order's founder). Established in the early nineteenth century by [[Muhammad Uthman al Mirghani]], it became the best organized and most politically oriented and powerful of the turuq in eastern Sudan (see [[Turkiyah]]). Mirghani had been a student of Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris and had joined several important orders, calling his own order the seal of the paths (Khatim at Turuq\u2014hence Khatmiyyah). The salient features of the Khatmiyyah are the extraordinary status of the Mirghani family, whose members alone may head the order; loyalty to the order, which guarantees paradise; and the centralized control of the order's branches.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ahmad]]\nThe Khatmiyyah had its center in the southern section of [[Ash Sharqi]] State and its greatest following in eastern Sudan and in portions of the riverine area. The Mirghani family were able to turn the Khatmiyyah into a political power base, despite its broad geographical distribution, because of the tight control they exercised over their followers. Moreover, gifts from followers over the years have given the family and the order the wealth to organize politically. This power did not equal, however, that of the Mirghanis' principal rival, the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]], or followers of the Mahdi, whose present-day leader was [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], the great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who drove the Egyptian administration from Sudan in 1885.\n\nMost other orders were either smaller or less well organized than the Khatmiyyah. Moreover, unlike many other African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not all seem to feel the need to identify with one or another tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of the true nature of Islam.\n\nOne of these movements, [[Islamic messianism|Mahdism]], was founded in the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a religious order, but it is not a tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be [[Mahdi|al-Mahdi al-Muntazar]] (\"the awaited guide in the right path\"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for [[Second Coming|the second coming]] of the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was essential that the people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see [[Mahdist Sudan#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]]). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was in fact the Mahdi.\n\nIn the century since the Mahdist uprising, the neo-Mahdist movement and the Ansar, supporters of Mahdism from the west, have persisted as a political force in Sudan. Many groups, from the [[Baggara|Baqqara]] cattle nomads to the largely sedentary tribes on the [[White Nile]], supported this movement. The Ansar were hierarchically organized under the control of Muhammad Ahmad's successors, who have all been members of the Mahdi family (known as the [[ashraf]]). The ambitions and varying political perspectives of different members of the family have led to internal conflicts, and it appeared that Sadiq al-Mahdi, putative leader of the Ansar since the early 1970s, did not enjoy the unanimous support of all Mahdists. Mahdist family political goals and ambitions seemed to have taken precedence over the movement's original religious mission. The modern-day Ansar were thus loyal more to the political descendants of the Mahdi than to the religious message of Mahdism.\n\nA movement that spread widely in Sudan in the 1960s, responding to the efforts to secularize Islamic society, was the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimin). Originally the Muslim Brotherhood, often known simply as the Brotherhood, was conceived as a religious revivalist movement that sought to return to the fundamentals of Islam in a way that would be compatible with the technological innovations introduced from the West. Disciplined, highly motivated, and well financed the Brotherhood became a powerful political force during the 1970s and 1980s, although it represented only a small minority of Sudanese. In the government that was formed in June 1989, following a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat, the Brotherhood exerted influence through its political wing, the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) party, which included several cabinet members among its adherents.\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:Sudan Farras fresco of cathedral 22dez2005.jpg|thumb|right|A fresco showing the birth of Jesus, in [[Faras]] cathedral.]]\nChristianity reached what is now northern [[Sudan]], then called [[Nubia]], by about the end of the first century after Christ.\n\nIt greatly developed under the influence of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://www.nubianet.org/about/about_history10.html Christianity in Nubia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303051552/http://www.nubianet.org/about/about_history10.html |date=3 March 2012 }}. nubianet.org</ref> Indeed, Byzantine architecture influenced most of the Christian churches in lower Nubia<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey S.

The remainder mainly belong to the [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] clade, which is borne by 18% of Gaalien, 17% of Arakien, and 14% of Meseria. Both paternal lineages are also common among local Nubians and Afroasiatic-speaking populations. The next most frequently observed haplogroups among Sudanese Arabs are the European-associated [[Haplogroup R1|R1]] clade (25% Meseria, 16% Gaalien, 8% Arakien), followed by the Eurasian lineage [[Haplogroup F (Y-DNA)|F]] (11% Meseria, 10% Gaalien, 8% Arakien), the Europe-associated [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] clade (7% Meseria, 4% Gaalien), and the African [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A3b2]] haplogroup (6% Gaalien).<ref name=\"Hassan2008\">{{cite journal|author=Hassan, Hisham Y. |display-authors=etal |title=Y\u2010chromosome variation among Sudanese: Restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=2008|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316\u2013323|url=http://docdro.id/e90MDsD|accessdate=13 November 2017|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876|pmid=18618658}}</ref>\n\nMaternally, Hassan (2009) observed that over 90% of the Sudanese Arabs samples carried various subclades of the Africa-centered [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|macrohaplogroup L]].

Beginning with the imposition of strict ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid 1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time, however, the European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s, were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]].\n\n==Clothing==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sudan - smiling lady.jpg\nImage:Piramidoj en Meroe (Sudano) 006.jpg\nImage:Deserto_Sudan_1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nGiven the cultural and religious differences within the country, Sudanese clothing varies among the different parts and peoples of Sudan. However, most individual Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn in Sudan is the [[jalabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. The jalabiya is accompanied by a large scarf worn by men, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences. Another traditional piece of clothing is the [[toub]] (pronounced to\u028ab). This is a large piece of fabric that measures around (4.5mx120m)or (4.5x110)depending on the way that its going to be worn is it the traditional way or the modern way ,basically you just wrapped around the body in a particular way. Something is usually worn under it to prevent exposure of private areas. This garment is worn by women.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://archive.org/details/ahistoryarabsin00macmgoog A History of the Arabs in the Sudan and Some Account of the People who ...

Some Muslims opposed aspects of Sunni orthodoxy, and rites having a non-Islamic origin were widespread, being accepted as if they were integral to Islam, or sometimes being recognized as separate. Moreover, Sunni Islam in Sudan (as in much of Africa) has been characterized by the formation of religious orders or brotherhoods, each of which made special demands on its adherents.\n\n====Five pillars====\n[[File:Sudan Omdurman Main Mosque Main Entrance 1936.jpg|thumb|right|[[Omdurman]] Main Mosque in 1936.]]\nSunni Islam requires its adherents to follow the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar, the [[shahadah]] or profession of faith is the affirmation \"There is no god but God (Allah) and [[Muhammad]] is his prophet.\" It is the first step in becoming a Muslim and a significant part of prayer. The second obligation is [[salat|prayer at five specified times of the day]]. The third enjoins [[Zakat|almsgiving]]. The fourth requires [[Sawm|fasting during daylight hours]] in the month of [[Ramadan]]. The fifth requires a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] for those able to perform it, to participate in the special rites that occur during the twelfth month of the [[lunar calendar]].\nMost Sudanese Muslims are born to the faith and meet the first requirement. Conformity to the second requirement is more variable. Many males in the [[List of cities in Sudan|cities]] and larger towns manage to pray five times a day: at dawn, noon, midafternoon, sundown, and evening. The well-to-do perform little work during Ramadan, and many businesses close or operate on reduced schedules. In the early 1990s, its observance appeared to be widespread, especially in urban areas and among sedentary Sudanese Muslims.\n\n[[File:Minaret S.jpg|thumb|left|A [[minaret]] in [[Port Sudan]].]]\n\nThe [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca is less costly and arduous for the Sudanese than it is for many Muslims. Nevertheless, it takes time (or money if travel is by air), and the ordinary Sudanese Muslim has generally found it difficult to accomplish, rarely undertaking it before middle age. Some have joined pilgrimage societies into which members pay a small amount monthly and choose one of their number when sufficient funds have accumulated to send someone on the pilgrimage. A returned pilgrim is entitled to use the honorific title hajj or hajjih for a woman.\n\nAnother ceremony commonly observed is the great feast [[Eid ul-Adha|Id al Adha]] (also known as Id al Kabir), representing the sacrifice made during the last days of the pilgrimage. The centerpiece of the day is the slaughter of a sheep, which is distributed to the poor, kin, neighbors, and friends, as well as the immediate family.\n\nIslam imposes a standard of conduct encouraging generosity, fairness, and honesty towards other Muslims. Sudanese Arabs, especially those who are wealthy, are expected by their coreligionists to be generous.\n\n====Islam in Sudanese law====\nIn accordance with Islamic law most Sudanese Muslims do not eat [[Islamic dietary laws|pork]]. Conformity to the prohibitions on gambling and alcohol is less widespread. . [[Usury]] is also forbidden by Islamic law, but [[Islamic Banking|Islamic banks]] have developed other ways of making money available to the public. Some Sudanese are skeptical of Islamic Banking\u2014seeing it as an attempt by the religious elite to mask exploitative capitalist banking practices under a guise of religious sanctity\n\nIn Sudan (until 1983) modern criminal and civil, including commercial, law generally prevailed. In the north, however, the sharia, was expected to govern what is usually called family and personal law, i.e., matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In the towns and in some sedentary communities sharia was accepted, but in other sedentary communities and among [[nomads]] local custom was likely to prevail{{spaced ndash}}particularly with respect to inheritance.\n\nIn September 1983, [[Gaafar Nimeiry|Nimeiri]] imposed the sharia throughout the land, eliminating the civil and penal codes by which the country had been governed in the twentieth century. Traditional Islamic punishments were imposed for [[Hudud|theft, adultery, homicide]], and other crimes. The zealousness with which these punishments were carried out contributed to the fall of Nimeiri. Nevertheless, no successor government has shown inclination to abandon the sharia.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nimeiri and Sharia imposing |journal=Middle East Journal |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=624\u2013637 |jstor=4328194 |last1=Warburg |first1=Gabriel R. |year=1990 }}</ref>\n\n====Other influences====\nIslam is [[monotheistic]] and insists that there can be no intercessors between an individual and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in [[spirit]]s as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical ways of dealing with them. The [[imam]] of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a [[faqih]] (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as [[amulets]] and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with [[occult]] threats to health and well- being. The notion that the words of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of [[Demon|evil spirits]] or the [[evil eye]] is deeply embedded in popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.\n\nIn Sudan as in much of African Islam, the cult of the [[saint]] is of considerable importance, although some Muslims would reject it. The development of the cult is closely related to the presence of the religious orders; many who came to be considered saints on their deaths were founders or leaders of religious orders who in their lifetimes were thought to have [[barakah]], a state of blessedness implying an indwelling spiritual power inherent in the religious office. Baraka intensifies after death as the deceased becomes a [[wali]] (literally friend of God, but in this context translated as saint). The tomb and other places associated with the saintly being become the loci of the person's baraka, and in some views he or she becomes the guardian spirit of the locality. The intercession of the wali is sought on a variety of occasions, particularly by those seeking cures or by barren women desiring children. A saint's annual holy day is the occasion of a local festival that may attract a large gathering.\n\nBetter-educated Muslims in Sudan may participate in prayer at a saint's tomb but argue that prayer is directed only to God. Many others, however, see the saint not merely as an intercessor with and an agent of God, but also as a nearly autonomous source of blessing and power, thereby approaching \"popular\" as opposed to orthodox Islam.\n\n====Movements and religious orders====\nIslam made its deepest and longest lasting impact in Sudan through the activity of the Islamic religious brotherhoods or orders. These orders emerged in the Middle East in the twelfth century in connection with the development of [[Sufism]], a reaction based in [[mysticism]] to the strongly legalistic orientation of mainstream Islam. These orders first came to Sudan in the sixteenth century and became significant in the eighteenth. Sufism seeks for its adherents a closer personal relationship with God through special spiritual disciplines. The exercises (or ''[[dhikr]]'') include reciting prayers and passages of the Qur'an and repeating the names, or attributes, of God while performing physical movements according to the formula established by the founder of the particular order. Singing and dancing may be introduced. The outcome of an exercise, which lasts much longer than the usual daily prayer, is often a state of ecstatic abandon.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Sudan dancing dervish 7feb2005.jpg|A Dancing dervish\nImage:Sudan Dervish 1920s.jpg|A dervish from the 1920s\n</gallery>\n\nA mystical or devotional way (sing. ''[[tariqa]]''; pl. ''turuq'') is the basis for the formation of particular orders, each of which is also called a tariqa. The specialists in [[religious law]] and learning initially looked askance at Sufism and the Sufi orders, but the leaders of Sufi orders in Sudan have won acceptance by acknowledging the significance of the sharia and not claiming that Sufism replaces it.\n\nThe principal turuq vary considerably in their practice and internal organization. Some orders are tightly organized in hierarchical fashion; others have allowed their local branches considerable autonomy. There may be as many as a dozen turuq in Sudan. Some are restricted to that country; others are widespread in Africa or the Middle East. Several turuq, for all practical purposes independent, are offshoots of older orders and were established by men who altered in major or minor ways the tariqa of the orders to which they had formerly been attached.\n\nThe oldest and most widespread of the turuq is the [[Qadiriyah]] founded by [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]] in [[Baghdad]] in the twelfth century and introduced into Sudan in the sixteenth. The Qadiriyah's principal rival and the largest tariqa in the western part of the country was the [[Tijaniyah]], a sect begun by [[Sidi Ahmed al-Tidjani]] at [[Tijani]] in Morocco, which eventually penetrated Sudan in about 1810 via the western [[Sahel]] (a narrow band of savanna bordering the southern Sahara, stretching across Africa). Many Tijani became influential in [[Darfur]], and other adherents settled in northern [[Kurdufan]]. Later on, a class of Tijani merchants arose as markets grew in towns and trade expanded, making them less concerned with providing religious leadership. Of greater importance to Sudan was the tariqa established by the followers of [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris]], known as [[Ahmad Ibn Idris Al-Fasi|Al Fasi]], who died in 1837. Although he lived in Arabia and never visited Sudan, his students spread into the Nile Valley establishing indigenous Sudanese orders which include the Majdhubiyah, the Idrisiyah, the Ismailiyah, and the Khatmiyyah.\n\nMuch different in organization from the other brotherhoods is the [[Khatmiyyah]] (or Mirghaniyah after the name of the order's founder). Established in the early nineteenth century by [[Muhammad Uthman al Mirghani]], it became the best organized and most politically oriented and powerful of the turuq in eastern Sudan (see [[Turkiyah]]). Mirghani had been a student of Sayyid Ahmad ibn Idris and had joined several important orders, calling his own order the seal of the paths (Khatim at Turuq\u2014hence Khatmiyyah). The salient features of the Khatmiyyah are the extraordinary status of the Mirghani family, whose members alone may head the order; loyalty to the order, which guarantees paradise; and the centralized control of the order's branches.\n\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ahmad]]\nThe Khatmiyyah had its center in the southern section of [[Ash Sharqi]] State and its greatest following in eastern Sudan and in portions of the riverine area. The Mirghani family were able to turn the Khatmiyyah into a political power base, despite its broad geographical distribution, because of the tight control they exercised over their followers. Moreover, gifts from followers over the years have given the family and the order the wealth to organize politically. This power did not equal, however, that of the Mirghanis' principal rival, the [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]], or followers of the Mahdi, whose present-day leader was [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], the great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who drove the Egyptian administration from Sudan in 1885.\n\nMost other orders were either smaller or less well organized than the Khatmiyyah. Moreover, unlike many other African Muslims, Sudanese Muslims did not all seem to feel the need to identify with one or another tariqa, even if the affiliation were nominal. Many Sudanese Muslims preferred more political movements that sought to change Islamic society and governance to conform to their own visions of the true nature of Islam.\n\nOne of these movements, [[Islamic messianism|Mahdism]], was founded in the late nineteenth century. It has been likened to a religious order, but it is not a tariqa in the traditional sense. Mahdism and its adherents, the Ansar, sought the regeneration of Islam, and in general were critical of the turuq. Muhammad Ahmad ibn as Sayyid Abd Allah, a faqih, proclaimed himself to be [[Mahdi|al-Mahdi al-Muntazar]] (\"the awaited guide in the right path\"), the messenger of God and representative of the Prophet Muhammad, an assertion that became an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] among the Ansar. He was sent, he said, to prepare the way for [[Second Coming|the second coming]] of the Prophet [[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]] (Jesus) and the impending end of the world. In anticipation of Judgment Day, it was essential that the people return to a simple and rigorous, even puritanical Islam (see [[Mahdist Sudan#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]]). The idea of the coming of a Mahdi has roots in Sunni Islamic traditions. The issue for Sudanese and other Muslims was whether Muhammad Ahmad was in fact the Mahdi.\n\nIn the century since the Mahdist uprising, the neo-Mahdist movement and the Ansar, supporters of Mahdism from the west, have persisted as a political force in Sudan. Many groups, from the [[Baggara|Baqqara]] cattle nomads to the largely sedentary tribes on the [[White Nile]], supported this movement. The Ansar were hierarchically organized under the control of Muhammad Ahmad's successors, who have all been members of the Mahdi family (known as the [[ashraf]]). The ambitions and varying political perspectives of different members of the family have led to internal conflicts, and it appeared that Sadiq al-Mahdi, putative leader of the Ansar since the early 1970s, did not enjoy the unanimous support of all Mahdists. Mahdist family political goals and ambitions seemed to have taken precedence over the movement's original religious mission. The modern-day Ansar were thus loyal more to the political descendants of the Mahdi than to the religious message of Mahdism.\n\nA movement that spread widely in Sudan in the 1960s, responding to the efforts to secularize Islamic society, was the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Al Ikhwan al Muslimin). Originally the Muslim Brotherhood, often known simply as the Brotherhood, was conceived as a religious revivalist movement that sought to return to the fundamentals of Islam in a way that would be compatible with the technological innovations introduced from the West. Disciplined, highly motivated, and well financed the Brotherhood became a powerful political force during the 1970s and 1980s, although it represented only a small minority of Sudanese. In the government that was formed in June 1989, following a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat, the Brotherhood exerted influence through its political wing, the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF) party, which included several cabinet members among its adherents.\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:Sudan Farras fresco of cathedral 22dez2005.jpg|thumb|right|A fresco showing the birth of Jesus, in [[Faras]] cathedral.]]\nChristianity reached what is now northern [[Sudan]], then called [[Nubia]], by about the end of the first century after Christ.\n\nIt greatly developed under the influence of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://www.nubianet.org/about/about_history10.html Christianity in Nubia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303051552/http://www.nubianet.org/about/about_history10.html |date=3 March 2012 }}. nubianet.org</ref> Indeed, Byzantine architecture influenced most of the Christian churches in lower Nubia<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey S.

Beginning with the imposition of strict ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid 1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time, however, the European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipe]]s, were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]].\n\n==Clothing==\n<gallery>\nImage:Sudan - smiling lady.jpg\nImage:Piramidoj en Meroe (Sudano) 006.jpg\nImage:Deserto_Sudan_1.jpg\n</gallery>\n\nGiven the cultural and religious differences within the country, Sudanese clothing varies among the different parts and peoples of Sudan. However, most individual Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn in Sudan is the [[jalabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]. The jalabiya is accompanied by a large scarf worn by men, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences. Another traditional piece of clothing is the [[toub]] (pronounced to\u028ab). This is a large piece of fabric that measures around (4.5mx120m)or (4.5x110)depending on the way that its going to be worn is it the traditional way or the modern way ,basically you just wrapped around the body in a particular way. Something is usually worn under it to prevent exposure of private areas.

This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.<ref name=\"Beijing Review\"/>\n<!--\nBefore the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's \"blue territories\", could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n-->\n\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan.

The Vietnamese broke Champa's power in [[Cham\u2013Vietnamese War (1471)|an invasion of Champa in 1471]], and then finally conquered the last remnants of the Cham people in an invasion in 1832. A Cham named Katip Suma who received Islamic education in Kelantan declared a [[Jihad]] against the Vietnamese, and fighting continued until the Vietnamese crushed the remnants of the resistance in 1835. The Cham organization Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Champa was part of the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]], which waged war against the Vietnamese for independence in the [[Vietnam War]] along with the [[Degar people|Montagnard]] and [[Khmer Krom]] minorities.

Vietnam has settled over a million ethnic Vietnamese on Montagnard lands in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. The Montagnard staged a massive protest against the Vietnamese in 2001, which led to the Vietnamese to forcefully crush the uprising and seal the entire area off to foreigners.\n\nThe Vietnamese government fears that evidence of [[Champa]]'s influence over the disputed area in the South China Sea would bring attention to human rights violations and killings of ethnic minorities in Vietnam such as in the 2001 and 2004 uprisings, and lead to the issue of Cham autonomy being brought into the dispute, since the Vietnamese conquered the Hindu and Muslim [[Cham people]] in a war in 1832, and the Vietnamese continue to destroy evidence of Cham culture and artifacts left behind, plundering or building on top of Cham temples, building farms over them, banning Cham religious practices, and omitting references to the destroyed Cham capital of Song Luy in the 1832 invasion in history books and tourist guides. The situation of Cham compared to ethnic Vietnamese is substandard, lacking water and electricity and living in houses made out of mud.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bray |first=Adam |last2= |first2= |date= June 16, 2014 |title= The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/ |archiveurl=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/169-the-cham-descendants-of-ancient-rulers-of-south-china-sea-watch-maritime-dispute-from-sidelines|archivedate=2014|journal= National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Both Hindu and Muslim Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days. A normal trip takes 13 to 15 hours, navigating between dangerous reefs and banks, through a distance of {{convert|186|nmi|km}}. -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Administrative divisions of

On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages.

The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS).

A Cham named Katip Suma who received Islamic education in Kelantan declared a [[Jihad]] against the Vietnamese, and fighting continued until the Vietnamese crushed the remnants of the resistance in 1835. The Cham organization Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Champa was part of the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]], which waged war against the Vietnamese for independence in the [[Vietnam War]] along with the [[Degar people|Montagnard]] and [[Khmer Krom]] minorities. The last remaining FULRO insurgents surrendered to the United Nations in 1992. Vietnam has settled over a million ethnic Vietnamese on Montagnard lands in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]]. The Montagnard staged a massive protest against the Vietnamese in 2001, which led to the Vietnamese to forcefully crush the uprising and seal the entire area off to foreigners.\n\nThe Vietnamese government fears that evidence of [[Champa]]'s influence over the disputed area in the South China Sea would bring attention to human rights violations and killings of ethnic minorities in Vietnam such as in the 2001 and 2004 uprisings, and lead to the issue of Cham autonomy being brought into the dispute, since the Vietnamese conquered the Hindu and Muslim [[Cham people]] in a war in 1832, and the Vietnamese continue to destroy evidence of Cham culture and artifacts left behind, plundering or building on top of Cham temples, building farms over them, banning Cham religious practices, and omitting references to the destroyed Cham capital of Song Luy in the 1832 invasion in history books and tourist guides. The situation of Cham compared to ethnic Vietnamese is substandard, lacking water and electricity and living in houses made out of mud.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bray |first=Adam |last2= |first2= |date= June 16, 2014 |title= The Cham: Descendants of Ancient Rulers of South China Sea Watch Maritime Dispute From Sidelines |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140616-south-china-sea-vietnam-china-cambodia-champa/ |archiveurl=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/169-the-cham-descendants-of-ancient-rulers-of-south-china-sea-watch-maritime-dispute-from-sidelines|archivedate=2014|journal= National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Both Hindu and Muslim Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Th\u00e0nh T\u00edn and Ph\u01b0\u01a1c Nh\u01a1n villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days. A normal trip takes 13 to 15 hours, navigating between dangerous reefs and banks, through a distance of {{convert|186|nmi|km}}. -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[South China Sea Islands]]\n** [[James Shoal]]\n** [[Macclesfield Bank]]\n** [[Paracel Islands]]\n** [[Scarborough Shoal]]\n** [[Spratly Islands]]\n* [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea]]\n* [[Kalayaan, Palawan|Kalayaan]], [[Palawan]], [[Philippines]]\n* [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa District|Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa]], [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province|Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a]], [[Vietnam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sansha.gov.cn Sansha Government] {{in lang|zh-cn}}\n* [https://archive.today/20121127061700/http://en.hainan.gov.cn/englishgov/AboutHaiNan/200904/t20090419_1366.html Administrative divisions of Hainan Province]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071117131114/http://xnzsha.hainan.gov.cn/ Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412060318/http://yjs.hainan.gov.cn/web/2001/main/sx_01_21.htm Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority Woody Island Census Town]\n* [http://www.xzqh.org/quhua/46hn/9037.htm Subdivision Information of the Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority]\n* [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/305969/us-criticises-china-garrison US criticises China garrison]\n\n{{South China Sea}}\n{{Sansha topics}}\n{{Hainan topics}}\n{{Hainan}}\n{{Metropolitan cities of China}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sansha]]\n[[Category:2012 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 2012]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Hainan]]\n", "name_user": "CentreLeftRight", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansha"}

The [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] year was the Saints' first-ever winning season. The Saints also qualified for the postseason for the first time, riding largely on a nine-game winning streak to close the season. The Saints earned the second-best record in the NFL in 1987, but were in the same division as the team with the best record, [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]], and entered the playoffs as a wild card. However, they were soundly defeated at home by [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]] in the Wild Card round of the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], by a score of 44\u201310. The Vikings entered the playoffs with an 8\u20137 record and needed the Dallas Cowboys to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals on the final day of the season to qualify. The Saints' first winning season would be followed by another six consecutive non-losing seasons. Before the 1987 season, the Saints' non-losing seasons had consisted of only two 8\u20138 seasons, in [[1979 New Orleans Saints season|1979]] and [[1983 New Orleans Saints season|1983]].

The [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] year was the Saints' first-ever winning season. The Saints also qualified for the postseason for the first time, riding largely on a nine-game winning streak to close the season. The Saints earned the second-best record in the NFL in 1987, but were in the same division as the team with the best record, [[1987 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]], and entered the playoffs as a wild card. However, they were soundly defeated at home by [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]] in the Wild Card round of the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], by a score of 44\u201310. The Vikings entered the playoffs with an 8\u20137 record and needed the Dallas Cowboys to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals on the final day of the season to qualify. The Saints' first winning season would be followed by another six consecutive non-losing seasons. Before the 1987 season, the Saints' non-losing seasons had consisted of only two 8\u20138 seasons, in [[1979 New Orleans Saints season|1979]] and [[1983 New Orleans Saints season|1983]]. Head coach [[Jim E.

It was founded by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist Fathers]] in response to the lack of Catholic education for young men in Hawkes Bay. It was also to be a brother school to the already established all girls [[Sacred Heart College, Napier]], some 20&nbsp;km north.\n\nEnrolment proved so popular that the school needed to expand, so in 1956, with an allotment of donated land, St John's College moved to its present site on Jervois St, Mayfair. Old boys recall that on the day of the move, they carried the school furniture, back and forth to the new premises over 3&nbsp;km away, and still had to attend afternoon class. The roll grew more slowly after that. Part of the problem was the transportation of students from around the Hawkes Bay region as many students from Napier found it difficult to reach school before school bus lines were established. There were even calls to make both Sacred Heart and St Johns co-ed, to prevent Napier boys travelling to Hastings and Hastings girls travelling to Napier. Today this issue is non-existent, although around 40% of St John's College students come from the Napier area.\n\nIn 1975, St John's College was \"integrated\" into the state system under the ''Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3690096234&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7b3AAAD062%7d&softpage=DOC|title=Education Review Report|work=Education Review Office|date=February 2006|access-date=18 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023004/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/libraries/contents/om_isapi.dll?clientID=3690096234&hitsperheading=on&infobase=pal_statutes.nfo&record=%7b3AAAD062%7d&softpage=DOC|archive-date=16 July 2011|df=}}</ref> \"on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them\".\n\nOver time St John's quietly expanded with the addition of new buildings and land. The 1990s saw drastic changes with the completion of 'The Centre' (the school gymnasium), the music suite and geography room, and the purchase of the old Firth industrial land to expand the playing fields. This gave St John's an additional rugby field, a new area for cricket nets, and another drive way towards Karamu road with additional car spaces.

The site layout has all academic buildings close to the main road and are named after former rectors of the school, for example 'The Dowling Block' which contains the Library and Humanities subjects. Behind the buildings are the school playing fields, which separate the swimming pool and the tennis courts from the academic areas.\n\n===Facilities===\nCurrent facilities of St John's include:\n*'The Centre', which is a gymnasium used for sports, games and [[physical education]] (PE) classes. Also used as the venue for weekly Wednesday assemblies and other official school occasions such as college masses and the Year 12 Leavers' Mass.\n*The Kenneth Guthrie Pool, located at the rear of the school property, next to the tennis courts.\n*Playing Fields, which consists of a variety of interconnected fields containing two rugby fields, a cricket pitch and soccer field, field hockey students practice at Park Island Sports Ground in Napier.\n\n==St John's tradition==\n\n=== Crest ===\n\nThe school [[Coat of arms|crest]] incorporates four symbols. It incorporates the major elements of Archbishop Redwood's Crest the star and the AM as well as the \"Redwood Cross\" i.e. the cross on top of a pile of rocks. The five 5 pointed stars that sits in the upper left side representing the [[Virgin Mary]]; originally the star was a six-pointed star but quickly was corrected into the correct version. The second is the cross that appears on the right side of the crest. It is the [[Calvary]] Cross, which represents the place where Jesus was crucified while also representing Christianity. Third directly below the star, is an A imposed over an M, a common symbol for [[Ave Maria]], which is Latin for Hail Mary. The fourth is the [[Saint symbology|Eagle]] situated across the top section of the shield, which represents [[John the Apostle|St John]]. In the shield's compartment is the College's motto.\n\n=== House system ===\nThe current house system was bought into the College in 1999, and was named after early Catholic missionaries who came to New Zealand. All except Redwood are French, and staff and students pronounce them in the traditional ways. The names and colours of the St John's College Houses are:\n\n* '''Colin''' \u2013 green\n* '''Forest''' \u2013 yellow\n* '''Redwood''' \u2013 red\n* '''Reignier''' \u2013 blue\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n=== Academic results ===\nThe number of students achieving national qualifications is well above the national mean for similar decile schools at all levels of NCEA.  The percentage of students obtaining NCEA Level 1 increased from 61% in 2003 to 66% in 2004.  Levels of attainment in the literacy requirement have recently improved to the current level of over 91%.  Achievement in university entrance results has steadily improved over the past three years and is above the national average for schools at this decile level.\nThe percentage of Year 12 M\u0101ori students leaving school with qualifications is well above the national rates for schools in this decile.  Retention of M\u0101ori students to complete their Year 12 studies is high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ero.govt.nz/ERO/reppub.nsf/Institution/0C81B79B808D45E2CC2571220004ABBD/$File/226.htm?OpenElement#_Toc128809659|title=Education Review Report|work=Education Review Office|date=February 2006|accessdate=18 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n==Co-curriculum==\n\n=== Sport ===\nPlaying a winter sport is compulsory for junior students (Year 9 and 10) to encourage social integration into the college environment. Although sport is not compulsory in the senior years, the majority of seniors participate in sport with large numbers competing in the Summer sports offered. \n[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is the most popular sport at the college and enjoys a large following from St John's old boys. There are at least 8 teams, which does not include special teams selected for events like the Under 15s tournament and the Father Fisher trophy.\nSoccer is widely played at the college, and with [[hockey]] make up the rest of the majority of winter sport participants. There are also teams for [[basketball]], [[badminton]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[table tennis]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], swimming, [[tennis]], [[orienteering]], [[canoe polo]] and [[Touch football (rugby league)|touch]]. [[Cricket]] is by far the largest sport during the summer. The Cricket teams are usually divided into Hastings or Napier teams in lower grades.\n\nMany inter school sporting events take place, most notably with Catholic schools around the lower North Island. The main rivalry remains with other Marist Schools [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St Pat's Silverstream]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Wellington|St Pat's Town]] in [[Wellington]], [[Hato Paora College|Hato Paora]] in the [[Manawatu-Wanganui|Manawatu]], and [[St. John's College, Hamilton|St Johns]] in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].\n\n===Religion===\nAs a Catholic school, religion plays an important factor in the day-to-day lives of St John's College students. As well as participating in Masses and Chapel, prayers are formally conducted at staff meetings, in form classes to start the day, at assemblies and at school meetings.\n\n===Kapa Haka===\nSt John's College has a long and proud tradition of [[Kapa haka]]. Along with [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] studies, students actively participate in M\u0101ori cultural activities like the inter house Haka competition.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Greg Cooper (rugby union)|Greg Cooper]] \u2013 former All Black.\n* [[Matthew Cooper (rugby union)|Matt Cooper]] \u2013 former All Black.\n* [[Air New Zealand|Greg Foran]] \u2013 Air New Zealand CEO, former President and CEO [[Walmart]] USA.\n* [[Paul Martin (bishop)|Paul Martin]] (born 1967) \u2013 Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]].\n*[[Dean Parker]] - Arts Foundation Laureate\n*[[Brian Roche (business executive)|Brian Roche]] {{post-nominals|country=NZL|KNZM|size=85%}} \u2013 business executive.\n* [[John Scott (architect)|John Scott]] \u2013 architect.\n*[[Gerard van Bohemen|Gerard Van Bohemen]] \u2013 Justice of the High Court of New Zealand, former Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations.\n*[[Michael Wintringham]] \u2013 former State Services Commissioner.\n*[[Eric Young (broadcaster)|Eric Young]] \u2013 lead news anchor, [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime News]], New Zealand.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.stjohns.school.nz/ Official site]\n\n{{Schools in Hawke's Bay}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint John's College, Hastings}}\n[[Category:Boys' schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1941]]\n[[Category:Schools in Hastings, New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|other schools of the same name|Saint John's College (disambiguation){{!}}Saint John's College}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2019}}\n \n{{Infobox school\n|name         = St John's College\n|image        = \n|motto        = {{ubl|{{lang-la|[[List of Latin phrases (M-O)|Opere et Veritate]]}}|(\"In Word and in Deed\")}}\n|established  = 1941; {{years ago|1941}} years ago\n|type         = [[Secondary education in New Zealand|State Integrated]], [[Single-sex school|Single-sex]], [[Day school|Day]], Secondary (Year 9\u201313)\n|denomination = [[Catholic Church in New Zealand|Catholic]] \n|principal    = Paul Melloy\n|fees         = \n|city         = [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]]\n|state        = [[Hawkes Bay]]\n|country      = [[New Zealand]] {{flagicon|New Zealand}}\n|coordinates  = {{coord|39|38|22|S|176|51|22|E|display=inline,title}}\n|roll = {{NZ school roll data|226|y||y}} <small>({{NZ school roll data|||y}})</small>\n|num_employ   = ~ 35 (full time)\n|decile =  4K<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.minedu.govt.nz/~/media/MinEdu/Files/EducationSectors/PrimarySecondary/SchoolOpsResourcing/OperationalFundingDeciles/DecileChanges_20142015.xls |title= Decile Change 2014 to 2015 for State & State Integrated Schools |publisher= Ministry of Education |accessdate= 12 February 2015}}</ref>\n|MOE =  226\n|revenue      = \n|colours      = Maroon, blue and white\n|homepage     = [http://www.stjohns.school.nz/ www.stjohns.school.nz]\n}}\n\n'''St John's College''' is a [[Secondary education in New Zealand|State Integrated]], [[Catholic Church in New Zealand|Catholic]], [[Day School]] for boys, located in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], a provincial city in [[Hawkes Bay]], New Zealand.\n\nFounded in 1941 by the [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marist Fathers]], St John's College has a non-selective enrolment policy (although gives preference to students from Catholic families) and currently caters for approximately 450 students from Year 9 (3rd Form) to Year 13 (7th Form).\n\nSt John's College has a diverse, multicultural roll.

In the shield's compartment is the College's motto.\n\n=== House system ===\nThe current house system was bought into the College in 1999, and was named after early Catholic missionaries who came to New Zealand. All except Redwood are French, and staff and students pronounce them in the traditional ways. The names and colours of the St John's College Houses are:\n\n* '''Colin''' \u2013 green\n* '''Forest''' \u2013 yellow\n* '''Redwood''' \u2013 red\n* '''Reignier''' \u2013 blue\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n=== Academic results ===\nThe number of students achieving national qualifications is well above the national mean for similar decile schools at all levels of NCEA.  The percentage of students obtaining NCEA Level 1 increased from 61% in 2003 to 66% in 2004.  Levels of attainment in the literacy requirement have recently improved to the current level of over 91%.  Achievement in university entrance results has steadily improved over the past three years and is above the national average for schools at this decile level.\nThe percentage of Year 12 M\u0101ori students leaving school with qualifications is well above the national rates for schools in this decile.  Retention of M\u0101ori students to complete their Year 12 studies is high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ero.govt.nz/ERO/reppub.nsf/Institution/0C81B79B808D45E2CC2571220004ABBD/$File/226.htm?OpenElement#_Toc128809659|title=Education Review Report|work=Education Review Office|date=February 2006|accessdate=18 July 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\n==Co-curriculum==\n\n=== Sport ===\nPlaying a winter sport is compulsory for junior students (Year 9 and 10) to encourage social integration into the college environment. Although sport is not compulsory in the senior years, the majority of seniors participate in sport with large numbers competing in the Summer sports offered. \n[[Rugby union|Rugby]] is the most popular sport at the college and enjoys a large following from St John's old boys. There are at least 8 teams, which does not include special teams selected for events like the Under 15s tournament and the Father Fisher trophy.\nSoccer is widely played at the college, and with [[hockey]] make up the rest of the majority of winter sport participants. There are also teams for [[basketball]], [[badminton]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[table tennis]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], swimming, [[tennis]], [[orienteering]], [[canoe polo]] and [[Touch football (rugby league)|touch]]. [[Cricket]] is by far the largest sport during the summer. The Cricket teams are usually divided into Hastings or Napier teams in lower grades.\n\nMany inter school sporting events take place, most notably with Catholic schools around the lower North Island. The main rivalry remains with other Marist Schools [[St. Patrick's College, Silverstream|St Pat's Silverstream]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Wellington|St Pat's Town]] in [[Wellington]], [[Hato Paora College|Hato Paora]] in the [[Manawatu-Wanganui|Manawatu]], and [[St. John's College, Hamilton|St Johns]] in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].\n\n===Religion===\nAs a Catholic school, religion plays an important factor in the day-to-day lives of St John's College students. As well as participating in Masses and Chapel, prayers are formally conducted at staff meetings, in form classes to start the day, at assemblies and at school meetings.\n\n===Kapa Haka===\nSt John's College has a long and proud tradition of [[Kapa haka]]. Along with [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] studies, students actively participate in M\u0101ori cultural activities like the inter house Haka competition.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Greg Cooper (rugby union)|Greg Cooper]] \u2013 former All Black.\n* [[Matthew Cooper (rugby union)|Matt Cooper]] \u2013 former All Black.\n* [[Air New Zealand|Greg Foran]] \u2013 Air New Zealand CEO, former President and CEO [[Walmart]] USA.\n* [[Paul Martin (bishop)|Paul Martin]] (born 1967) \u2013 Roman Catholic Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Christchurch|Christchurch]].\n*[[Dean Parker]] - Arts Foundation Laureate\n*[[Brian Roche (business executive)|Sir Brian Roche]] \u2013 business executive.\n* [[John Scott (architect)|John Scott]] \u2013 architect.\n*[[Gerard van Bohemen|Gerard Van Bohemen]] \u2013 Justice of the High Court of New Zealand, former Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United Nations.\n*[[Michael Wintringham]] \u2013 former State Services Commissioner.\n*[[Eric Young (broadcaster)|Eric Young]] \u2013 lead news anchor, [[Prime Television New Zealand|Prime News]], New Zealand.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.stjohns.school.nz/ Official site]\n\n{{Schools in Hawke's Bay}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint John's College, Hastings}}\n[[Category:Boys' schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1941]]\n[[Category:Schools in Hastings, New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Catholic secondary schools in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:1941 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Emendment", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable alumni:no honorific", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Hastings"}

Richter has produced [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as [[photorealistic]] paintings, and also [[photographs]] and [[Glass_art|glass]] pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction. \n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nRichter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]],<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=3}}</ref> and grew up in Reichenau, [[Lower Silesia]] (now [[Bogatynia]], Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the [[Upper Lusatia]]n countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard's mother, Hildegard Sch\u00f6nfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard's father, Ernst Alfred Sch\u00f6nfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard's father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter struggling to maintain a position in the new Nationalist Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard's younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau's location in the countryside.<ref name=ElgerP4>{{harv|Elger|2009|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies.<ref name=ElgerP4 /> In 1942, Gerhard was conscripted into the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', but by the end of the war he was still too young to be an official member of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>{{harv|Richter|Harten|1986|p=9}}</ref> In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=6}}</ref> Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, who was schizophrenic, was starved to death in the [[Nazi Euthanasia Programme|Nazi euthanasia]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/biography|title=Early Years \u00bb Biography \u00bb Gerhard Richter|website=www.gerhard-richter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nRichter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in [[Zittau]], and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter.<ref name=\"Elgerp10\">{{harv|Elger|2009|p=10}}</ref> In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as \"too bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Elgerp10\" /> He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were [[Karl von Appen]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinz Lohmar|de}} and [[Will Grohmann]].\n\n===Relationships===\nRichter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor [[Isa Genzken]], in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, [[Sabine Moritz]] after they were married in 1995.<!-- See [[WP:BLPNAME]] for guidelines about family -->\n\n===Early career===\nIn the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (''Communion with Picasso'', 1955) for the [[refectory]] of his Academy of Arts as part of his [[B.A.]] Another mural entitled ''Lebensfreude'' (Joy of life) followed at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] for his diploma. It was intended to produce an effect \"similar to that of wallpaper or tapestry\".<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|pp=15\u201318}}</ref>\n[[File:Gerhard Richter by Lothar Wolleh.jpg|thumb|left|Gerhard Richter c. 1970, photograph by [[Lothar Wolleh]]]]\n\nFrom 1957 to 1961 Richter worked as a master trainee in the academy and took commissions for the then state of East Germany. During this time, he worked intensively on murals like ''{{Lang|de|Arbeiterkampf}}'' (Workers' struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress [[Angelica Domr\u00f6se]] and of Richter's first wife Ema), on various self-portraits and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name ''{{Lang|de|Stadtbild}}'' (Townscape, 1956).\n\nTogether with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from [[East germany|East]] to [[West Germany]] two months before the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after [[German reunification]], two \"windows\" of the wall painting ''Joy of life'' (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state. \n\nIn West Germany Richter began to study at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] under [[Karl Otto G\u00f6tz]] together with [[Sigmar Polke]], Werner Hilsing, [[HA Schult]],<ref>[http://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/private-finanzen/Euro-Interview-Exklusiv-Muellkuenstler-HA-Schult-Ich-moechte-Unsterblichkeit-Und-die-ist-nicht-kaeuflich-1853055 Axel Griesch, \"M\u00fcllk\u00fcnstler HA Schult: Ich m\u00f6chte Unsterblichkeit.

For ''[[48 Portraits|Forty-eight Portraits]]'' (1971\u201372), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Jean Sibelius]], and of writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Franz Kafka]].<ref name=\"MOMA4907\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4907 Gerhard Richter] MoMA | The Collection</ref>\n\nFrom his \"Writings\", the following refer to quotations regarding photography, its relationship with painting, and the \"blur\":\n* \"The photograph is the most perfect picture. It does not change; it is absolute, and therefore autonomous, unconditional, devoid of style. Both in its ways of informing, and in what it informs of, it is my source.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 31.</ref>\n* \"I\u2019m not trying to imitate a photograph; I\u2019m trying to make one.

''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 73.</ref>\n* \"I don't create blurs. Blurring is not the most important thing; nor is it an identity tag for my pictures. When I dissolve demarcations and create transition, this is not in order to destroy the representation, or to make it more artistic or less precise. The flowing transitions, the smooth equalizing surface, clarify the content and make the representation credible (an \"alla prima\" impasto would be too reminiscent of painting, and would destroy the illusion).\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n* \"I blur things to make everything equally important and equally unimportant. I blur things so that they do not look artistic or craftsmanlike but technological, smooth and perfect. I blur things to make all the parts a closer fit. Perhaps I also blur out the excess of unimportant information.\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n\nMany of these paintings are made in a multi-step process of representations. He starts with a [[photograph]], which he has found or taken himself, and projects it onto his [[canvas]], where he traces it for exact form. Taking his color palette from the photograph, he paints to replicate the look of the original picture. His hallmark \"blur\" is achieved sometimes with a light touch of a soft brush, sometimes a hard smear by an aggressive pull with a squeegee.\n\nFrom around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter's two portraits of ''Betty'', his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled ''IG'' were made in 1993 and depict the artist's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]].

Each composition is most commonly based on a photograph taken by Richter in his own studio. Influenced by old master vanitas painters such as [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n]], the artist began to experiment with arrangements of candles and skulls placed in varying degrees of natural light, sitting atop otherwise barren tables.

Buchloch in 1986, Richter was asked about his \"Monochrome Grey Pictures and Abstract Pictures\" and their connection with the artists [[Yves Klein]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]].

Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist's tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''Firenze'' continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter.

This work was published in 2004 as a book entitled ''War Cut''.\n\nIn November 2008, Richter began a series in which he applied ink droplets to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink's natural tendency to bloom and creep. The resulting ''November'' sheets are regarded as a significant departure from his previous watercolours in that the pervasive soaking of ink into wet paper produced double-sided works. Sometimes the uppermost sheets bled into others, generating a sequentially developing series of images.<ref>Alexander Adams (13 June 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/At+the+top+of+his+game/29918 At the top of his game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810025954/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/At+the+top+of+his+game/29918 |date=10 August 2013 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> In a few cases Richter applied lacquer to one side of the sheet, or drew pencil lines across the patches of colour.<ref>Dieter Schwarz (14 February 2013), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/picture-preview-gerhard-richters-previously-unseen-november-series-8495683.html Picture preview: Gerhard Richter's previously unseen November series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202084715/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/picture-preview-gerhard-richters-previously-unseen-november-series-8495683.html |date=2 February 2017 }} ''[[The Independent]]''.</ref>\n\n===Color chart paintings===\nAs early as 1966, Richter had made paintings based on colour charts, using the rectangles of colour as found objects in an apparently limitless variety of hue; these culminated in 1973\u20134 in a series of large-format pictures such as ''256 Colours''.<ref name=\"MOMA4907\" /> Richter painted three series of Color Chart paintings between 1966 and 1974, each series growing more ambitious in their attempt to create through their purely arbitrary arrangement of colors.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4288634 Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), 4096 Farben, Sale 1373] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023193139/http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4288634 |date=23 October 2012 }} Christie's London, 11 May 2004</ref> The artist began his investigations into the complex permutations of color charts in 1966, with a small painting entitled ''10 Colors''.<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/92487.html Gerhard Richter: 180 Farben (180 Colors)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207120241/http://philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/92487.html |date=7 February 2011 }} Philadelphia Museum of Art Collection</ref> The charts provided anonymous and impersonal source material, a way for Richter to disassociate color from any traditional, descriptive, symbolic or expressive end. When he began to make these paintings, Richter had his friend [[Blinky Palermo]] randomly call out colors, which Richter then adopted for his work. Chance thus plays its role in the creation of his first series.\n\nReturning to color charts in the 1970s, Richter changed his focus from the readymade to the conceptual system, developing mathematical procedures for mixing colours and chance operations for their placement.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/colour-chart-reinventing-colour-1950-today ''Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031023902/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/colour-chart-reinventing-colour-1950-today |date=31 October 2014 }} Tate Liverpool, 29 May through 13 September 2009</ref> The range of the colors he employed was determined by a mathematical system for mixing the primary colors in graduated amounts. Each color was then randomly ordered to create the resultant composition and form of the painting. Richter's second series of Color Charts was begun in 1971 and consisted of only five paintings. In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.\n\nRichter's ''4900 Colours'' from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color. It was produced at the same time he developed his design for the south transept window of [[Cologne Cathedral]]. ''4900 Colours'' consists of 196 panels in 25 colors that can be reassembled in 11 variations \u2013 from a single expansive surface to multiple small-format fields.

For the front of the arena, they proposed an array of glass windows in twenty-seven different colors; each color would appear fifty times, with the distribution determined randomly. In 1981, for a two-person show with [[Georg Baselitz]] in D\u00fcsseldorf, Richter produced the first of the monumental transparent mirrors that appear intermittently thereafter in his oeuvre; the mirrors are significantly larger than Richter's paintings and feature adjustable steel mounts.

Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the [[Praemium Imperiale]], Japan, 1997; the [[Golden Lion]] of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the [[Wolf Prize]] in Israel in 1994/5; the Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, M\u00f6nchehaus-Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Vienna, 1985; the [[Arnold Bode]] Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007.\n\n===Influence===\nAmong the students who studied with Richter at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] between 1971 and 1994 were [[Ludger Gerdes]], [[Hans-J\u00f6rg Holubitschka]], [[Bernard Lokai]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Thomas Struth]], Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]]. He is known to have influenced [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Christopher Wool]] and [[Johan Andersson (artist) | Johan Andersson]].\n\nHe has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians. [[Sonic Youth]] used a painting of his for the cover art for their album ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' in 1988. He was a fan of the band and did not charge for the use of his image.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The original, over {{convert|7|m}} square, is now showcased in Sonic Youth's studio in NYC.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Don DeLillo]]'s short story \"Baader-Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Richter has produced [[Abstract art|abstract]] as well as [[photorealistic]] paintings, and also [[photographs]] and [[Glass_art|glass]] pieces. He is widely regarded as one of the most important contemporary German artists and several of his works have set record prices at auction. \n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\nRichter was born in Hospital Dresden-Neustadt in [[Dresden]], [[Saxony]],<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=3}}</ref> and grew up in Reichenau, [[Lower Silesia]] (now [[Bogatynia]], Poland), and in Waltersdorf (Zittauer Gebirge), in the [[Upper Lusatia]]n countryside, where his father worked as a village teacher. Gerhard's mother, Hildegard Sch\u00f6nfelder, gave birth to him at the age of 25. Hildegard's father, Ernst Alfred Sch\u00f6nfelder, at one time was considered a gifted pianist. Ernst moved the family to Dresden after taking up the family enterprise of brewing and eventually went bankrupt. Once in Dresden, Hildegard trained as a bookseller, and in doing so realized a passion for literature and music. Gerhard's father, Horst Richter, was a mathematics and physics student at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. The two were married in 1931.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter struggling to maintain a position in the new Nationalist Socialist education system, Horst found a position in Reichenau. Gerhard's younger sister, Gisela, was born there in 1936. Horst and Hildegard were able to remain primarily apolitical due to Reichenau's location in the countryside.<ref name=ElgerP4>{{harv|Elger|2009|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Horst, being a teacher, was eventually forced to join the National Socialist Party. He never became an avid supporter of Nazism, and was not required to attend party rallies.<ref name=ElgerP4 /> In 1942, Gerhard was conscripted into the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', but by the end of the war he was still too young to be an official member of the [[Hitler Youth]].<ref>{{harv|Richter|Harten|1986|p=9}}</ref> In 1943, Hildegard moved the family to Waltersdorf, and was later forced to sell her piano.<ref>{{harv|Elger|2009|p=6}}</ref> Two brothers of Hildegard died as soldiers in the war and a sister, who was schizophrenic, was starved to death in the [[Nazi Euthanasia Programme|Nazi euthanasia]] program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gerhard-richter.com/en/biography|title=Early Years \u00bb Biography \u00bb Gerhard Richter|website=www.gerhard-richter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nRichter left school after 10th grade and apprenticed as an advertising and stage-set painter, before studying at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. In 1948, he finished vocational high school in [[Zittau]], and, between 1949 and 1951, successively worked as an apprentice with a sign painter and as a painter.<ref name=\"Elgerp10\">{{harv|Elger|2009|p=10}}</ref> In 1950, his application for study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts was rejected as \"too bourgeois\".<ref name=\"Elgerp10\" /> He finally began his studies at the Academy in 1951. His teachers there were [[Karl von Appen]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinz Lohmar|de}} and [[Will Grohmann]].\n\n===Relationships===\nRichter married Marianne Eufinger in 1957; she gave birth to his first daughter. He married his second wife, the sculptor [[Isa Genzken]], in 1982. Richter had two sons and a daughter with his third wife, [[Sabine Moritz]] after they were married in 1995.<!-- See [[WP:BLPNAME]] for guidelines about family -->\n\n===Early career===\nIn the early days of his career, he prepared a wall painting (''Communion with Picasso'', 1955) for the [[refectory]] of his Academy of Arts as part of his [[B.A.]] Another mural entitled ''Lebensfreude'' (Joy of life) followed at the [[German Hygiene Museum]] for his diploma.

During this time, he worked intensively on murals like ''{{Lang|de|Arbeiterkampf}}'' (Workers' struggle), on oil paintings (e.g. portraits of the East German actress [[Angelica Domr\u00f6se]] and of Richter's first wife Ema), on various self-portraits and on a panorama of Dresden with the neutral name ''{{Lang|de|Stadtbild}}'' (Townscape, 1956).\n\nTogether with his wife Marianne, Richter escaped from [[East germany|East]] to [[West Germany]] two months before the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961. Both his wall paintings in the Academy of Arts and the Hygiene Museum were then painted over for ideological reasons. Much later, after [[German reunification]], two \"windows\" of the wall painting ''Joy of life'' (1956) would be uncovered in the stairway of the German Hygiene Museum, but these were later covered over when it was decided to restore the Museum to its original 1930 state. \n\nIn West Germany Richter began to study at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] under [[Karl Otto G\u00f6tz]] together with [[Sigmar Polke]], Werner Hilsing, [[HA Schult]],<ref>[http://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/private-finanzen/Euro-Interview-Exklusiv-Muellkuenstler-HA-Schult-Ich-moechte-Unsterblichkeit-Und-die-ist-nicht-kaeuflich-1853055 Axel Griesch, \"M\u00fcllk\u00fcnstler HA Schult: Ich m\u00f6chte Unsterblichkeit.

Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press, 1995. 13.</ref>\n\n===Photo-paintings and the \"blur\"===\nRichter created various painting pictures from black-and-white photographs during the 1960s and early 1970s, basing them on a variety of sources: newspapers and books, sometimes incorporating their captions, (as in ''Helga Matura'' (1966)); private snapshots; aerial views of towns and mountains, (''Cityscape Madrid'' (1968) and Alps (1968)); seascapes (1969\u201370); and a large multipart work made for the German Pavilion in the 1972 [[Venice Biennale]]. For ''Forty-eight Portraits'' (1971\u201372), he chose mainly the faces of composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Jean Sibelius]], and of writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Franz Kafka]].<ref name=\"MOMA4907\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4907 Gerhard Richter] MoMA | The Collection</ref>\n\nFrom his \"Writings\", the following refer to quotations regarding photography, its relationship with painting, and the \"blur\":\n* \"The photograph is the most perfect picture. It does not change; it is absolute, and therefore autonomous, unconditional, devoid of style. Both in its ways of informing, and in what it informs of, it is my source.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 31.</ref>\n* \"I\u2019m not trying to imitate a photograph; I\u2019m trying to make one. And if I disregard the assumption that a photograph is a piece of paper exposed to light, then I am practicing photography by other means.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist. ''The Daily Practice of Painting: Writings and Interviews, 1962\u20131993''. Cambridge, Massachusetts.: MIT Press, 1995. 73.</ref>\n* \"I don't create blurs. Blurring is not the most important thing; nor is it an identity tag for my pictures. When I dissolve demarcations and create transition, this is not in order to destroy the representation, or to make it more artistic or less precise. The flowing transitions, the smooth equalizing surface, clarify the content and make the representation credible (an \"alla prima\" impasto would be too reminiscent of painting, and would destroy the illusion).\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n* \"I blur things to make everything equally important and equally unimportant. I blur things so that they do not look artistic or craftsmanlike but technological, smooth and perfect. I blur things to make all the parts a closer fit. Perhaps I also blur out the excess of unimportant information.\"<ref name=\"Richter, Gerhard 1995\"/>\n\nMany of these paintings are made in a multi-step process of representations. He starts with a [[photograph]], which he has found or taken himself, and projects it onto his [[canvas]], where he traces it for exact form. Taking his color palette from the photograph, he paints to replicate the look of the original picture. His hallmark \"blur\" is achieved sometimes with a light touch of a soft brush, sometimes a hard smear by an aggressive pull with a squeegee.\n\nFrom around 1964, Richter made a number of portraits of dealers, collectors, artists and others connected with his immediate professional circle. Richter's two portraits of ''Betty'', his daughter, were made in 1977 and 1988 respectively; the three portraits titled ''IG'' were made in 1993 and depict the artist's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]]. ''Lesende'' (1994) portrays [[Sabine Moritz]], whom Richter married in 1995, shown absorbed in the pages of a magazine.<ref name=NPG>[http://www.npg.org.uk:8080/richter/exhib5.htm Gerhard Richter ''Portraits'', 26 February \u2013 31 May 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924003610/http://www.npg.org.uk:8080/richter/exhib5.htm |date=24 September 2011 }} National Portrait Gallery, London</ref> Many of his realist paintings reflect on the history of National Socialism, creating paintings of family members who had been members, as well as victims of, the Nazi party.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gerhard-richter-panorama Gerhard Richter: Panorama, 6 October 2011 \u2013 8 January 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205020615/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gerhard-richter-panorama |date=5 December 2014 }} [[Tate Modern]], London</ref> From 1966, as well as those given to him by others, Richter began using photographs he had taken as the basis for portraits.<ref name=NPG /> In 1975, on the occasion of a show in D\u00fcsseldorf, [[Gilbert & George]] commissioned Richter to make a portrait of them.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=98381&searchid=9679 Gerhard Richter: Gilbert, George (381-1, 381-2), 1975] Tate Collection</ref>\n\nRichter began making prints in 1965.

Buchloch in 1986, Richter was asked about his \"Monochrome Grey Pictures and Abstract Pictures\" and their connection with the artists [[Yves Klein]] and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. The following are Richter's answers:\n<blockquote>The Grey Pictures were done at a time when there were monochrome paintings everywhere. I painted them nonetheless. ... Not Kelly, but Bob Ryman, [[Brice Marden]], [[Alan Charlton]], [[Yves Klein]] and many others.<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist.

Despite unnatural palettes, spaceless sheets of color, and obvious trails of the artist's tools, the abstract pictures often act like windows through which we see the landscape outside. As in his representational paintings, there is an equalization of illusion and paint. In those paintings, he reduces worldly images to mere incidents of Art. Similarly, in his abstract pictures, Richter exalts spontaneous, intuitive mark-making to a level of spatial logic and believability.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n''Firenze'' continues a cycle of 99 works conceived in the autumn of 1999 and executed in the same year and thereafter.

This work was published in 2004 as a book entitled ''War Cut''.\n\nIn November 2008, Richter began a series in which he applied ink droplets to wet paper, using alcohol and lacquer to extend and retard the ink's natural tendency to bloom and creep.

In the final series of Color Charts which preoccupied Richter throughout 1973 and 1974, additional elements to this permutational system of color production were added in the form of mixes of a light grey, a dark gray and later, a green.\n\nRichter's ''4900 Colours'' from 2007 consisted of bright monochrome squares that have been randomly arranged in a grid pattern to create stunning fields of kaleidoscopic color.

Today, many call Gerhard Richter the best living painter. In part, this comes from his ability to explore the medium at a time when many were heralding its death. Richter has been the recipient of numerous prominent awards, including the State Prize of the state North Rhine-Westphalia in 2000; the Wexner Prize, 1998; the [[Praemium Imperiale]], Japan, 1997; the [[Golden Lion]] of the 47th Biennale, Venice, 1997; the [[Wolf Prize]] in Israel in 1994/5; the Kaiserring Prize der Stadt Goslar, M\u00f6nchehaus-Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Goslar, Germany, 1988; the [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Vienna, 1985; the [[Arnold Bode]] Prize, Kassel, 1981; and the Junger Western Art Prize, Germany, 1961. He was made an honorary citizen of Cologne in April 2007.\n\n===Influence===\nAmong the students who studied with Richter at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] between 1971 and 1994 were [[Ludger Gerdes]], [[Hans-J\u00f6rg Holubitschka]], [[Bernard Lokai]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Thomas Struth]], Katrin Kneffel, Michael van Ofen, and Richter's second wife, [[Isa Genzken]]. He is known to have influenced [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Christopher Wool]] and [[Johan Andersson (artist) | Johan Andersson]].\n\nHe has also served as source of inspiration for writers and musicians. [[Sonic Youth]] used a painting of his for the cover art for their album ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' in 1988. He was a fan of the band and did not charge for the use of his image.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The original, over {{convert|7|m}} square, is now showcased in Sonic Youth's studio in NYC.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Don DeLillo]]'s short story \"Baader-Meinhof\" describes an encounter between two strangers at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

And this making is something that I can't grasp, or figure out and plan. That is why I keep on and on painting from photographs, because I can't make it out, because the only thing to do with photographs is paint from them. Because it attracts me to be so much at the mercy of a thing, to be so far from mastering it.\"<ref>Richter, Gerhard, and Hans Ulrich Obrist.

As with previous installments, the player controls the character [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed-camera]] perspective in [[combo (video gaming)|combo-based combat]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[puzzle video game|puzzle games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/|title=God of War III features 'first-person kills'|date=February 26, 2010|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=April 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112656/http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref> The enemies are an assortment of [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] creatures, including [[centaur]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[chimera (mythology)|chimeras]], [[cyclops|cyclopes]], [[satyr]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, [[cerberus]]es, and [[Gorgon]]s. The player must also climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and swing on ropes to proceed through the game. The puzzles included vary in difficulty: some puzzles only require objects to be placed in a specific position, while some require timing and precision, such as a puzzle with mechanics similar to ''[[Guitar Hero]]''.<ref name=\"manual\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|pp=6\u20137|ref=manual}}</ref> In addition to finding Gorgon Eyes and [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] Feathers of the previous games, Minotaur Horns are a new item to be found. Where the eyes and feathers increase the player's [[health (gaming)|health]] and [[magic point|magic]] meters, the horns increase the items meter, which allows further use of secondary weapons, called \"Items\".<ref name=\"p10\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=10|ref=manual}}</ref>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:GoW3 Kratos vs Hercules QTE.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot of fight|Kratos (left) battles boss character [[Hercules]] (right). This is an example of a [[quick time event|QTE]] sequence found in all ''God of War'' games; moving the left [[analog stick]] as shown by the orange arrow will allow him to continue his attack.]]\nKratos' main weapon is the Blades of Exile, replacing the Blades of [[Athena]] used in previous installments and the opening moments of the game. The weapon is a pair of blades attached to chains wrapped around the Kratos' wrists and forearms that can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons\u2014the Claws of [[Hades]], the [[Nemean lion|Nemean]] Cestus, and the [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] Whip\u2014with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of [[onyx]].<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nUnlike in previous games, magical abilities are learned with the acquisition of a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired:<ref name=\"manual\"/> the Bow of [[Apollo]], the Head of [[Helios]], and the Boots of [[Hermes]]. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used as a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=5|ref=manual}}</ref>\n\nThe relics [[Poseidon]]'s Trident, the [[Golden Fleece]], and [[Icarus]]' Wings acquired in previous games are retained and used to overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece used to deflect enemy attacks. Hades' Soul allows Kratos to swim in the River [[Styx]]. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in ''[[God of War II]]'', is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nNew additions to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a [[ranged weapon|ranged-grab]] maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away\u2014necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms\u2014and a simple grab allowing him to use a weak foe as a [[battering ram]]. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities like unlimited magic during [[New Game Plus|bonus play]].<ref name=\"p10\"/> The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks\u2014for example, killing all enemies without weapons in a limited amount of time. The player may [[unlockable (gaming)|unlock]] additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and [[concept art]] of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.<ref>{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=11|ref=manual}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting===\nAs with previous games, ''God of War III'' is set in an alternate version of [[ancient Greece]] populated by [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]], [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], [[Greek Heroic Age|heroes]], and other characters from Greek mythology. The events of the game are set between 2007's ''God of War II'' and 2018's ''[[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]]''. The game is set across several locations on [[Mount Olympus]], including the Tomb of [[Ares]], the ancient city of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the Path of [[Eos]], the [[Labyrinth]], several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and [[Hera]]'s Gardens, and the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] and [[Tartarus]].\n\nThe Tomb of Ares\u2014housing the former God of War's remains\u2014and the city of Olympia lie on the sides of Mount Olympus. Just beyond the city is the Path of Eos, a hidden cavern near the foot of Olympus. The Palace of the Gods is the home of the Olympians, and features the Forum (a small coliseum), Hera's Gardens, and the chambers of Aphrodite and Poseidon. The Labyrinth is a large aerial puzzle constructed by the architect [[Daedalus]] to imprison [[Pandora]] in the Caverns of Olympus, home of [[Scorpius#Mythology|Skorpius]] and its offspring. The Underworld, ruled by [[Hades]] and divided by the River Styx, is the realm of the dead. Hades' palace contains the remains of his wife, [[Persephone]], whom Kratos killed in ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus|Chains of Olympus]]''. The Underworld is also home to statues of the three Judges of the Underworld, who hold the Chain of Balance connecting the Underworld to Olympus. Tartarus is the prison of the dead where the Titan [[Cronus|Cronos]] was banished after Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box from Pandora's Temple in 2005's ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]''.\n\n===Characters===\n{{main|Characters of God of War}}\nKratos (voiced by [[Terrence C. Carson]]), the protagonist of the game, is a Spartan [[demigod]] warrior who became the God of War after killing Ares and seeks revenge on Zeus for his betrayal. Other characters include Greek gods such as Athena ([[Erin Torpey]]), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' mentor and ally; Zeus ([[Corey Burton]]), King of the Gods and the primary antagonist; Poseidon ([[Gideon Emery]]), God of the Sea; Hades ([[Clancy Brown]]), God of the Underworld; [[Hephaestus]] ([[Rip Torn]]), the [[Blacksmith|Smith God]]; Hermes ([[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]), Messenger of the Gods and the God of Speed and Commerce; Helios ([[Crispin Freeman]]), the Sun God; Hera ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), Queen of the Gods who controls plant life; and Aphrodite ([[April Stewart]]), Goddess of Love and Sexuality. Several Titans are featured, including [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] ([[Susan Blakeslee]]), Cronos (George Ball), [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], [[Oceanus]], and [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]]. Other characters include [[Hercules]] ([[Kevin Sorbo]]), a demigod and Kratos' half-brother; the architect Daedalus ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), Icarus's father; and Pandora ([[Natalie Lander]]), Hephaestus's artificial daughter. Minor characters include the three Judges of the Underworld: King [[Minos]] ([[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]]), King [[Rhadamanthus]], and King [[Aeacus]]; [[Pirithous|Peirithous]] ([[Simon Templeman]]), an Underworld prisoner in love with Persephone, and Kratos' wife and daughter: Lysandra ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]) and Calliope ([[Debi Derryberry]]), who appear in a plot sequence in which Kratos journeys through his own psyche.<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nKratos, Gaia, and the other Titans{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|Continuing immediately after ''[[God of War II]]''}} ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian gods. Poseidon launches an assault against the Titans, but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood Greece. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.\n\nKratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by Athena's spirit, who had previously sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he briefly mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|Hades at one point mentions the death of Persephone in ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus]]''}} and releases the souls of the Underworld. He considers searching for Calliope's soul, but Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia, where he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.\n[[File:GoW3 Kratos-vs-Cronos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kratos (bottom left) battles enemies on [[Cronus|Cronos]]' arm. The image also depicts the size of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] featured in the game.]]\nKratos continues his ascent, murdering powerful foes that include the Titan Perses and the god Helios; Helios' death plunges Greece into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. Kratos chases Hermes as he arrives at the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is key to the success of his quest. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora herself. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague on Greece. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos, but is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a [[teleportation]] device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the [[Omphalos Stone]] so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims that he was trying to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box.{{refn|name=Timeline3|group=N|events of the [[God of War (2005 video game)|first ''God of War'' game]]}} Reusing the Hyperion Gate, Kratos travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills Hera, ending all Greek plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.\n\nThe imprisoned architect Daedalus tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' reluctance. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks Zeus after Zeus mocks Kratos for his many failures. Gaia, who had survived her apparent demise, returns and tries to kill them both, but they escape through her gaping chest wound and continue their battle next to Gaia's heart. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and starts to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons and powers in the process. Before Zeus can finish him off, Kratos is saved by a vision of Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and his daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. With his resolve restored, he regains consciousness and uses the Blades of Exile to force Zeus' spirit back into his body. Kratos then discards the blades and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.\n\nAs the chains fall from his arms, Athena reappears, demanding that Kratos return what she thinks he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils of the world in the box, she placed the power of hope in it as well, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and slowly corrupted the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, but it had been hidden by his inner guilt. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild what has been destroyed. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for mankind to use. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her. Near death, Kratos collapses, laughing weakly as Athena leaves empty-handed.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a trail of blood leads away from the abandoned Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.{{refn|name=Timeline4|group=N|Kratos' story continues in the [[God of War (2018 video game)|2018 ''God of War'' video game]]}}\n\n==Development==\nIn a 2007 interview with [[GameTrailers]], ''God of War'' creator and game director [[David Jaffe]] explained his original intention for the series, which is different from the actual ending of ''God of War III'', which was based on game director Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's idea was that \"''God of War'' explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths\". He said that it would  have been \"hell on earth\" as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination. Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods, and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the gods\u2014according to Jaffe, the only way a god can truly die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/sdcc-10-gttv-extended/702452|title=SDCC 10: David Jaffe Interview|date=August 2, 2010|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|work=[[GameTrailers]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102122043/http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/mmw93t/gt-tv-sdcc-10--david-jaffe-interview|archivedate=January 2, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> ''God of War III'' was first mentioned by ''God of War II'' game director [[Cory Barlog]] at a ''God of War II'' launch event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164206|title=Cory Barlog Leaving SCEA|last=Leone|first=Matt|date=November 6, 2007|publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]]|work=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|accessdate=January 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102191456/http://www.1up.com/news/cory-barlog-leaving-scea|archivedate=November 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref> Barlog said that the game would have full [[1080p]] HD resolution (changed to [[720p]] in final release<ref name=\"Playstation.Blog - Jeff Rubenstein - Social Media Manager, Sony Computer Entertainment America\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/#comment-314113|title=''God of War III'' Info Drought Ends Now|date=January 18, 2010|last=Rubenstein|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|accessdate=January 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230000355/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/|archivedate=December 30, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>) and support [[Sixaxis]] tilt and vibration functions.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/godofwariii/video/6211094|title=GameSpot Video: ''God of War III'' Stage Demo|last=Pham|first=Bryan|date=June 2, 2009|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 11, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928205331/http://www.gamespot.com/god-of-war-iii/videos/god-of-war-iii-stage-demo-6211094/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> Announced before the [[DualShock 3]] controller was introduced, this caused confusion since the Sixaxis controller does not support rumble.<ref name=\"cooperative mode\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed,-with-rumble--a942-p0.php|title=''God of War 3'' on PS3 confirmed, with rumble?|last=Pinter|first=Justin|date=March 13, 2007|publisher=[[PlayStation Universe]]|accessdate=January 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101925/http://www.psu.com/a942/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed%2C-with-rumble?page=0|archivedate=February 19, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> During the 2009 [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC), the creative team said that the Sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they \"could not find a suitable situation to use Sixaxis in the game effectively\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/|title=Joystiq interview: ''God of War 3'' director Stig Asmussen|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|date=February 13, 2009|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=February 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921063245/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first eight months of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for other opportunities,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-21-god-of-war-director-explains-why-the-entire-game-has-no-camera-cuts|title=God of War director explains why entire game has no camera cuts|date=June 21, 2017|last=Bratt|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=December 27, 2018|quote=I think about if I'd stayed and finished out ''God of War 3''.

Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as one of the reasons for Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal [[texture mapping|mapping]] to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by [[Image Metrics]]'s performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic Simulation]], which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii|title=The Making of God of War III|date=March 27, 2010|last=Leadbetter|first=Richard|publisher=Eurogamer Network|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=January 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210203229/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii|archivedate=February 10, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nThe engine for ''God of War III'' was from the first two installments.

Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components.

Released for the [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3) console on March 16, 2010, the game is the fifth installment in the [[God of War (franchise)|''God of War'' series]], the seventh chronologically, and the sequel to 2007's ''[[God of War II]]''. Loosely based on [[Greek mythology]], the game is set in [[ancient Greece]] with vengeance as its central motif. The [[player character|player controls]] the protagonist and former God of War [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], after his betrayal at the hands of his father [[Zeus]], King of the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]]. Reigniting the [[Titanomachy|Great War]], Kratos ascends [[Mount Olympus]] until he is abandoned by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. Guided by [[Athena]]\u2019s spirit, Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans in a search for [[Pandora]], without whom he cannot open [[Pandora's box|Pandora's Box]], defeat Zeus, and end the reign of the Olympian gods.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on [[combo (video gaming)|combo-based]] combat with the player's main weapon\u2014the Blades of Exile\u2014and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses [[quick time event]]s, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]]. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features [[puzzle video game|puzzles]] and [[platform game|platforming]] elements. Compared with previous installments, ''God of War III'' offers a revamped magic system, more enemies, new camera angles, and [[downloadable content]].\n\n''God of War III'' was critically acclaimed upon release, with a reviewer from [[IGN]] stating that it redefines the word \"scale\" in video games.<ref name=\"IGN-PS3\"/> It has been praised for its graphics, particularly of Kratos, which IGN called \"perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in video games\".<ref name=\"IGN-PS3\"/> The game received several awards, including \"Most Anticipated Game of 2010\" and \"Best PS3 Game\" at the 2009 and 2010 [[Spike Video Game Awards]], respectively, and the \"Artistic Achievement\" award at the 2011 [[7th British Academy Video Games Awards|British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) Video Game Awards. The second best-selling game in the ''God of War'' series and the [[List of best-selling PlayStation 3 video games|ninth best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time]], it sold nearly 5.2&nbsp;million copies worldwide by June 2012 and was included in the ''[[God of War Saga]]'' released for PlayStation 3 on August 28, 2012. In celebration of the ''God of War'' franchise's tenth anniversary, a remastered version of ''God of War III'', titled ''[[#God of War III Remastered|God of War III Remastered]]'', was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] on July 14, 2015.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n\n\n\n{{further|Common gameplay elements in the God of War series}}\n''God of War III'' is an [[action-adventure]] game with [[hack and slash]] elements. It is a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[single-player video game]]. As with previous installments, the player controls the character [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Fixed|fixed-camera]] perspective in [[combo (video gaming)|combo-based combat]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[puzzle video game|puzzle games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/|title=God of War III features 'first-person kills'|date=February 26, 2010|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=April 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112656/http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/26/god-of-war-iii-features-first-person-kills/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref> The enemies are an assortment of [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] creatures, including [[centaur]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], [[chimera (mythology)|chimeras]], [[cyclops|cyclopes]], [[satyr]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s, [[cerberus]]es, and [[Gorgon]]s. The player must also climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and swing on ropes to proceed through the game. The puzzles included vary in difficulty: some puzzles only require objects to be placed in a specific position, while some require timing and precision, such as a puzzle with mechanics similar to ''[[Guitar Hero]]''.<ref name=\"manual\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|pp=6\u20137|ref=manual}}</ref> In addition to finding Gorgon Eyes and [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] Feathers of the previous games, Minotaur Horns are a new item to be found. Where the eyes and feathers increase the player's [[health (gaming)|health]] and [[magic point|magic]] meters, the horns increase the items meter, which allows further use of secondary weapons, called \"Items\".<ref name=\"p10\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=10|ref=manual}}</ref>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:GoW3 Kratos vs Hercules QTE.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot of fight|Kratos (left) battles boss character [[Hercules]] (right). This is an example of a [[quick time event|QTE]] sequence found in all ''God of War'' games; moving the left [[analog stick]] as shown by the orange arrow will allow him to continue his attack.]]\nKratos' main weapon is the Blades of Exile, replacing the Blades of [[Athena]] used in previous installments and the opening moments of the game. The weapon is a pair of blades attached to chains wrapped around the Kratos' wrists and forearms that can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons\u2014the Claws of [[Hades]], the [[Nemean lion|Nemean]] Cestus, and the [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] Whip\u2014with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of [[onyx]].<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nUnlike in previous games, magical abilities are learned with the acquisition of a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired:<ref name=\"manual\"/> the Bow of [[Apollo]], the Head of [[Helios]], and the Boots of [[Hermes]]. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used as a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed.|(2010)|p=5|ref=manual}}</ref>\n\nThe relics [[Poseidon]]'s Trident, the [[Golden Fleece]], and [[Icarus]]' Wings acquired in previous games are retained and used to overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece used to deflect enemy attacks. Hades' Soul allows Kratos to swim in the River [[Styx]]. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in ''[[God of War II]]'', is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nNew additions to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a [[ranged weapon|ranged-grab]] maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away\u2014necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms\u2014and a simple grab allowing him to use a weak foe as a [[battering ram]]. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities like unlimited magic during [[New Game Plus|bonus play]].<ref name=\"p10\"/> The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion.

The events of the game are set between 2007's ''God of War II'' and 2018's ''[[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]]''. The game is set across several locations on [[Mount Olympus]], including the Tomb of [[Ares]], the ancient city of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], the Path of [[Eos]], the [[Labyrinth]], several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and [[Hera]]'s Gardens, and the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] and [[Tartarus]].\n\nThe Tomb of Ares\u2014housing the former God of War's remains\u2014and the city of Olympia lie on the sides of Mount Olympus. Just beyond the city is the Path of Eos, a hidden cavern near the foot of Olympus. The Palace of the Gods is the home of the Olympians, and features the Forum (a small coliseum), Hera's Gardens, and the chambers of Aphrodite and Poseidon. The Labyrinth is a large aerial puzzle constructed by the architect [[Daedalus]] to imprison [[Pandora]] in the Caverns of Olympus, home of [[Scorpius#Mythology|Skorpius]] and its offspring. The Underworld, ruled by [[Hades]] and divided by the River Styx, is the realm of the dead. Hades' palace contains the remains of his wife, [[Persephone]], whom Kratos killed in ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus|Chains of Olympus]]''. The Underworld is also home to statues of the three Judges of the Underworld, who hold the Chain of Balance connecting the Underworld to Olympus. Tartarus is the prison of the dead where the Titan [[Cronus|Cronos]] was banished after Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box from Pandora's Temple in 2005's ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]''.\n\n===Characters===\n{{main|Characters of God of War}}\nKratos (voiced by [[Terrence C. Carson]]), the protagonist of the game, is a Spartan [[demigod]] warrior who became the God of War after killing Ares and seeks revenge on Zeus for his betrayal. Other characters include Greek gods such as Athena ([[Erin Torpey]]), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' mentor and ally; Zeus ([[Corey Burton]]), King of the Gods and the primary antagonist; Poseidon ([[Gideon Emery]]), God of the Sea; Hades ([[Clancy Brown]]), God of the Underworld; [[Hephaestus]] ([[Rip Torn]]), the [[Blacksmith|Smith God]]; Hermes ([[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]), Messenger of the Gods and the God of Speed and Commerce; Helios ([[Crispin Freeman]]), the Sun God; Hera ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]), Queen of the Gods who controls plant life; and Aphrodite ([[April Stewart]]), Goddess of Love and Sexuality. Several Titans are featured, including [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] ([[Susan Blakeslee]]), Cronos (George Ball), [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]], [[Oceanus]], and [[Perses (Titan)|Perses]]. Other characters include [[Hercules]] ([[Kevin Sorbo]]), a demigod and Kratos' half-brother; the architect Daedalus ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), Icarus's father; and Pandora ([[Natalie Lander]]), Hephaestus's artificial daughter. Minor characters include the three Judges of the Underworld: King [[Minos]] ([[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]]), King [[Rhadamanthus]], and King [[Aeacus]]; [[Pirithous|Peirithous]] ([[Simon Templeman]]), an Underworld prisoner in love with Persephone, and Kratos' wife and daughter: Lysandra ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]) and Calliope ([[Debi Derryberry]]), who appear in a plot sequence in which Kratos journeys through his own psyche.<ref name=\"characters\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nKratos, Gaia, and the other Titans{{refn|name=Timeline1|group=N|Continuing immediately after ''[[God of War II]]''}} ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian gods. Poseidon launches an assault against the Titans, but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood Greece. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.\n\nKratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by Athena's spirit, who had previously sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he briefly mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades{{refn|name=Timeline2|group=N|Hades at one point mentions the death of Persephone in ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus]]''}} and releases the souls of the Underworld. He considers searching for Calliope's soul, but Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia, where he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.\n[[File:GoW3 Kratos-vs-Cronos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kratos (bottom left) battles enemies on [[Cronus|Cronos]]' arm. The image also depicts the size of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] featured in the game.]]\nKratos continues his ascent, murdering powerful foes that include the Titan Perses and the god Helios; Helios' death plunges Greece into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. Kratos chases Hermes as he arrives at the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is key to the success of his quest. Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora herself. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague on Greece. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos, but is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a [[teleportation]] device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the [[Omphalos Stone]] so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims that he was trying to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box.{{refn|name=Timeline3|group=N|events of the [[God of War (2005 video game)|first ''God of War'' game]]}} Reusing the Hyperion Gate, Kratos travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills Hera, ending all Greek plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.\n\nThe imprisoned architect Daedalus tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' reluctance. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks Zeus after Zeus mocks Kratos for his many failures. Gaia, who had survived her apparent demise, returns and tries to kill them both, but they escape through her gaping chest wound and continue their battle next to Gaia's heart. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and starts to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons and powers in the process. Before Zeus can finish him off, Kratos is saved by a vision of Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and his daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. With his resolve restored, he regains consciousness and uses the Blades of Exile to force Zeus' spirit back into his body. Kratos then discards the blades and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.\n\nAs the chains fall from his arms, Athena reappears, demanding that Kratos return what she thinks he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils of the world in the box, she placed the power of hope in it as well, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and slowly corrupted the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, but it had been hidden by his inner guilt. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild what has been destroyed. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for mankind to use. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her. Near death, Kratos collapses, laughing weakly as Athena leaves empty-handed.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], a trail of blood leads away from the abandoned Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.{{refn|name=Timeline4|group=N|Kratos' story continues in the [[God of War (2018 video game)|2018 ''God of War'' video game]]}}\n\n==Development==\nIn a 2007 interview with [[GameTrailers]], ''God of War'' creator and game director [[David Jaffe]] explained his original intention for the series, which is different from the actual ending of ''God of War III'', which was based on game director Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's idea was that \"''God of War'' explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths\". He said that it would  have been \"hell on earth\" as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination. Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods, and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the gods\u2014according to Jaffe, the only way a god can truly die.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/sdcc-10-gttv-extended/702452|title=SDCC 10: David Jaffe Interview|date=August 2, 2010|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|work=[[GameTrailers]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102122043/http://www.gametrailers.com/videos/mmw93t/gt-tv-sdcc-10--david-jaffe-interview|archivedate=January 2, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> ''God of War III'' was first mentioned by ''God of War II'' game director [[Cory Barlog]] at a ''God of War II'' launch event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164206|title=Cory Barlog Leaving SCEA|last=Leone|first=Matt|date=November 6, 2007|publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]]|work=[[1UP.com|1UP]]|accessdate=January 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102191456/http://www.1up.com/news/cory-barlog-leaving-scea|archivedate=November 2, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref> Barlog said that the game would have full [[1080p]] HD resolution (changed to [[720p]] in final release<ref name=\"Playstation.Blog - Jeff Rubenstein - Social Media Manager, Sony Computer Entertainment America\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/#comment-314113|title=''God of War III'' Info Drought Ends Now|date=January 18, 2010|last=Rubenstein|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]]|accessdate=January 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230000355/http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/01/18/god-of-war-iii-info-drought-ends-now/|archivedate=December 30, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>) and support [[Sixaxis]] tilt and vibration functions.<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/action/godofwariii/video/6211094|title=GameSpot Video: ''God of War III'' Stage Demo|last=Pham|first=Bryan|date=June 2, 2009|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=September 11, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928205331/http://www.gamespot.com/god-of-war-iii/videos/god-of-war-iii-stage-demo-6211094/|archivedate=September 28, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> Announced before the [[DualShock 3]] controller was introduced, this caused confusion since the Sixaxis controller does not support rumble.<ref name=\"cooperative mode\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.com/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed,-with-rumble--a942-p0.php|title=''God of War 3'' on PS3 confirmed, with rumble?|last=Pinter|first=Justin|date=March 13, 2007|publisher=[[PlayStation Universe]]|accessdate=January 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101925/http://www.psu.com/a942/God-of-War-3-on-PS3-confirmed%2C-with-rumble?page=0|archivedate=February 19, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref> During the 2009 [[Game Developers Conference]] (GDC), the creative team said that the Sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they \"could not find a suitable situation to use Sixaxis in the game effectively\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/|title=Joystiq interview: ''God of War 3'' director Stig Asmussen|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|date=February 13, 2009|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=February 20, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921063245/http://www.joystiq.com/2009/02/13/joystiq-interview-god-of-war-3s-stig-asmussen-game-director/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nAfter the first eight months of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for other opportunities,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-21-god-of-war-director-explains-why-the-entire-game-has-no-camera-cuts|title=God of War director explains why entire game has no camera cuts|date=June 21, 2017|last=Bratt|first=Chris|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=December 27, 2018|quote=I think about if I'd stayed and finished out ''God of War 3''.

Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as one of the reasons for Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal [[texture mapping|mapping]] to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by [[Image Metrics]]'s performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as [[Dynamic simulation|Dynamic Simulation]], which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii|title=The Making of God of War III|date=March 27, 2010|last=Leadbetter|first=Richard|publisher=Eurogamer Network|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=January 27, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210203229/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-making-of-god-of-war-iii|archivedate=February 10, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy}}</ref>\n\nThe engine for ''God of War III'' was from the first two installments.

Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content.

best attributes into a stellar experience.\"<ref name=\"X-Play\"/> IGN's Chris Roper said that ''God of War III'' \"practically redefines\" scale in video games, singling out the size of the Titans as being \"larger than entire levels in other games\".<ref name=\"IGN-PS3\"/> Mike Jackson of ''[[PlayStation Official Magazine - UK|Official PlayStation Magazine UK]]'' called it the biggest ''God of War'' game yet; if it was the series' last game, \"''God of War III'' gives PlayStation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves.\"<ref name=\"OPMUK\"/>\n\nMatt Leone of [[1UP.com|1UP]] said that the gameplay has \"variety&nbsp;... You seemingly see, acquire, and participate in something new around every corner\". According to Leone, each weapon \"adds a lot of depth to the combat system.\"<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Christian Donlan of ''Eurogamer'' said that the \"combat system, level flow, and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched. But everything's bigger, grander and more elaborate.\" He praised the weapons' accessibility, saying that it is easy to quickly switch between them.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> According to Tom McShea of [[GameSpot]], the combat and scale \"have been pushed further than ever before&nbsp;... creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down, and even harder to forget.\" McShea said that regardless of repetition, \"the brutality of combat is one of the most satisfying aspects of ''God of War III''.\"<ref name=\"GSpot-PS3\"/> Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' called ''God of War III'' \"visceral\" and \"brutal\", and Kratos \"the undisputed king of the genre.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer-PS3\"/> Jackson, however, said the core gameplay's familiarity \"makes it feel less than the very, very best\",<ref name=\"OPMUK\"/> and according to Roper, two of the three additional weapons are similar to the main blades; they \"have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large they're more of the same.\"<ref name=\"IGN-PS3\"/>\n\nIts plot received mixed reviews.

The song was [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and has sold 592,000 copies in the United States as of April 2016.

The narrator discusses the differences in appearance and character of the boy she knew, as opposed to the man who grew mature enough to marry.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

He traveled to the United States in 1848 with his wife, living first in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and later in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. \n\nHe visited [[Virginia]] in 1854 and stayed until about 1856 or 1857 sketching and painting a number of scenes that would appear in his \"Album of Virginia\" (1857).<ref>[https://www.roanoke.com/calendar/arts/a-look-back-at-edward-beyer-artist/event_dcfc13d0-d66f-11e6-8342-5cb9017beffb.html A Look Back at Edward Beyer, Artist], ''The Roanoke Times'', January 16, 2017</ref><ref>Beyer, Edward.

Fesko said she was amazed when she saw the piece and had to pull out her glasses to fully examine in detail the panoramic work. While in Charleston, Beyer was offered a commission from a number of businessmen in the community. They had to have a lottery to decide who would own the painting, and it stayed with the same family ever since. Fesko said that Beyer created 40 panoramic landscape paintings of Virginia towns in the mid-19th century.<ref>Patrick, Anna. [http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20140816/gz01/140819366/1419 \"W.

He traveled to the United States in 1848 with his wife, living first in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and later in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. \n\nHe visited [[Virginia]] in 1854 and stayed until about 1856 or 1857 sketching and painting a number of scenes that would appear in his \"Album of Virginia\" (1857).<ref>[https://www.roanoke.com/calendar/arts/a-look-back-at-edward-beyer-artist/event_dcfc13d0-d66f-11e6-8342-5cb9017beffb.html A Look Back at Edward Beyer, Artist], ''The Roanoke Times'', January 16, 2017</ref><ref>Beyer, Edward.

Fesko said she was amazed when she saw the piece and had to pull out her glasses to fully examine in detail the panoramic work. While in Charleston, Beyer was offered a commission from a number of businessmen in the community. They had to have a lottery to decide who would own the painting, and it stayed with the same family ever since. Fesko said that Beyer created 40 panoramic landscape paintings of Virginia towns in the mid-19th century.<ref>Patrick, Anna. [http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20140816/gz01/140819366/1419 \"W.
