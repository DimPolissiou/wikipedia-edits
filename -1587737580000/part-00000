DSU is one of eight publicly funded universities in the state.\n\n==History==\nThe school was established in 1924 by the State of Mississippi, using the facilities of the former Bolivar County Agricultural High School, which consisted of three buildings in Cleveland. On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor [[Henry L. Whitfield]] signed on April 9, 1924;<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=11}}</ref> the bill had been sponsored in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] by [[Nellie Nugent Somerville]], the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/legislators/Mississippi.html|title=Women Wielding Power-Mississippi|work=nwhm.org|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nOn February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class.<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=40}}</ref>\n\nWorld War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the [[GI Bill]] to encourage education.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |title=Timeline 2 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |archive-date=2012-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1947 session of the Delta Council, [[Dean Acheson]] (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the [[Marshall Plan]].

Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen.\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of [[okra]] wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/23/Columns/In_nickname_realm__Fi.shtml|title=Columns: In nickname realm, Fighting Okra snappiest|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Good Eats]]''.<ref>[http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1073.asp?item=1827 \"Delta State's Okra mascot to appear on Food Network's ''Good Eats''\"]</ref>\n\nThe popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games.\n\n==Academics==\nDelta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors.

DSU is one of eight publicly funded universities in the state.\n\n==History==\nThe school was established in 1924 by the State of Mississippi, using the facilities of the former Bolivar County Agricultural High School, which consisted of three buildings in Cleveland. On February 19, 1924, Senators William B. Roberts and Arthur Marshall cosponsored Senate Bill No. 236, which established Delta State Teachers College, which Mississippi Governor [[Henry L. Whitfield]] signed on April 9, 1924;<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=11}}</ref> the bill had been sponsored in the [[Mississippi House of Representatives]] by [[Nellie Nugent Somerville]], the first woman to serve in the Mississippi state legislature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/legislators/Mississippi.html|title=Women Wielding Power-Mississippi|work=nwhm.org|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> The three buildings were Hill Hall, an administration and classroom building, Hardee Hall, a men's dormitory, and Taylor Hall, a women's dormitory.\n\nOn February 14, 1924, James Wesley Broom was appointed president of the college, and the college opened its doors on September 15, 1925. In May 1926, Broom died following complications from an ear infection. William Zeigel was named his successor. The seal of the college was designed in 1928 as a project of an art class.<ref>{{harvp|Gunn|Castle|1980|p=40}}</ref>\n\nWorld War II greatly affected the college. Anticipating the war in 1941, the college created a civilian pilot training program. When the war began, 254 Delta State students joined the armed forces. When the war ended, student enrollment at Delta State increased from 185 to 483, aided by the federal program for veterans known as the [[GI Bill]] to encourage education.<ref name=\"deltastate.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |title=Timeline 2 |publisher=Deltastate.edu |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207204348/http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1228.asp |archive-date=2012-02-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1947 session of the Delta Council, [[Dean Acheson]] (Under-Secretary of State in Truman's administration) delivered a speech on campus that unveiled the [[Marshall Plan]].

Shirley Antoinette Washington was the first African-American student to enroll at DSU that year.<ref name=\"deltastate1\"/>\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the university developed an aviation program, which continues.\n\nIn 2005 Delta State assisted evacuees from [[Hurricane Katrina]] by opening Hugh White Hall as temporary housing.\n\n===Presidents===\n* James Wesley Broom \u2013 1925\u20131926\n* Dr. William Marion Kethley \u2013 1926\u20131956\n* Dr. James Milton Ewing \u2013 1956\u20131971\n* [[Aubrey K.

Particularly famous facilities at Delta State University are the large natatorium for holding swimming competitions, the Bologna Performing Arts Center (pictured left) with two theaters (one that seats 1,178, and another that seats 135), and the sound recording studios of the Delta Music Institute.\n\n==Mascots==\nDelta State has two mascots (one official, one unofficial). Since its inception, Delta State's sports teams have officially been known as the Statesmen because of the role State Rep. Walter Sillers, Jr. played in the location of the school in Cleveland. Sillers was speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives for 20 years. The female teams are called the Lady Statesmen.\n\nHowever, since the late 1980s, the student body has embraced a mascot that depicts a piece of [[okra]] wearing boxing gloves and brandishing a fierce expression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/23/Columns/In_nickname_realm__Fi.shtml|title=Columns: In nickname realm, Fighting Okra snappiest|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> The \"Fighting Okra\" grew out of humor among students about the improbability that anyone would find a \"Statesman\" particularly frightening. In the mid-1990s, a student vote was taken, resulting in the university taking on \"The Fighting Okra\" as an unofficial mascot. The \"Fighting Okra\" was featured in the \"Okraphobia\" episode of the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Good Eats]]''.<ref>[http://www.deltastate.edu/pages/1073.asp?item=1827 \"Delta State's Okra mascot to appear on Food Network's ''Good Eats''\"]</ref>\n\nThe popularity of \"The Fighting Okra\" grew so much that many myths started on how the mascot came to be, the most popular of these stating there was a stubborn okra plant at first base on the baseball field that grew back every time it was cut. The true origin of the fighting okra mascot was a discussion between basketball and baseball players in the \"Court of Governors\" dormitory. The Statesman mascot was temporarily prohibited from participating in athletic activities after a physical altercation with the Mississippi College's Choctaw mascot at a basketball game. Basketball player Houston Williamson was lamenting the fact that \"Fighting Statesmen\" was not particularly frightening to their opponents. All present agreed that an alternative mascot would have to be mean and green. After a lively discussion and many suggestions, baseball pitcher Bob Black suggested that okra was green, fuzzy, and tough. The DSU baseball team began using the chant \"Okra! Okra! Okra! Okra!\" at DSU basketball games.\n\n==Academics==\nDelta State provides an undergraduate curriculum, offering 12 baccalaureate degrees in 42 majors.

President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Mascot===\nIt wasn't until 1920 that the UCA athletic teams had a mascot. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920 the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, it wasn\u2019t until April 7, 1921, that the teams were called the \"Bears\" in print. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas\u2019 nickname was the \"Bear State\". The women's teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Main Hall===\nUCA's Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas.

On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110204.htm |title=WEEKLY LIST OF ACTIONS TAKEN ON PROPERTIES |date=February 4, 2011 |website=National Park Service |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===World War II Marker===\nUCA's World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003.

The purpose of The Arkansas State Normal School was to properly train students to become professional teachers and centralize teacher training. Classes began September 21, 1908 with nine academic departments, one building on {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, 107 students and seven faculty members. Two faculty members taught in two departments and President Doyne taught pedagogy and Latin.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn 1925, Arkansas State Normal School became '''Arkansas State Teachers College'''.<ref name=\"history\" /> The name change more accurately reflected the primary focus of instruction and mission of the institution.\n[[Image:GardensUCA.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Flowers looking towards the south, central part of campus.]]\nBy 1967, the mission of Arkansas State Teachers College had changed. Though teacher training was still an important part of the school's mission, other fields began to expand in liberal arts studies and in the emerging field of health care. To recognize the institution's existing academic diversity another name change was in order. In January 1967, Arkansas State Teachers College became the '''State College of Arkansas'''.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nPresident Silas Snow, who championed the name change in 1967, organized State College of Arkansas along university lines in preparation for still yet another name change. State College of Arkansas grew rapidly and offered an ever-widening range of degree programs. By January 1975, Snow\u2019s efforts were realized as the State Department of Higher Education recommended State College of Arkansas be known as The University of Central Arkansas, or UCA.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Presidents===\n[[File:TorrLib.jpg|thumb|Torreyson Library, named after Burr Walter Torreyson.]]\n\n* John James Doyne (1908\u20131917)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Burr Walter Torreyson (1917\u20131930)<ref name=\"history\" />\n* Heber L.

President Doyne assigned the task of developing school colors to W.O. Wilson and Ida Waldran in 1908. Wilson was wearing a gray sweater and Waldran was wearing a purple scarf. They chose the colors based upon the color of the clothing they were wearing that day. Both Wilson and Waldran thought that purple and gray complemented each other. Today the official colors for all UCA sports teams are purple and gray.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Mascot===\nIt wasn't until 1920 that the UCA athletic teams had a mascot. According to Dr. Ted Worley, author of A History of The Arkansas State Teachers College, the UCA teams from 1908 to 1919 were referred to by many names, including: Tutors, Teachers, Pedagogues, Pea-Pickers, and Normalites. In 1920 the Bears became the mascot for the teams. However, it wasn\u2019t until April 7, 1921, that the teams were called the \"Bears\" in print. Dr. Worley also quoted sources as saying the Bear was an appropriate symbol for the school because Arkansas\u2019 nickname was the \"Bear State\". The women's teams were known as the Bearettes for several years. The name of Sugar Bear came later. Victor E. Bear came about in 1999 and Victoria E. Bear came soon after. Bruce D. Bear became the newest addition to the UCA family in 2006.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Main Hall===\nUCA's Main Hall is the oldest building on campus. This building was completed in 1919 and was built by George Donaghey, the man for whom Donaghey Avenue is named and a former governor of the State of Arkansas. After the building was built it served a dual role as the administration building and as a classroom building. It continued to serve as the administration building until the 1960s. On February 11, 2011, the building was named on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110204.htm |title=WEEKLY LIST OF ACTIONS TAKEN ON PROPERTIES |date=February 4, 2011 |website=National Park Service |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===World War II Marker===\nUCA's World War II Memorial was dedicated in October 2003.

There were also concerns over soldiers seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had joined the army in the hope of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} The Legion came as a solution for those who would not conform to the governing agenda: a way for the French State to contend the most restless soldiers and keep them at sight.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the soldiers during the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}. The Algerian war was very unpopular. [[Louis Philipe I]] was a pacifist and did not want to risk being seen as going against public opinion, nor did he wish to upset his military commandment by being seen to endanger French lives. Hence the idea of using foreign troops, recruited for this specific purpose and organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831. The ordinance had nine articles.\n{{verse translation|lang=fr|Louis-Philippe, roi des Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 tous pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir salut ;\n\nVu la loi du 9 mars 1831 :\n\nSur le rapport de notre Ministre Secr\u00e9taire d\u2019\u00c9tat au D\u00e9partement de la Guerre : Nous avons ordonn\u00e9 et ordonnons ce qui suit :\n\nArt. 1 - Il sera form\u00e9 une L\u00e9gion compos\u00e9e d\u2019\u00c9trangers.

To the State, the Legion succeeded in diminishing the number of foreign exiled politicians and potential revolutionaries. It attracted both French and foreign nationals from all walks of life.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=38}} Certain persons enlisted from a nonetheless motivated allure and voluntary spirit, the times helping and Africa still unknown, so adventurers also enlisted.{{sfn|Blond|1981}} Also, many friends from France, who were numerous, hoped to battle for the nation. Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times. Foreign officers who had left their armies were not familiar with the [[French language]], and hailed from different armies or other branches of the military. Punishments were numerous and harsh with insubordination and desertion being common. In mid-May, the National Guard was called upon to prevent a possible rebellion. On that day, 20 soldiers were arrested.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=44}}\n\nDespite these complications, less than six months after the royal ordinance,{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984|p=10}} five battalions were created, each with eight combat companies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" align='center'\n|+ Nationalities by battalion \n! !! nationalities\n|-\n| 1st || Swiss and former of Hohenlohe\n|-\n| 2nd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 3rd || Swiss and Germans \n|-\n| 4th || Spanish\n|-\n| 5th || Sardinians and Italians\n|-\n| 6th || Belgians and Dutch \n|}\n\n=== The beginnings ===\nStarting the month of August, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th battalions deployed to Algeria, counting a total of 78 Officers and 2,669 [[Non-commissioned officer|Sous-officiers]] and Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon1999|p=15}}\n\nThe Legion was first preoccupied with [[Fortification|earthworks]] and accordingly gained their reputation as a {{ill|builder soldiers|fr|soldat b\u00e2tisseur}}, the essential base of the Legion. Accordingly, the Legion would build the route of Casbah in the region of Algiers, that of the {{ill|Emperor's Fort|fr|Fort de l'Empereur}}, or that of the belt of Algiers. The Legion also participated in the construction of many [[Forts]], including the Water Fort. During the construction of the works fevers, [[dysentery]] and [[cholera]] would kill or reform 3,200 men between 1831 and 1835.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=50}}\n\n=== Baptism by fire ===\nApril 27, 1832, 300 men of the 3rd battalion began to secure the surrounding of Algiers and engaged in combat at Maison Carr\u00e9. On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

A [[Germanic Legion]], an {{ill|Italian Legion|fr|L\u00e9gion Italique}}, a [[Batavian Legion]], and a [[Polish Legions (Napoleonic period)|Polish Legion]] were also formed.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=12}}.

There were also concerns over soldiers seen as foreign insurrectionists and volunteer fighters which had joined the army in the hope of continuing the [[French Revolution|1789 Revolution]].{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=37}} The Legion came as a solution for those who would not conform to the governing agenda: a way for the French State to contend the most restless soldiers and keep them at sight.{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=34}}\n\nIn addition, despite the [[enthusiasm]] showcased by the soldiers during the [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830]], morale was at a low{{sfn|Blond|1981|p=25}}. The Algerian war was very unpopular. [[Louis Philipe I]] was a pacifist and did not want to risk being seen as going against public opinion, nor did he wish to upset his military commandment by being seen to endanger French lives. Hence the idea of using foreign troops, recruited for this specific purpose and organised in a dedicated corps: the French Foreign Legion. \n\n=== Creation by Royal Ordinance ===\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Royal Ordinance on March 9, 1831.

Nevertheless, this created a motley corps, where soldiers rubbed elbows with anarchists. Inactivity in wait for assignments and [[nationalism]] of some, entailed high energies between communities, which entailed the need to have a more concise common frame.\n\nOfficers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s were needed;{{sfn|Porch|1994|p=39}} but those of the Imperial Army were too old already and unequal to the times.

On May 23, a detachment was exterminated: resulting in 26 fatalities.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=16}} The conquest of Algeria cost the French Foreign Legion: 27 Officers, 61 Sous-officiers and 756 Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=19}} Colonel Combes, arrived from [[Marseille]] with the first flag of the Legion offered by [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the name of the [[List of French monarchs|King]].\n\nInscribed on the flag was: ''Le Roi des Fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re'' (\"King of the French in the French Foreign Legion\"). The troop was then known and distinguished.{{sfn|Messager|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThe Legion fought at Sidi Chabal in November 1832, where the Spanish battalion distinguished itself. In March 1833, Legionnaires fought at Ouled Yacoub and Oule Attia, against [[Emir]] [[Emir Abdelkader|Abdelkader]] and the tribes of the [[Sig, Algeria|Sig]].\n\nThe Legion won a victory at [[Arzew]] on June 5 and took [[Mostaganem]] on July 27, 1833.\n\n1835 was marked by fighting at [[Battle of Macta|Moulay Ismael]] and cost the lives of a hundred Legionnaires.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=18}}\n\n== Spain and the end of the old Legion ==\n=== Goodwill to Spain ===\n{{See also|Carlism|First Carlist War}}\nOn June 28, 1843, the ambassadors of London, Lisbon, and Paris signed a treaty with Spain supporting Marie-Christina. France did not favour this treaty, because it did not want to interfere in Spanish affairs or risk compromising European peace,{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}} and so did not want to send the regular French Army. Sending the Foreign Legion allowed France to justify involvement.\n\nOn January 28, 1835, under pressure from [[Adolphe Thiers]], Minister of Interior, the Legion was ceded to the Queen of Spain. On June 29, a royal ordinance stipulated that the French Foreign Legion was no longer part of the French Army.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=20}} The [[Army Corps]] had been ceded to Spain, and all Legionnaires embarked: the sick, imprisoned, and those on leave included. The men could not back out or they would face severe sanctions for insubordination.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=21}}\n\nOn July 30, 123 officers and 4,021 [[Non-commissioned officers|Sous-Officiers]] and Legionnaires embarked on [[French Navy|La Royal]]<ref>This was the traditional surname of the [[French Navy|French War Navy]].</ref> heading to Algeria.\n\nDuring a stopover at the [[Balearic Islands]], the battalions were reorganized, and all nationalities mixed together.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=22}}\n\n=== The fighting ===\nThe Legion in Spain became the French Auxiliary Division and their chief, colonel Bernelle, became [[Mar\u00e9chal de camp]] of the Spanish Armies. On arrival, the Legion entered the war against 5,000 Carlists in Catalonia. After several skirmishes in Navarre and Aragon, the Legion entered [[Pamplona]] on February 5, 1836 to encircle and isolate the province.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\nThe Legion often fought alone becoming more autonomous;{{sfn|Young|Bergot|1984}} Bernelle supplemented his troops with three squadrons of lancers, a [[Howitzer]] battery for support, and a [[Company (military unit)|medical]] company. This was the beginning of the modern French Foreign Legion.\n\nDay after day, the Legion lost men. On April 15, 1836, losses had risen to 117 killed, 380 dead of wounds or disease, and 83 deserters.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999}} At Tirapequi on April 26, 500 Legionnaires repelled 3,500 Carlists at the cost of 90 dead{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} and, on August 1, at [[Zubiri, Navarre|Zubiri]], the Legion all alone killed 1,200 Carlists in one battle.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}}\n\n=== The Legion abandoned ===\nIn Spain, the Legion became more and more isolated with reinforcements arriving sporadically.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=24}} Paris turned a deaf ear, equipment and supplies were insufficient, the pay was irregular, and decorations and advancement did not follow. [[Adolphe Thiers]], president of the council, refused them aid, saying that the Legion had been handed in full and entirely to Spain. Reaching a limit, Bernelle resigned and returned to France. The King didn't want to send reinforcements from the [[French Army|regular army]], out of fear of tiring the troops and becoming entrenched. In addition, the conquest of Algeria required reinforcements. The King did not want to divide his troops. The Legion was accordingly left to its fate.\n\n=== Misery and wandering ===\nThe Legion continued to fight, the lack of decent equipment aggravated by the particularly bitter winter of 1836\u20131837 in the plains of [[Aragon]]. With their pay in default and their living conditions poor, some joined the Carlists who were living off the land.\n\nAt the beginning of 1837, the Legion had only three battalions, then two; the Legion had been reduced in half since its arrival. However, the Legion continued to fight with a suicidal determination.{{sfn|Poirmeur|1931|p=26}}\n\nIn 1838, the Legion was a shadow of itself in poor living conditions, without resources, and surrounded by Carlists. It was not until December 8 that the Queen finally granted its dissolution. They left Zaragoza on January 2, 1839, and crossed the Pyrenees, starved and miserable. \n \nSome 6,000 had disembarked at Tarragona in 1835, but only 63 Officers and 50 troops returned.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=26}} During the Spanish odyssey, the King had created [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|another Legion]].\n\n== The new Legion ==\n=== Second Legion ===\n[[File:Marie Alphonse Bedeau (1804 \u2013 1863).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Marie Alphonse Bedeau.]]\n\nThe departure of the Legion to the Spanish Army in 1835 left a void. Foreigners remained numerous in France, which also needed as many men as possible in Africa and Spain. Accordingly, a [[2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)|New Legion]] formed in December 1835,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} with a garrison in Paris of one battalion. On March 22, two general staff headquarters companies were formed, and as of June 26, the battalion was complete. The government, tired of the Spanish adventure, licensed a battalion on August 11, 1836, and sent the Legion to Spain.{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} These were the last reinforcements for the Legionnaires in Spain.\n\nThe government again began to form a Legion in November 1836. On November 21, a new battalion was constituted at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]]. With 1,200 men, it embarked at [[Toulon]] on the ''[[French Navy|Suffren]]'' on December 11,{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=16}} and arrived four days later in Algiers.\n\nRecruitment continued in France, and on September 4, 1837, a second battalion was constituted by royal decree. The two battalions together were the equivalent of a regular infantry regiment.\n\nStarting from Algiers, 1837 was for the French Foreign Legion of Africa a succession of battles ending in the peace accord signed between France and the resistance led by [[Emir Abdelkader]], recognizing in the [[Treaty of Tafna]] the sovereignty of France in certain Algerian regions. Despite the treaty, the peace was relative. The Legion undertook harsh expeditions{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=17}} in the valley of Isser to reduce rebel activity whose troublesome activities reached as far as [[Boufarik]].\n\n=== Battle of Constantine ===\n[[File:La prise de Constantine 1837 par Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Constantine]], by [[Horace Vernet]]]]\n\nThe relatively calm situation allowed the elaboration of grand manoeuvres. [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] was the subject of focus. All available troops marched towards Constantine, a stronghold on rocks overlooking the Rhummel, considered invulnerable.\n\nSince the unsuccessful expedition of [[Bertrand Clauzel]] which cost him his position, the fall of the [[Citadel]] was crucial. Battle formations constituted one [[Marching Regiment|Marching]] Legion Battalion, 500 men strong under the orders of a [[Ranks in the French Army|chef de bataillon]] ([[Ranks in the French Army|Commandant-Major]]) [[Marie Alphonse Bedeau]].{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=30}}\n\nThe expedition arrived in [[Constantine (Algeria)|Constantine]] on October 6, 1837, and General [[Charles-Marie Denys de Damr\u00e9mont]], governor of Algiers, began the siege. The expedition was divided into four brigades; the Legion was part of the third brigade. The [[artillery]] of g\u00e9n\u00e9ral [[Sylvain Charles Val\u00e9e]] breached the fortress. On October 13, the men launched an assault. The Legionnaires under Colonel Combes, their former chief, engaged in close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, clearing the most important arenas.{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|pp=30\u201331}} After three dreadful hours of fighting, the Legion and the other brigades managed to take Constantine during the night.\n\nBedeau was designated \"Commandant du Lieu\" and promoted to [[Ranks in the French Army|Lieutenant-colonel]].\n\n=== Posterity ===\nThe conquest of Algeria resulted in another twenty years of mobilization. Following Constantine, the Legion regrouped in Algiers in 1838, numbering 2,823 men{{sfn|Messager|2007|p=18}} on November 10, 1838. It continued to fight, distinguishing itself at Djidjelli, Medea and Miliana, often victorious at the cost of heavy losses.\n\nThe Legion definitely garrisoned in Algeria and France in 1840. First, owing to the return of the survivors of Spain, and their 10,000 enemies{{sfn|Montagnon|1999|p=27}} which had left their country after the failure of the Carlist revolution. The structural reform which, by the intermediary royal ordinance of December 30, 1840, doubled the Legion in two Foreign Regiments. The [[1st Foreign Regiment]], directed by colonel Mollenbeck, was formed in Algiers on April 1, 1841. Similarly, the [[2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], directed by colonel {{ill|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Cari\u00e9s de Senilhes|fr}} was constituted at [[Annaba|B\u00f4ne]] on April 21, 1841. The Legion first garrisoned at [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]] in 1843 and left 119 years later in 1962.\n\nIn addition to Algeria, the Legion saw other action overseas to advance French colonial interests and completed successful campaigns in Indochina, Madagascar, Morocco, and other territories that eventually became part of the French empire. According to Blanchard, the Legion became part of the colonization \"in the professed name of civilization and racial superiority, at a time of rising nationalism and... rivalries between European powers.\"<ref>Blanchard.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Major (France)]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Pioneers (Pionniers)]]\n*[[List of French Foreign Legion units]]\n*[[History of the 2nd Foreign Regiment]]\n*[[Foreign Legion Command]] \n*[[Marie Louis Henry de Granet-Lacroix de Chabri\u00e8res]]\n*[[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Certain Canrobert]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Achille Bazaine]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion Music Band (MLE)]]\n*[[Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Douglas |last=Porch |title=La L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1962 |language=fr |trans-title=The French Foreign Legion 1831-1962 |publisher=Fayard |date=1994 |isbn=978-2213031118 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first=Pierre |last=Montagnon |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion de 1831 \u00e0 nos jours |language=fr |trans-title=History of the Legion from 1831 till present |publisher=Pygmalion |date=1999 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Poirmeur |title=Notre vieille L\u00e9gion |language=fr |trans-title=Our Old Legion |publisher=Berger-Levraut |place=Paris |date=1931 |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book |first=George |last=Blond |title=Histoire de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re 1831-1981 |language=fr |trans-title=History of the French Foreign Legion 1831-1981 |publisher=Club France Loisir |orig-year=1st pub.

His parents offered him the opportunity to study in the best schools, where he learned French and German. After high school, he initially studied at a college in [[Voronezh]], later enrolling in the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law]] to study jurisprudence.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> \n\n=== Political activism and imprisonment ===\nIn 1904 he left the university, joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] and became involved in the revolutionary labor movement. He was engaged in cultural and educational activity among the workers of the city when he met [[Father Gapon]] and joined his petition movement; on [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]] he was with a group that was turned back by soldiers before it could reach the [[Winter Palace]].  During the ensuing strikes he took the lead in creating the first [[St. Petersburg Soviet]] in order to coordinate aid and information for the workers; although quiescent much of the year and finally suppressed in December after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the Soviet was revived during the [[February Revolution]] of 1917.\n\nHe was arrested, imprisoned and deported because of his revolutionary activities after the 1905 Revolution. In 1907 he escaped from prison fled fled to [[Third French Republic|France]]. He settled in [[Paris]] where he completed his studies, came under the influence of Russian [[anarchist]]s and joined the movement, a small group of [[Apollon Karelin]], in 1911.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> Volin's views eventually gravitated towards anarcho-syndicalism, and he decided to leave the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1913.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> During the first months of the [[First World War]] he participated in the [[Opposition to World War I|International Commission for the Anti-militarist Section]], for which he was detained by the French authorities in 1915. At this point he was married and had four children. He remained in a [[Internment camps in France#World War I and later|concentration camp]] from where he was to be deported, but he escaped with the help of some French comrades and embarked from [[Bordeaux]] to the [[United States]]. \n\nIn America, Volin joined the [[Union of Russian Workers]], which had more than 10,000 members. In the union he was very well received, he was placed in charge of editing its paper, ''[[Golos Truda]]'' (''Voice of the Labor)'', and he was regularly required to attend conferences throughout North America, since it lacked speakers and propagandists. He was a great orator, as the Russian press had pointed out during the events of 1905. His easy speech, the persuasive tone of his voice, the elegance of his imaginative and colorful language, the vigor and the elevation of his thought, attracted the adherence of the masses, who gathered to listen to him.\n\n=== After the Revolution ===\nBut in 1917 he abandoned his work in America to return to [[Petrograd]], in the midst of the [[Russian Revolution]]. Back in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], he verified the weakness of the anarchist movement, due to the little consideration that anarchists in Russia paid to the organization in North America. He tried to solve the disunity of anarchists living in Russia and anarchists who went into exile in the times of the Tsar, but forming the ''Petrograd Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda''. This decided to continue the publication of the Golos Truda, of which Volin continued as editor. After the [[October revolution]], the newspaper was made daily and a Bolshevik-oriented editorial committee was added to it. This committee was not to the liking of Volin, who left the newspaper after the signing of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]].\n\nHe left for [[Bobrov, Bobrovsky District, Voronezh Oblast|Bobrov]], where he worked in the city [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] and was reunited with his wife and four children, back from France. He was in charge of popular education, with the task of bringing the population to an understanding of revolutionary events. Shortly thereafter, he joined the organizers of the Kursk Conference, which commissioned him to draft adopted resolutions and prepare a statement that could be accepted by all the trends and nuances of anarchism - allowing everyone to work in a single organization. Thus, Volin formulated his idea of [[Synthesis anarchism]], which included [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]] and [[Anarcho-individualism|individualism]], since he considered these to be the three main aspects of anarchism.\n\nIn the autumn of 1918, Volin created, together with other colleagues, the [[Nabat]], an organization that had a great capacity for mobilization due to its high number of affiliates.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/>\n\n===The Ukrainian Revolution and the Bolshevik repression===\nIn 1919, Volin decided to join the Makhnovist movement, in the culture and education sector, to organize meetings, conferences, talks, popular councils, as well as the publication of flyers and posters. That same year, Volin was elected president of the Insurgent Council, where he worked intensively for six months.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://libcom.org/library/preface-volin|title=History of the Makhnovist movement, 1918-1921|first=Peter|last=Arshinov|chapter=Preface by Volin}}</ref> His work was interrupted when he fell ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Due to his immobility, he was easily arrested on January 14, 1920 and transferred to [[Moscow]] at the hands of the [[Cheka]]. He was released in October 1920, on the occasion of the alliance signed between the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and the [[Red Army]] to fight [[Pyotr Wrangel]]'s forces.\n\nHe moved to [[Kharkiv]], where, with the Nabat Confederation, he prepared an anarchist Congress for December 25. On the eve of the congress, the Bolsheviks arrested Volin and the anarchists in attendance, for their membership in libertarian groups. Volin and the other prisoners were transferred to Moscow.\n\nFrom then on he was incarcerated in [[Butyrka prison]] In prison, everyone knew about the Cheka's brutality, against which they protested with a [[hunger strike]] that lasted for ten and a half days, and ended thanks to an unexpected intervention: convinced by [[Emma Goldman]], [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Alexander Shapiro]], the European delegates to a [[Profintern]] Congress obtained the release of ten prisoners, including Volin, on condition of perpetual banishment under threat of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oaca.iespana.es/oaca/biografiasanarquistas.htm|title=Brief biographies of some Anarchists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218185636/http://oaca.iespana.es/oaca/biografiasanarquistas.htm|archivedate=December 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Russian Anarchists| first=Paul|last=Avrich|editorial=Alianza Editorial, 1974, (p.237)</ref>\n\nAdmitted to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] despite lack of proper documents, he and his family lived in [[Berlin]], where he wrote (in German) an 80-page pamphlet called ''The Persecution of the Anarchists in Soviet Russia'', translated [[Peter Arshinov]]'s ''History of the Makhnovist Movement'' and wrote a long biographical preface for it. Together with Arshinov, he founded a magazine called ''The Anarchist Herald'' and along with other Russian exiles, they formed several committees to help theire comrades imprisoned by the Bolshevik regime. After two years, Volin received an invitation from [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] to help him prepare the ''Encyclop\u00e9die Anarchiste'', so he moved to [[Paris]], where he wrote for the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' and other publications.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/>\n\nVolin participated in the publication of [[Dielo Truda]] (Causa Obrera), as part of the \"Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad\". However, following the publication of the controversial [[Platformism|Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]] in 1926, Volin broke with Nestor Makhno and Peter Arshinov. The bitter dispute marked a deep divide within the Russian anarchist movement in exile. In 1927 Volin founded the ''Association des F\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes Anarchistes'', a synthesist organization, and after several rearrangements of the French anarchist organizations, in 1934 he joined the editorial staff of ''Terre Libre''.

His parents offered him the opportunity to study in the best schools, where he learned French and German. After high school, he initially studied at a college in [[Voronezh]], later enrolling in the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law]] to study jurisprudence.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> \n\n=== Political activism and imprisonment ===\nIn 1904 he left the university, joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] and became involved in the revolutionary labor movement. He was engaged in cultural and educational activity among the workers of the city when he met [[Father Gapon]] and joined his petition movement; on [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]] he was with a group that was turned back by soldiers before it could reach the [[Winter Palace]].  During the ensuing strikes he took the lead in creating the first [[St. Petersburg Soviet]] in order to coordinate aid and information for the workers; although quiescent much of the year and finally suppressed in December after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], the Soviet was revived during the [[February Revolution]] of 1917.\n\nHe was arrested, imprisoned and deported because of his revolutionary activities after the 1905 Revolution. In 1907 he escaped from prison fled fled to [[Third French Republic|France]]. He settled in [[Paris]] where he completed his studies, came under the influence of Russian [[anarchist]]s and joined the movement, a small group of [[Apollon Karelin]], in 1911.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> Volin's views eventually gravitated towards anarcho-syndicalism, and he decided to leave the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1913.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/> During the first months of the [[First World War]] he participated in the [[Opposition to World War I|International Commission for the Anti-militarist Section]], for which he was detained by the French authorities in 1915. At this point he was married and had four children. He remained in a [[Internment camps in France#World War I and later|concentration camp]] from where he was to be deported, but he escaped with the help of some French comrades and embarked from [[Bordeaux]] to the [[United States]]. \n\nIn America, Volin joined the [[Union of Russian Workers]], which had more than 10,000 members. In the union he was very well received, he was placed in charge of editing its paper, ''[[Golos Truda]]'' (''Voice of the Labor)'', and he was regularly required to attend conferences throughout North America, since it lacked speakers and propagandists. He was a great orator, as the Russian press had pointed out during the events of 1905. His easy speech, the persuasive tone of his voice, the elegance of his imaginative and colorful language, the vigor and the elevation of his thought, attracted the adherence of the masses, who gathered to listen to him.\n\n=== After the Revolution ===\nBut in 1917 he abandoned his work in America to return to [[Petrograd]], in the midst of the [[Russian Revolution]]. Back in [[Russian Republic|Russia]], he verified the weakness of the anarchist movement, due to the little consideration that anarchists in Russia paid to the organization in North America. He tried to solve the disunity of anarchists living in Russia and anarchists who went into exile in the times of the Tsar, but forming the ''Petrograd Union of Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda''. This decided to continue the publication of the Golos Truda, of which Volin continued as editor. After the [[October revolution]], the newspaper was made daily and a Bolshevik-oriented editorial committee was added to it. This committee was not to the liking of Volin, who left the newspaper after the signing of the [[Brest-Litovsk Treaty]].\n\nHe left for [[Bobrov, Bobrovsky District, Voronezh Oblast|Bobrov]], where he worked in the city [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] and was reunited with his wife and four children, back from France. He was in charge of popular education, with the task of bringing the population to an understanding of revolutionary events. Shortly thereafter, he joined the organizers of the Kursk Conference, which commissioned him to draft adopted resolutions and prepare a statement that could be accepted by all the trends and nuances of anarchism - allowing everyone to work in a single organization. Thus, Volin formulated his idea of [[Synthesis anarchism]], which included [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]] and [[Anarcho-individualism|individualism]], since he considered these to be the three main aspects of anarchism.\n\nIn the autumn of 1918, Volin created, together with other colleagues, the [[Nabat]], an organization that had a great capacity for mobilization due to its high number of affiliates.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/>\n\n===The Ukrainian Revolution and the Bolshevik repression===\nIn 1919, Volin decided to join the Makhnovist movement, in the culture and education sector, to organize meetings, conferences, talks, popular councils, as well as the publication of flyers and posters. That same year, Volin was elected president of the Insurgent Council, where he worked intensively for six months.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://libcom.org/library/preface-volin|title=History of the Makhnovist movement, 1918-1921|first=Peter|last=Arshinov|chapter=Preface by Volin}}</ref> His work was interrupted when he fell ill with [[tuberculosis]]. Due to his immobility, he was easily arrested on January 14, 1920 and transferred to [[Moscow]] at the hands of the [[Cheka]]. He was released in October 1920, on the occasion of the alliance signed between the [[Black Army]] and the [[Red Army]] to fight [[Pyotr Wrangel]]'s forces.\n\nHe moved to [[Kharkiv]], where, with the Nabat Confederation, he prepared an anarchist Congress for December 25. On the eve of the congress, the Bolsheviks arrested Volin and the anarchists in attendance, for their membership in libertarian groups. Volin and the other prisoners were transferred to Moscow.\n\nFrom then on he was incarcerated in [[Butyrka prison]] In prison, everyone knew about the Cheka's brutality, against which they protested with a [[hunger strike]] that lasted for ten and a half days, and ended thanks to an unexpected intervention: convinced by [[Emma Goldman]], [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Alexander Shapiro]], the European delegates to a [[Profintern]] Congress obtained the release of ten prisoners, including Volin, on condition of perpetual banishment under threat of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oaca.iespana.es/oaca/biografiasanarquistas.htm|title=Brief biographies of some Anarchists|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218185636/http://oaca.iespana.es/oaca/biografiasanarquistas.htm|archivedate=December 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Russian Anarchists| first=Paul|last=Avrich|editorial=Alianza Editorial, 1974, (p.237)</ref>\n\nAdmitted to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] despite lack of proper documents, he and his family lived in [[Berlin]], where he wrote (in German) an 80-page pamphlet called ''The Persecution of the Anarchists in Soviet Russia'', translated [[Peter Arshinov]]'s ''History of the Makhnovist Movement'' and wrote a long biographical preface for it. Together with Arshinov, he founded a magazine called ''The Anarchist Herald'' and along with other Russian exiles, they formed several committees to help theire comrades imprisoned by the Bolshevik regime. After two years, Volin received an invitation from [[S\u00e9bastien Faure]] to help him prepare the ''Encyclop\u00e9die Anarchiste'', so he moved to [[Paris]], where he wrote for the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' and other publications.<ref name=\"pitzer\"/>\n\nVolin participated in the publication of [[Dielo Truda]] (Causa Obrera), as part of the \"Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad\". However, following the publication of the controversial [[Platformism|Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists]] in 1926, Volin broke with Nestor Makhno and Peter Arshinov. The bitter dispute marked a deep divide within the Russian anarchist movement in exile. In 1927 Volin founded the ''Association des F\u00e9d\u00e9ralistes Anarchistes'', a synthesist organization, and after several rearrangements of the French anarchist organizations, in 1934 he joined the editorial staff of ''Terre Libre''.
