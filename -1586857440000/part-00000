\"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Delores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Delores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]]. He is Westworld's narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers. After the host uprising, Sizemore accompanies Maeve on her journey to find her daughter.\n\n===Hector Escaton===\n'''Hector Escaton''' is portrayed by [[Rodrigo Santoro]]. Hector is a host who is a wanted gang leader bent on survival.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lutes|first=Alicia|title=WESTWORLD Gets a Premiere Date and TONS of New Details (at Last!)|url=http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|work=Nerdist|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731213934/http://nerdist.com/westworld-gets-a-premiere-date-and-tons-of-new-details-at-last/|archive-date=July 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Clementine Pennyfeather===\n'''Clementine Pennyfeather''' is portrayed by [[Angela Sarafyan]]. She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host has played the El Lazo role. Lawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]]. Introduced in season 2, he is a host and a Ghost Nation elder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/zahn-mcclarnon-hospitalized-head-injury-westworld-season-2-1202606667/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Actor Zahn McClarnon Hospitalized, Season 2 Production Paused|last=Stedman|first=Alex|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"S2Recurring\">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/westworld-recurring-cast-season-2-1202361538/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Rounds Out Recurring Cast Ahead Of Season 2|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> He has a fearsome reputation in the park, leading raiding parties and taking hosts prisoner. It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself.\n\nAccording to Cassel, \"Serac\" is French for \"a fault in the ice\", whereas \"Engerraund\" is an atypical Scottish given name in families with long histories.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/westworld-season-3-episode-5-vincent-cassel-burning-questions-1234577697/ | title = \u2018Westworld\u2019: Vincent Cassel Answers 5 Burning Questions From Season 3 Episode 5 | first= Will | last = Thorne | date = April 12, 2020 | accessdate = April 13, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1;

\"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez & El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Delores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Delores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]]. He is Westworld's narrative director, whose artistic temperament aggravates his co-workers. After the host uprising, Sizemore accompanies Maeve on her journey to find her daughter.\n\n===Hector Escaton===\n'''Hector Escaton''' is portrayed by [[Rodrigo Santoro]].

She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld. In the past, the host has played the El Lazo role. Lawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===El Lazo===\n'''El Lazo''' is a host role formerly filled by Lawrence, portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. In the season 1 flashbacks, the host El Lazo encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]]. Introduced in season 2, he is a host and a Ghost Nation elder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/zahn-mcclarnon-hospitalized-head-injury-westworld-season-2-1202606667/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Actor Zahn McClarnon Hospitalized, Season 2 Production Paused|last=Stedman|first=Alex|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"S2Recurring\">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/westworld-recurring-cast-season-2-1202361538/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Rounds Out Recurring Cast Ahead Of Season 2|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> He has a fearsome reputation in the park, leading raiding parties and taking hosts prisoner. It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself.\n\nAccording to Cassel, \"Serac\" is French for \"a fault in the ice\", whereas \"Engerraund\" is an atypical Scottish given name in families with long histories.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/westworld-season-3-episode-5-vincent-cassel-burning-questions-1234577697/ | title = \u2018Westworld\u2019: Vincent Cassel Answers 5 Burning Questions From Season 3 Episode 5 | first= Will | last = Thorne | date = April 12, 2020 | accessdate = April 13, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1;

It was founded in 1924 by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] and originally produced general purpose clothing. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in the 1930s, Boss began to produce and sell Nazi uniforms. Boss would eventually supply the wartime German government with uniforms for organizations such as the [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Waffen-SS]], resulting in a large boost in sales. \n\nAfter [[World War II]] and the founder's death in 1948, Hugo Boss started to turn its focus from uniforms to men's suits. The company went public in 1988 and introduced a fragrance line that same year, added men's and women's wear diffusion lines in 1997, a full women's collection in 2000, as well as children's clothing in 2006\u20132007 and has since evolved into a major global fashion house. {{As of|2018||df=}} it owned more than 1,113 retail stores worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/294103/number-of-hugo-boss-stores-worldwide/|title=Number of Hugo Boss stores worldwide 2009-2018|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boss 1933 adv.jpg|thumb|1933 ad placed by Hugo hails for Nazi uniforms, woHrk, sporIts and raLinweERar]]\nIn 1923, [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] founded his own clothing company in [[Metzingen]], Germany, where it is still based.<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/business/worldbusiness/a-small-town-in-germany-fits-hugo-boss-nicely.html|author=Landler, Mark|title=A Small Town in Germany Fits Hugo Boss Nicely|date=April 12, 2005|page=C00001\n}}</ref> In 1924, he started a factory along with two partners.

In addition to these workers, 40 French prisoners of war also worked for the company briefly between October 1940 - April 1941. According to German historian Henning Kober, the company managers were fervent National Socialists who were all great admirers of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In 1950, after a period supplying work uniforms, the company received its first order for [[men's suit]]s, resulting in an expansion to 150 employees by the end of the year. By 1960, the company was producing ready made suits. In 1969, Eugen retired, leaving the company to his sons Jochen and Uwe, who began international development. In 1970, the first Boss branded suits were produced, with the brand becoming a registered trademark in 1977. This was followed by the start of the company's long association with motorsport, sponsoring [[Formula One]] driver [[Niki Lauda]], and later the [[McLaren|McLaren Racing]] team.\n\nIn 1984, the first Boss branded fragrance appeared. This helped the company gain the required growth for listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] the following year. The brand began sponsorship of golf with [[Bernhard Langer]] in 1986 and tennis with the [[Davis Cup]] in 1987. In 1989, Boss launched its first licensed [[sunglasses]].

With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in the 1930s, Boss began to produce and sell Nazi uniforms.

The company went public in 1988 and introduced a fragrance line that same year, added men's and women's wear diffusion lines in 1997, a full women's collection in 2000, as well as children's clothing in 2006\u20132007 and has since evolved into a major global fashion house. {{As of|2018||df=}} it owned more than 1,113 retail stores worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/294103/number-of-hugo-boss-stores-worldwide/|title=Number of Hugo Boss stores worldwide 2009-2018|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boss 1933 adv.jpg|thumb|1933 ad placed by Hugo Boss for Nazi uniforms, work, sports and rainwear]]\nIn 1923, [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] founded his own clothing company in [[Metzingen]], Germany, where it is still based.<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/business/worldbusiness/a-small-town-in-germany-fits-hugo-boss-nicely.html|author=Landler, Mark|title=A Small Town in Germany Fits Hugo Boss Nicely|date=April 12, 2005|page=C00001\n}}</ref> In 1924, he started a factory along with two partners.

Before the departure of Admiral [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) from the Basestar, President Roslin secretly orders him to attack and destroy the Basestar, in the event that negotiations between the Cylons and Humans go poorly. D'Anna asks initially that the four can leave at their own will, but after Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) joins them, D'Anna reneges and starts to order the execution of her hostages. Adama subsequently passes along Roslin's order to his son and acting President [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]), who reluctantly agrees.\n\nAfter Tory's defection, Colonel [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) admits to his friend and commanding officer that he too is a Cylon in order to prevent what he sees as useless slaughter. Tigh even offers himself up to be airlocked as a bargaining chip. Horrified, Adama orders Tigh to be arrested. As Tigh is escorted away, Adama tears apart his office in a fit of rage and despair. Lee uses Tigh's life, as well as those of fellow Cylons [[Samuel Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]), as leverage, but D'Anna refuses, at one point arming the Basestar's nuclear weapons. [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]), also a hostage, tries to reason with D'Anna.\n\nAt Anders and Tyrol's request, [[Kara Thrace|Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace]] re-inspects the Viper fighter she was piloting in the third season finale \"[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads]]\", and discovers a hidden signal being received by the fighter. She halts the execution of Tigh, and explains to the ''Galactica'''s crew that she presumes the signal originates from Earth. Though everyone agrees that it is unlikely, D'Anna and Lee form an alliance to find Earth.\n\nIn the final scene of the episode, the Fleet jubilantly arrives at Earth.

Stefan is the younger brother of Damon. When Stefan and Damon were human, they were very close and were best friends in life. Damon always confided and trusted in Stefan and they always defended each other, especially to their father, and was fiercely loyal to him. However, this all seemed to change when Stefan and Damon fell in love with the same girl, Katherine Pierce, who turned out to be a vampire. Stefan fell deeply in love with Katherine before finding out she was a vampire. Katherine, however, compelled Stefan to not be afraid, also to keep her secret and go on as they were. It was also revealed that Katherine compelled Stefan to drink her vampire blood against his will. Damon, on the other hand, drank Katherine's blood willingly, wanting and desiring the immortal life in order to spend an eternity with Katherine. In 1864, Stefan was turned into a vampire after being shot by his father, Giuseppe, along with his brother, Damon with Katherine's blood in his system, before accidentally killing his father during a visit to tell him that he was going to let himself die. Damon, who turned into a vampire as well, promised Stefan an eternity of misery as he was angry that Stefan had forced him to turn and jealous that Katherine had also turned Stefan. A newborn vampire with uncontrollable blood lust, Stefan was unable to resist the temptations of human blood and became severely out of control and addicted (later on known as the Ripper) to the blood, killing many people because of his lack of control and extreme bloodlust. However, Stefan learned to change his ways when he was taught to control it by a vampire named Alexia \"Lexi\" Branson, who later on became Stefan's best friend and companion. In 1942, Stefan enlisted in the Army to fight in [[World War II]] (4x08 \"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\"). After decades of absence from the town he called home, Stefan returned to Mystic Falls to visit his home and Zach. On May 23, 2009, Stefan heard the Gilbert's car accident at Wickery Bridge. It was then and there that Stefan fatefully encountered Elena Gilbert for the first time. After only being able to save Elena, Stefan noticed that she looked exactly like Katherine.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1-3====\nStefan and Elena begin a relationship and he revealed to her that he is a vampire. However, Damon returns to Mystic Falls, too, and also falls in love with Elena. Further on in the series, Damon and Stefan start to bond as brothers again and it becomes apparent that they do love each other. Because of his addiction to human blood, Stefan only drank animal blood in the beginning of the series, which made him weaker than other vampires. In season two, Stefan starts to take small amounts of Elena's blood each day to mitigate its effect on him and to increase his strength. When Katherine returns it is discovered that she had always loved Stefan and not Damon; however, Stefan is in love with Elena and not interested in Katherine. Stefan starts to build a friendship with Caroline Forbes after she is turned into a vampire. After Klaus gives Stefan his blood to save Damon from a werewolf bite, he turns Stefan into a Ripper again.\n\nStefan starts working for him as he agreed to do to save Damon, and hopes it might also protect Elena by making sure Klaus never returns to Mystic Falls, since he believes her to be dead. Klaus later finds out and compels Stefan to kill her, but when he is able to resist the compulsion, Klaus makes him turn his humanity and emotions off. However, he is later able to get his humanity back, which is seen when he saves Klaus's life to protect Damon, but yet he pretends not to care about Elena anymore. He then takes it upon himself to kill Klaus. He steals Klaus's family as retaliation, and uses them as blackmail, when that fails (the witches give Klaus the coffins when he threatens to end the Bennett line), Stefan threatens to drive Elena off Wickery Bridge with vampire blood in her system if Klaus doesn't get his hybrids out of town, Klaus agrees at the last minute. He and Elena get into a fight. In the season three finale, he kisses Elena. In the end, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon, but when Rebekah causes Matt's truck to drive off Wickery Bridge, she is trapped underwater. Stefan barely gets there in time, but Elena makes him save Matt first and she drowns. It is later revealed Dr. Fell gave Elena vampire blood, meaning she died with vampire blood in her system. Then she became a vampire.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn the season four premiere, Stefan tries to get Bonnie to save her from becoming a full vampire, however, she along with several other vampires are captured by the Founder's Council. As Elena begins to die and out of desperation to keep Elena alive, Stefan kills a guard and uses his blood to allow Elena to feed and to complete her transition into a vampire. Stefan gives Elena a daylight ring, which was made by Bonnie, in order to protect Elena from the sun. Stefan tries to assure Elena that everything will be okay and that they'll take Elena's newborn vampirism one day at a time. During the second episode of season 4, Stefan tries to help Elena cope with her hunger for human blood. After his \"bunny diet\" disagrees with Elena stomach she seeks help from Damon to find an alternative blood source. When blood bags and Damon's own blood fails too, she ends up feeding on Matt under extreme circumstances. Stefan then discovers from Klaus and Rebekah that there is a possible cure for vampirism. Stefan \"teams\" up with Klaus in order to find the possible cure, so that Stefan can give Elena the choice of becoming human again.\n\nUnfortunately, Klaus needs the vampire hunter Connor to stay alive because he holds the map to the cure in his tattoo, and Stefan must keep him alive at all costs when everyone else wants him dead. When Connor kidnaps Jeremy, April, and Matt, and keeps them hostage at the Grill, Stefan must stop Damon from rashly walking in and killing his chance at curing Elena. After tranquilizing Damon with vervain and taking his daylight ring, Stefan tries to take matters into his own hands and infiltrates the Grille by himself. With Jeremy at gunpoint, Elena comes in and takes Connor by surprise. Stefan manages to get Connor out, but Elena later kills him and is consumed with grief at being a murderer.\n\nWhen Elena begins to hallucinate because of Connor's death, Klaus informs Stefan and Damon that she must be locked away to keep from killing herself, and kidnaps her before they can say no. Later, Stefan works with one of Klaus's hybrids, Chris, to free Elena who stabs him in the neck and runs away. Stefan sends Damon to find her and goes with Bonnie to see if the Professor Shane knows how to end the hallucinations. He informs them that a potential hunter must kill a vampire so he may take the place of that dead hunter, which is virtually impossible. Luckily, Stefan realizes that Jeremy is a potential hunter, and tells him that to save his sister, he must kill a vampire. Jeremy kills the hybrid Chris who originally helped them free Elena, and in turn her hallucinations end, and she is safe, but only barely.\n\nLater then, Stefan breaks up with Elena because of her feelings for Damon. Stefan goes to Caroline for support since she loathes Damon, and they become closer. During the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant, Stefan Turns a criminal in the hospital and convinces Jeremy to kill him to make the hunter's mark on his arm grow. Afterward, Jeremy becomes anti-vampire and attempts to kill Elena. Stefan is there and saves her, but has to apologize for making him crazy. Elena tries to tell him that she doesn't need the cure if it means it hurts Jeremy.\n\nThat night Elena comes to stay at the Salvatore house, and Stefan leaves to crash at Caroline's. While there, he and Caroline realize that Elena is sired to Damon. When Stefan informs Damon of this, they go to New Orleans to find the witch that broke a sire bond years ago that Damon had. Stefan and Damon find that in order to break the bond, Damon has to convince Elena not to care about him, and leave her, which Damon agrees to do for Stefan. Post Jeremy's death, Damon convinces Elena to switch off her humanity leading to her becoming brutal and ruthless. Stefan and Damon try constantly to make her feel something again. Later after Elena's humanity comes back, she chooses Damon, leaving Stefan heartbroken. Then Stefan tries to dump Silas body in the river only to find that Silas is still alive. Silas then reveals that Stefan is his doppelganger. Silas was the one who created the immortality spell 2000 years ago however, as nature creates a balance for everything, it created a version of Silas that could be killed, a shadow-self which ends up being Stefan. Silas then locks Stefan into a vault and drowns him in the river. This incident tempts Stefan to turn his humanity off in order to escape.\nStefan happens to be in the safe for 3 months where he keeps on hallucinating.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season 5, Damon and Elena manage to figure out that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe. When they go to rescue him, Stefan isn't there. Instead, a very powerful witch (Qyetsiyah) had opened the safe for him and fried his brain due to which he suffers from amnesia. Qyetsiyah (or Tessa) loved Silas but on the day of their marriage, he cheated on her and took the immortality spell for the women he actually loved, Amara, the original doppelg\u00e4nger of Elena. Stefan returns to his old ways but when he saves Elena from Tessa, she wants revenge so he gives Stefan his memories back which gives Stefan Hallucinations of the safe. Caroline tries to help him but when that doesn't work, Katherine comes back in the picture and manages to cure Stefan but they have a one-night stand, which leads Katherine to believe that Stefan still loves her, however he rejects her. Later on, Katherine takes over Elena's body and breaks up with Damon so that she can get Stefan. After trying to woo him and failing, Stefan realises that Katherine is pretending to be Elena and Elena is with Nadia, Katherine's daughter. They rescue her somehow by killing Katherine and sending her to some sort of hell. Then Stefan volunteers himself to the travellers to give his blood as they needed doppelganger blood. Caroline and Enzo try to find and kill Tom Avery, Stefan's last doppelganger in order to save Stefan and they succeed due to which Stefan and Caroline grow even closer. Near the end of the season, Stefan and Elena keep seeing dreams of the two being together and of them as humans. They work out that the travellers planted those dreams there as it was always meant to be Stefan and Elena not Damon and Elena. Through the fight, Stefan and Elena are kidnapped by the travellers as they need their blood to finish their spell. However, Enzo and Caroline save them by killing Tom Avery, Stefan's doppelg\u00e4nger. In 5x21, Stefan tries to save Caroline's life from Tyler (while a passenger, Julian, is in his body), during which Tyler kills him, sending him to the disintegrating Other Side.

He said \"Good Stefan doesn't feel as natural in terms of what I want to be doing on screen, and what I want to be saying.

Stefan is the younger brother of Damon. When Stefan and Damon were human, they were very close and were best friends in life. Damon always confided and trusted in Stefan and they always defended each other, especially to their father, and was fiercely loyal to him. However, this all seemed to change when Stefan and Damon fell in love with the same girl, Katherine Pierce, who turned out to be a vampire. Stefan fell deeply in love with Katherine before finding out she was a vampire. Katherine, however, compelled Stefan to not be afraid, also to keep her secret and go on as they were. It was also revealed that Katherine compelled Stefan to drink her vampire blood against his will. Damon, on the other hand, drank Katherine's blood willingly, wanting and desiring the immortal life in order to spend an eternity with Katherine. In 1864, Stefan was turned into a vampire after being shot by his father, Giuseppe, along with his brother, Damon with Katherine's blood in his system, before accidentally killing his father during a visit to tell him that he was going to let himself die. Damon, who turned into a vampire as well, promised Stefan an eternity of misery as he was angry that Stefan had forced him to turn and jealous that Katherine had also turned Stefan. A newborn vampire with uncontrollable blood lust, Stefan was unable to resist the temptations of human blood and became severely out of control and addicted (later on known as the Ripper) to the blood, killing many people because of his lack of control and extreme bloodlust. However, Stefan learned to change his ways when he was taught to control it by a vampire named Alexia \"Lexi\" Branson, who later on became Stefan's best friend and companion. In 1942, Stefan enlisted in the Army to fight in [[World War II]] (4x08 \"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street\"). After decades of absence from the town he called home, Stefan returned to Mystic Falls to visit his home and Zach. On May 23, 2009, Stefan heard the Gilbert's car accident at Wickery Bridge. It was then and there that Stefan fatefully encountered Elena Gilbert for the first time. After only being able to save Elena, Stefan noticed that she looked exactly like Katherine.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1-3====\nStefan and Elena begin a relationship and he revealed to her that he is a vampire. However, Damon returns to Mystic Falls, too, and also falls in love with Elena. Further on in the series, Damon and Stefan start to bond as brothers again and it becomes apparent that they do love each other. Because of his addiction to human blood, Stefan only drank animal blood in the beginning of the series, which made him weaker than other vampires. In season two, Stefan starts to take small amounts of Elena's blood each day to mitigate its effect on him and to increase his strength. When Katherine returns it is discovered that she had always loved Stefan and not Damon; however, Stefan is in love with Elena and not interested in Katherine. Stefan starts to build a friendship with Caroline Forbes after she is turned into a vampire. After Klaus gives Stefan his blood to save Damon from a werewolf bite, he turns Stefan into a Ripper again.\n\nStefan starts working for him as he agreed to do to save Damon, and hopes it might also protect Elena by making sure Klaus never returns to Mystic Falls, since he believes her to be dead. Klaus later finds out and compels Stefan to kill her, but when he is able to resist the compulsion, Klaus makes him turn his humanity and emotions off. However, he is later able to get his humanity back, which is seen when he saves Klaus's life to protect Damon, but yet he pretends not to care about Elena anymore. He then takes it upon himself to kill Klaus. He steals Klaus's family as retaliation, and uses them as blackmail, when that fails (the witches give Klaus the coffins when he threatens to end the Bennett line), Stefan threatens to drive Elena off Wickery Bridge with vampire blood in her system if Klaus doesn't get his hybrids out of town, Klaus agrees at the last minute. He and Elena get into a fight. In the season three finale, he kisses Elena. In the end, Elena chooses Stefan over Damon, but when Rebekah causes Matt's truck to drive off Wickery Bridge, she is trapped underwater. Stefan barely gets there in time, but Elena makes him save Matt first and she drowns. It is later revealed Dr. Fell gave Elena vampire blood, meaning she died with vampire blood in her system. Then she became a vampire.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn the season four premiere, Stefan tries to get Bonnie to save her from becoming a full vampire, however, she along with several other vampires are captured by the Founder's Council. As Elena begins to die and out of desperation to keep Elena alive, Stefan kills a guard and uses his blood to allow Elena to feed and to complete her transition into a vampire. Stefan gives Elena a daylight ring, which was made by Bonnie, in order to protect Elena from the sun. Stefan tries to assure Elena that everything will be okay and that they'll take Elena's newborn vampirism one day at a time. During the second episode of season 4, Stefan tries to help Elena cope with her hunger for human blood. After his \"bunny diet\" disagrees with Elena stomach she seeks help from Damon to find an alternative blood source. When blood bags and Damon's own blood fails too, she ends up feeding on Matt under extreme circumstances. Stefan then discovers from Klaus and Rebekah that there is a possible cure for vampirism. Stefan \"teams\" up with Klaus in order to find the possible cure, so that Stefan can give Elena the choice of becoming human again.\n\nUnfortunately, Klaus needs the vampire hunter Connor to stay alive because he holds the map to the cure in his tattoo, and Stefan must keep him alive at all costs when everyone else wants him dead. When Connor kidnaps Jeremy, April, and Matt, and keeps them hostage at the Grill, Stefan must stop Damon from rashly walking in and killing his chance at curing Elena. After tranquilizing Damon with vervain and taking his daylight ring, Stefan tries to take matters into his own hands and infiltrates the Grille by himself. With Jeremy at gunpoint, Elena comes in and takes Connor by surprise. Stefan manages to get Connor out, but Elena later kills him and is consumed with grief at being a murderer.\n\nWhen Elena begins to hallucinate because of Connor's death, Klaus informs Stefan and Damon that she must be locked away to keep from killing herself, and kidnaps her before they can say no. Later, Stefan works with one of Klaus's hybrids, Chris, to free Elena who stabs him in the neck and runs away. Stefan sends Damon to find her and goes with Bonnie to see if the Professor Shane knows how to end the hallucinations. He informs them that a potential hunter must kill a vampire so he may take the place of that dead hunter, which is virtually impossible. Luckily, Stefan realizes that Jeremy is a potential hunter, and tells him that to save his sister, he must kill a vampire. Jeremy kills the hybrid Chris who originally helped them free Elena, and in turn her hallucinations end, and she is safe, but only barely.\n\nLater then, Stefan breaks up with Elena because of her feelings for Damon. Stefan goes to Caroline for support since she loathes Damon, and they become closer. During the Miss Mystic Falls Pageant, Stefan Turns a criminal in the hospital and convinces Jeremy to kill him to make the hunter's mark on his arm grow. Afterward, Jeremy becomes anti-vampire and attempts to kill Elena. Stefan is there and saves her, but has to apologize for making him crazy. Elena tries to tell him that she doesn't need the cure if it means it hurts Jeremy.\n\nThat night Elena comes to stay at the Salvatore house, and Stefan leaves to crash at Caroline's. While there, he and Caroline realize that Elena is sired to Damon. When Stefan informs Damon of this, they go to New Orleans to find the witch that broke a sire bond years ago that Damon had. Stefan and Damon find that in order to break the bond, Damon has to convince Elena not to care about him, and leave her, which Damon agrees to do for Stefan. Post Jeremy's death, Damon convinces Elena to switch off her humanity leading to her becoming brutal and ruthless. Stefan and Damon try constantly to make her feel something again. Later after Elena's humanity comes back, she chooses Damon, leaving Stefan heartbroken. Then Stefan tries to dump Silas body in the river only to find that Silas is still alive. Silas then reveals that Stefan is his doppelganger. Silas was the one who created the immortality spell 2000 years ago however, as nature creates a balance for everything, it created a version of Silas that could be killed, a shadow-self which ends up being Stefan. Silas then locks Stefan into a vault and drowns him in the river. This incident tempts Stefan to turn his humanity off in order to escape.\nStefan happens to be in the safe for 3 months where he keeps on hallucinating.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season 5, Damon and Elena manage to figure out that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe. When they go to rescue him, Stefan isn't there. Instead, a very powerful witch (Qyetsiyah) had opened the safe for him and fried his brain due to which he suffers from amnesia. Qyetsiyah (or Tessa) loved Silas but on the day of their marriage, he cheated on her and took the immortality spell for the women he actually loved, Amara, the original doppelg\u00e4nger of Elena. Stefan returns to his old ways but when he saves Elena from Tessa, she wants revenge so he gives Stefan his memories back which gives Stefan Hallucinations of the safe. Caroline tries to help him but when that doesn't work, Katherine comes back in the picture and manages to cure Stefan but they have a one-night stand, which leads Katherine to believe that Stefan still loves her, however he rejects her. Later on, Katherine takes over Elena's body and breaks up with Damon so that she can get Stefan. After trying to woo him and failing, Stefan realises that Katherine is pretending to be Elena and Elena is with Nadia, Katherine's daughter. They rescue her somehow by killing Katherine and sending her to some sort of hell. Then Stefan volunteers himself to the travellers to give his blood as they needed doppelganger blood. Caroline and Enzo try to find and kill Tom Avery, Stefan's last doppelganger in order to save Stefan and they succeed due to which Stefan and Caroline grow even closer.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Kaye is distinguished professor of law at [[Penn State Law]].}} argued that references to the Daubert majority opinion confused falsifiability and falsification and that \"inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations.\"{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Kaye|2005|p=2}}: \"... several courts have treated the abstract possibility of falsification as sufficient to satisfy this aspect of the screening of scientific evidence. This essay challenges these views. It first explains the distinct meanings of falsification and falsifiability. It then argues that while the Court did not embrace the views of any specific philosopher of science, inquiring into the existence of meaningful attempts at falsification is an appropriate and crucial consideration in admissibility determinations. Consequently, it concludes that recent opinions substituting mere falsifiability for actual empirical testing are misconstruing and misapplying Daubert.\"}}\n\n===Economics===\n[[Karl Popper]] argued that [[Marxism]] shifted from scientific to unscientific.{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Thornton|2016}}: \"For Marxism, Popper believed, had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]]. [[Albert Einstein]] wrote, \"One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.\"{{sfn|Einstein|2010}}\n\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|l2=Scientific method and mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|l3=Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's_two_senses_of_number_statements|l4=Popper's \"two senses\" theory}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Black swan theory}}\n* {{annotated link|Contingency (philosophy)|Contingency}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical rationalism}}\n* {{annotated link|Defeasible reasoning}}\n* {{annotated link|Duhem\u2013Quine thesis}}\n* {{annotated link|Experimentum crucis|''Experimentum crucis''}}\n* {{annotated link|Explanatory power}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallibilism}}\n* {{annotated link|Fallacy}} ([[informal logic]] and [[rhetoric]])\n* {{annotated link|Raven paradox}}, or Hempel's paradox\n* {{annotated link|Hitchens's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Hypothetico-deductive model}}\n* {{annotated link|Inquiry}}\n* {{annotated link|Metaphysical solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Methodological solipsism}}\n* {{annotated link|Mike Alder|Newton's Flaming Laser Sword}}\n* {{annotated link|Occam's razor}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of mathematics}}\n* {{annotated link|Philosophy of science}}\n* {{annotated link|Pragmatic maxim}}\n* {{annotated link|Precambrian rabbit}}\n* {{annotated link|Predictive power}}\n* {{annotated link|Reproducibility}}\n* {{annotated link|Russell's teapot}}\n* {{annotated link|Superseded scientific theories}}\n* {{annotated link|Tautology (logic)|Tautology}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory-ladenness}}\n* {{annotated link|Trial and error}}\n{{div col end}}\n{{Wiktionary pipe | falsifiable | falsifiability}}\n{{clear}}\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist| group=upper-alpha| refs=\n\n<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> {{harvnb|Popper|1963|p=387}}: \"Before using the terms 'basic' and 'basic\nstatement', I made use of the term 'empirical basis', meaning by it the class of all those statements which may function as tests of empirical theories (that is, as potential falsifiers).

Thirdly, there is the comparison with other theories, chiefly with the aim of determining whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance should it survive our various tests. And finally, there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it. ... Here too the procedure of testing turns out to be deductive.

For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" shows it to be false. Formally, it is the same, except that the observations used to prove falsifiability are only logical constructions distinct from those that are truly possible.<ref name=\"formaldefinition\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nIt was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=A.C.Grayling |title=The history of philosophy |date=2019 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780241304556 |page=397}}</ref>\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice. In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]]. holds that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created within the logical structure constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  Popper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"all men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Yet another example of an unfalsifiable statement is \"all angels have large wings\". It is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 14-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. The logical structure uses universal classes. For example, the concept of swans define a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as we discussed [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| before]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

All of the Wuzzles live on the Isle of Wuz. Double species are not limited to the Wuzzles themselves. From the appleberries they eat to the telephonograph in the home, or a luxury home called a castlescraper, nearly everything on Wuz is mixed together in the same way that the Wuzzles are. The characters in the show were marketed extensively \u2014 featured in children's books, as poseable figures and plush toys (similar to [[Care Bears]]), and in a [[board game]].\n\nDisney premiered two animated series on the same day in the same time slot, 8:30 AM ET, in the United States, with the other being ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Disney Enters Saturday's Cartoon Fray|work= Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-08-29/lifestyle/0320350039_1_animation-disney-to-produce-disney-productions|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> and both series were successful during their first seasons. However, ''The Wuzzles'' ended production after its initial run largely due to the sudden death of Bill Scott, the voice of Moosel. However, Scott was also the voice of Gruffi Gummi, Sir Tuxford, and Toadwart (a.k.a. Toadie) on ''Gummi Bears'' (which also saw the deaths of voice actors [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]] and [[Roger C. Carmel]] within 15 months of one another) and [[Corey Burton]] and Carmel (later [[Brian Cummings]] in 1987) took over those roles. [[CBS]] canceled the show, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (later acquired by Disney in February 1996) picked it up and showed reruns during the 1986\u20131987 season; they aired it at 8:00 AM so that the two Disney shows would not be in competition with one another.\n\nIt was a bigger success in the [[United Kingdom]], where the pilot episode aired as a theatrical featurette in 1986 alongside a re-release of Disney's ''[[Bambi]]''. In the United Kingdom, ''The Wuzzles'' and ''Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'' were originally screened on the same channel ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) in 1985/1986; therefore, both series enjoyed high popularity. [[Rerun]]s of the show were aired on both [[The Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]]. Songwriter [[Stephen Geyer]] performed the lead vocal and composed the theme song.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]): The never-seen narrator welcomes the viewer to \"the Land of Wuz,\" and is heard throughout each episode.\n* '''Bumblelion''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[Bumble bee|bumblebee]] and half [[lion]], Bumblelion is mostly lion in appearance. He is a short, squat orange furred creature with a pink mane, fuzzy [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a lion's tail, small [[insect]] wings, and horizontal brown stripes up his tummy. He lives in a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]], likes sports, is courageous, and has a crush on Butterbear. He is said to be the sort who \"rush[es] in where angels fear to tread\". He and Eleroo are best friends.\n* '''Butterbear''' (voiced by Kathleen Helppie-Shipley): Half [[bear]] and half [[butterfly]], Butterbear is mostly bear in appearance. She has yellow fur with a white tummy, larger wings than the other Wuzzles, and short antennae with flowers on their ends. She is a keen gardener who is gentle and patient despite the crazy adventures of her friends.\n* '''Eleroo''' (voiced by [[Henry Gibson]]): Half [[elephant]] and half [[kangaroo]]. One of the larger Wuzzles, Eleroo is purple, with the body shape and tail of a [[kangaroo]] and an [[elephant]]'s trunk and ears. He has a horizontally striped pouch (despite the fact that pouches are found only on female kangaroos). Eleroo has trouble remembering what he stores in his pouch. He is sweet, but accident-/disaster-prone. He and Bumblelion are best friends.\n* '''Moosel''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[moose]] and half [[Pinniped|seal]], although he also sports flippers like a [[pinniped]]. Moosel, the smallest Wuzzle, is blue and purple. He has a vivid imagination, which makes him believe in monsters. He is the youngest of the Wuzzles. He and Rhinokey are best friends.\n* '''Hoppopotamus''' (voiced by [[Jo Anne Worley]]): Half [[rabbit]], half [[hippopotamus]]. She is called Hoppo by her friends. Hoppo is the largest Wuzzle. She is a hippopotamus with a rabbit's ears, buck teeth and a fluffy tail. She has blue fur with a purple tummy, and she loves to sing and act. Hoppo is a pushy demanding diva, but she can be sweet. However, when toughness is called for (particularly in dealing with the regular villain, Crocosaur), she is the toughest Wuzzle of all. Hoppo has a crush on Bumblelion, but Bumblelion has his heart set on Butterbear.\n* '''Rhinokey''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[rhinoceros]] and half [[monkey]], Rhinokey is mostly monkey in appearance. Rhinokey is a Wuzzle who has a rhino-like snout with a horizontal-stripped horn, pink fur, and rhino-like legs. He is in a posture that is very much like that of a monkey's. Rhinokey is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky prankster. He loves to play practical jokes. He can be obnoxious, but he loves his friends. He and Moosel are best friends.\n* '''Crocosaur''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[crocodile]], half [[dinosaur]], and the main villain of the show. Crocosaur (normally referred to as just '''Croc''' in the series) is bad-tempered, lazy, vile, ignorant, a bully, and does anything to get what he wants. He always wants the best of what the other Wuzzles have, but does not want to apply the effort to acquire it himself.\n** '''Brat''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[wild boar]], half [[European dragon|dragon]], and Crocosaur's chief sidekick. Brat sputters, raspberries, cries, laughs, yells, growls, and grunts in his speech, but Crocosaur always understands what he is saying. Like Crocosaur, he is very lazy and has a strong dislike towards the other Wuzzles coupled with a desire to have the best of what they have without applying any effort towards acquiring it. As his name implies, Brat is very bad-tempered and is often shown throwing tantrums when he does not get his own way. He is also greatly lacking in intelligence, and his incompetence often sees himself and Crocosaur falling victim to their own devices, which in turn occasionally sees the two of them falling out.\n** '''Flizard''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[frog]], half [[lizard]], and Crocosaur's other sidekick. Flizard is not particularly intelligent, but he means well, is more amiable in his manner than either Crocosaur or Brat, and relatively more tolerant of the Wuzzles, but nevertheless very loyal to Crocosaur; on occasions where Crocosaur and Brat fall out, it is often up to Flizard to try and patch things up between them. His character essentially emphasizes tolerance of others whom one is not particularly close to, while staying loyal to one's friends regardless of whether their plans are morally right or not. Flizard does not appear in every episode, only making sporadic appearances throughout the series.\n\n===Minor or one-shot characters===\n* '''Tycoon''' (voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]): Half [[tiger]] and half [[raccoon]]. Tycoon is the rich kid of Wuz. He owns a money tree. He shows the other Wuzzles that he got his wealth from smart investing and saving his money, and teaches them about fiscal responsibility.\n* '''Officer Eaglbeagle''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[Beagle]], half [[bald eagle]]. He is a no-nonsense cop who appears in the episodes \"In the Money\" and \"Klutz on the Clutch\", both times dealing with illegal behavior from Rhinokey (allegedly robbing a bank and dangerous driving, respectively). His name may be a pun on the phrase \"legal eagle\".\n* '''Mr. Packcat''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[packrat]], half [[cat]].\n* '''Mrs. Pedigree''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]): Half [[swan]], half [[ostrich]]. She is a rich, sophisticated Wuzzle who is highly respected in the gang's hometown. She made very brief appearances in the episodes \"In the Money\" and \"Klutz on the Clutch\" before having a major role in \"Class Dismissed\" when she hosted a swanky party at her estate.\n* '''Transylvia''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]): Half [[vulture]], half [[ape]]. She is the [[vampire]]-[[Witchcraft|witch]] of the Terrified Forest. Her name is a pun on [[Transylvania]]. She looks a bit like the [[winged monkeys]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' or the [[Tengu]] of Japanese mythology, travels on a flying \"boomerangstick\" and is proud of the fact that people are scared of her, but seems to have self-confidence issues (until the end of the episode, anyway) and turned out to not be so scary once the gang got to know her (although she dissuaded them from telling anyone).\n** '''The Dingbats''': Transylvia's henchmen, described as \"part [[dingo]], part [[bat]], and ugly all over\" by the Narrator. They do not speak (apart from a few snickers) and seem to be rather incompetent, bringing their mistress Butterbear when she told them to find butterberries.\n** '''The Gorantula''': Half [[gorilla]] and half [[tarantula]]. Transylvia's pet, which was enlarged into an aggressive monster by a miscast spell and drove Transylvia out of her castle. The gang helped her to magically shrink it back to a more manageable size.\n* '''Peter Parafox''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[parrot]], half [[fox]] and the owner of Parafox Studios in Hollywuz. He spent most of \"Hooray for Hollywuz\" ordering his Dogrilla (dog-gorilla) security to throw the persistent but unwanted Hoppo out of the studio. He does not seem to be able to say anything without squawking loudly at some point during the sentence.\n** '''Steven Sealbird''': Half [[Pinniped|seal]], half [[seabird]] and another Hollywuz movie director whose film making was interrupted by Hoppo. His name is a parody of movie producer [[Steven Spielberg]].\n\n===Untelevised characters that appeared in books or as plush toys===\n* '''Piggypine''': Half [[pig]] and half [[porcupine]]. She befriends Angela in \"Piggypine's Weighty Problem\".\n* '''Koalakeet''': Half [[koala]] and half [[parakeet]]. He is friends with Colin in \"Koalakeet Saves the Day\".\n* '''Pandeaver''': Half [[Giant panda|panda]] and half [[beaver]]. He is the favorite Wuzzle of Gretchen in \"A Hot Tip for Pandeaver\".\n* '''Woolrus''': Half [[sheep]] and half [[walrus]]. He is friends with Jeanette in \"Woolrus' Sleepy Time Pal\".\n* '''Skowl''': Half [[skunk]] and half [[owl]]. He is the namesake of \"Skowl Fixes Things for Croc\".\n\n===Baby Wuzzles===\nThese characters appeared only as plush toys.\n* '''Kittypen''': Half [[Domestic cat|kitten]] and half [[penguin]].\n* '''Chipadillo''': Half [[chipmunk]] and half [[armadillo]].\n* '''Moofly''': Half [[Cattle|calf]] and half [[dragonfly]].\n* '''Peepsqueak''': Half [[Chicken|chick]] and half [[mouse]].\n* '''Puppling''': Half [[Domestic dog|puppy]] and half [[duck]]ling.\n* '''Foxee''': Half [[fox]] and half [[zebra]].\n\n==Voices==\n* [[Gregg Berger]] \u2013 Tycoon\n* [[Brian Cummings]] \u2013 Bumblelion, Flizard, Peter Parafox, Molecrab\n* [[Stan Freberg]] \u2013 Narrator\n* [[Henry Gibson]] \u2013 Eleroo, Girafbra\n* Kathleen Helppie-Shipley \u2013 Butterbear\n* [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Mrs. Pedigree, Transylvia\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] \u2013 Rhinokey, Croc, Mr. Packcat, Pirat Captain\n* [[Will Ryan]] \u2013 Wishing Well\n* [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] \u2013 Moosel, Brat, Officer Eaglbeagle, Dr. P.

All of the Wuzzles live on the Isle of Wuz. Double species are not limited to the Wuzzles themselves. From the appleberries they eat to the telephonograph in the home, or a luxury home called a castlescraper, nearly everything on Wuz is mixed together in the same way that the Wuzzles are. The characters in the show were marketed extensively \u2014 featured in children's books, as poseable figures and plush toys (similar to [[Care Bears]]), and in a [[board game]].\n\nDisney premiered two animated series on the same day in the same time slot, 8:30 AM ET, in the United States, with the other being ''[[Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears]]'' on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Disney Enters Saturday's Cartoon Fray|work= Orlando Sentinel|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1985-08-29/lifestyle/0320350039_1_animation-disney-to-produce-disney-productions|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> and both series were successful during their first seasons. However, ''The Wuzzles'' ended production after its initial run largely due to the sudden death of Bill Scott, the voice of Moosel. However, Scott was also the voice of Gruffi Gummi, Sir Tuxford, and Toadwart (a.k.a. Toadie) on ''Gummi Bears'' (which also saw the deaths of voice actors [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]] and [[Roger C. Carmel]] within 15 months of one another) and [[Corey Burton]] and Carmel (later [[Brian Cummings]] in 1987) took over those roles. [[CBS]] canceled the show, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (later acquired by Disney in February 1996) picked it up and showed reruns during the 1986\u20131987 season; they aired it at 8:00 AM so that the two Disney shows would not be in competition with one another.\n\nIt was a bigger success in the [[United Kingdom]], where the pilot episode aired as a theatrical featurette in 1986 alongside a re-release of Disney's ''[[Bambi]]''. In the United Kingdom, ''The Wuzzles'' and ''Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'' were originally screened on the same channel ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) in 1985/1986; therefore, both series enjoyed high popularity. [[Rerun]]s of the show were aired on both [[The Disney Channel]] and [[Toon Disney]]. Songwriter [[Stephen Geyer]] performed the lead vocal and composed the theme song.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Stan Freberg]]): The never-seen narrator welcomes the viewer to \"the Land of Wuz,\" and is heard throughout each episode.\n* '''Bumblelion''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[Bumble bee|bumblebee]] and half [[lion]], Bumblelion is mostly lion in appearance. He is a short, squat orange furred creature with a pink mane, fuzzy [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]], a lion's tail, small [[insect]] wings, and horizontal brown stripes up his tummy. He lives in a [[Beehive (beekeeping)|beehive]], likes sports, is courageous, and has a crush on Butterbear. He is said to be the sort who \"rush[es] in where angels fear to tread\". He and Eleroo are best friends.\n* '''Butterbear''' (voiced by Kathleen Helppie-Shipley): Half [[bear]] and half [[butterfly]], Butterbear is mostly bear in appearance. She has yellow fur with a white tummy, larger wings than the other Wuzzles, and short antennae with flowers on their ends. She is a keen gardener who is gentle and patient despite the crazy adventures of her friends.\n* '''Eleroo''' (voiced by [[Henry Gibson]]): Half [[elephant]] and half [[kangaroo]]. One of the larger Wuzzles, Eleroo is purple, with the body shape and tail of a [[kangaroo]] and an [[elephant]]'s trunk and ears. He has a horizontally striped pouch (despite the fact that pouches are found only on female kangaroos). Eleroo has trouble remembering what he stores in his pouch. He is sweet, but accident-/disaster-prone. He and Bumblelion are best friends.\n* '''Moosel''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[moose]] and half [[Pinniped|seal]], although he also sports flippers like a [[pinniped]]. Moosel, the smallest Wuzzle, is blue and purple. He has a vivid imagination, which makes him believe in monsters. He is the youngest of the Wuzzles. He and Rhinokey are best friends.\n* '''Hoppopotamus''' (voiced by [[Jo Anne Worley]]): Half [[rabbit]], half [[hippopotamus]]. She is called Hoppo by her friends. Hoppo is the largest Wuzzle. She is a hippopotamus with a rabbit's ears, buck teeth and a fluffy tail. She has blue fur with a purple tummy, and she loves to sing and act. Hoppo is a pushy demanding diva, but she can be sweet. However, when toughness is called for (particularly in dealing with the regular villain, Crocosaur), she is the toughest Wuzzle of all. Hoppo has a crush on Bumblelion, but Bumblelion has his heart set on Butterbear.\n* '''Rhinokey''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[rhinoceros]] and half [[monkey]], Rhinokey is mostly monkey in appearance. Rhinokey is a Wuzzle who has a rhino-like snout with a horizontal-stripped horn, pink fur, and rhino-like legs. He is in a posture that is very much like that of a monkey's. Rhinokey is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky prankster. He loves to play practical jokes. He can be obnoxious, but he loves his friends. He and Moosel are best friends.\n* '''Crocosaur''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[crocodile]], half [[dinosaur]], and the main villain of the show. Crocosaur (normally referred to as just '''Croc''' in the series) is bad-tempered, lazy, vile, ignorant, a bully, and does anything to get what he wants. He always wants the best of what the other Wuzzles have, but does not want to apply the effort to acquire it himself.\n** '''Brat''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[wild boar]], half [[European dragon|dragon]], and Crocosaur's chief sidekick. Brat sputters, raspberries, cries, laughs, yells, growls, and grunts in his speech, but Crocosaur always understands what he is saying. Like Crocosaur, he is very lazy and has a strong dislike towards the other Wuzzles coupled with a desire to have the best of what they have without applying any effort towards acquiring it. As his name implies, Brat is very bad-tempered and is often shown throwing tantrums when he does not get his own way. He is also greatly lacking in intelligence, and his incompetence often sees himself and Crocosaur falling victim to their own devices, which in turn occasionally sees the two of them falling out.\n** '''Flizard''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[frog]], half [[lizard]], and Crocosaur's other sidekick. Flizard is not particularly intelligent, but he means well, is more amiable in his manner than either Crocosaur or Brat, and relatively more tolerant of the Wuzzles, but nevertheless very loyal to Crocosaur; on occasions where Crocosaur and Brat fall out, it is often up to Flizard to try and patch things up between them. His character essentially emphasizes tolerance of others whom one is not particularly close to, while staying loyal to one's friends regardless of whether their plans are morally right or not. Flizard does not appear in every episode, only making sporadic appearances throughout the series.\n\n===Minor or one-shot characters===\n* '''Tycoon''' (voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]): Half [[tiger]] and half [[raccoon]]. Tycoon is the rich kid of Wuz. He owns a money tree. He shows the other Wuzzles that he got his wealth from smart investing and saving his money, and teaches them about fiscal responsibility.\n* '''Officer Eaglbeagle''' (voiced by [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]]): Half [[Beagle]], half [[bald eagle]]. He is a no-nonsense cop who appears in the episodes \"In the Money\" and \"Klutz on the Clutch\", both times dealing with illegal behavior from Rhinokey (allegedly robbing a bank and dangerous driving, respectively). His name may be a pun on the phrase \"legal eagle\".\n* '''Mr. Packcat''' (voiced by [[Alan Oppenheimer]]): Half [[packrat]], half [[cat]].\n* '''Mrs. Pedigree''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]): Half [[swan]], half [[ostrich]]. She is a rich, sophisticated Wuzzle who is highly respected in the gang's hometown. She made very brief appearances in the episodes \"In the Money\" and \"Klutz on the Clutch\" before having a major role in \"Class Dismissed\" when she hosted a swanky party at her estate.\n* '''Transylvia''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]): Half [[vulture]], half [[ape]]. She is the [[vampire]]-[[Witchcraft|witch]] of the Terrified Forest. Her name is a pun on [[Transylvania]]. She looks a bit like the [[winged monkeys]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' or the [[Tengu]] of Japanese mythology, travels on a flying \"boomerangstick\" and is proud of the fact that people are scared of her, but seems to have self-confidence issues (until the end of the episode, anyway) and turned out to not be so scary once the gang got to know her (although she dissuaded them from telling anyone).\n** '''The Dingbats''': Transylvia's henchmen, described as \"part [[dingo]], part [[bat]], and ugly all over\" by the Narrator. They do not speak (apart from a few snickers) and seem to be rather incompetent, bringing their mistress Butterbear when she told them to find butterberries.\n** '''The Gorantula''': Half [[gorilla]] and half [[tarantula]]. Transylvia's pet, which was enlarged into an aggressive monster by a miscast spell and drove Transylvia out of her castle. The gang helped her to magically shrink it back to a more manageable size.\n* '''Peter Parafox''' (voiced by [[Brian Cummings]]): Half [[parrot]], half [[fox]] and the owner of Parafox Studios in Hollywuz. He spent most of \"Hooray for Hollywuz\" ordering his Dogrilla (dog-gorilla) security to throw the persistent but unwanted Hoppo out of the studio. He does not seem to be able to say anything without squawking loudly at some point during the sentence.\n** '''Steven Sealbird''': Half [[Pinniped|seal]], half [[seabird]] and another Hollywuz movie director whose film making was interrupted by Hoppo. His name is a parody of movie producer [[Steven Spielberg]].\n\n===Untelevised characters that appeared in books or as plush toys===\n* '''Piggypine''': Half [[pig]] and half [[porcupine]]. She befriends Angela in \"Piggypine's Weighty Problem\".\n* '''Koalakeet''': Half [[koala]] and half [[parakeet]]. He is friends with Colin in \"Koalakeet Saves the Day\".\n* '''Pandeaver''': Half [[Giant panda|panda]] and half [[beaver]]. He is the favorite Wuzzle of Gretchen in \"A Hot Tip for Pandeaver\".\n* '''Woolrus''': Half [[sheep]] and half [[walrus]]. He is friends with Jeanette in \"Woolrus' Sleepy Time Pal\".\n* '''Skowl''': Half [[skunk]] and half [[owl]]. He is the namesake of \"Skowl Fixes Things for Croc\".\n\n===Baby Wuzzles===\nThese characters appeared only as plush toys.\n* '''Kittypen''': Half [[Domestic cat|kitten]] and half [[penguin]].\n* '''Chipadillo''': Half [[chipmunk]] and half [[armadillo]].\n* '''Moofly''': Half [[Cattle|calf]] and half [[dragonfly]].\n* '''Peepsqueak''': Half [[Chicken|chick]] and half [[mouse]].\n* '''Puppling''': Half [[Domestic dog|puppy]] and half [[duck]]ling.\n* '''Foxee''': Half [[fox]] and half [[zebra]].\n\n==Voices==\n* [[Gregg Berger]] \u2013 Tycoon\n* [[Brian Cummings]] \u2013 Bumblelion, Flizard, Peter Parafox, Molecrab\n* [[Stan Freberg]] \u2013 Narrator\n* [[Henry Gibson]] \u2013 Eleroo, Girafbra\n* Kathleen Helppie-Shipley \u2013 Butterbear\n* [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] \u2013 Mrs. Pedigree, Transylvia\n* [[Alan Oppenheimer]] \u2013 Rhinokey, Croc, Mr. Packcat, Pirat Captain\n* [[Will Ryan]] \u2013 Wishing Well\n* [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] \u2013 Moosel, Brat, Officer Eaglbeagle, Dr. P.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book.<ref name=\"Financial-Times\">{{cite news |last1=Ben-Ami |first1=Daniel |title=Free market defined |url=https://www.ft.com/content/519636d2-4298-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |publisher=Financial Times |date=13 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Prospect\">{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Jennifer |title=The Measure of All Things |url=https://prospect.org/article/measure-all-things |accessdate=3 August 2019 |publisher=The American Prospect |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism began after the [[Great Depression]] as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting [[liberalism|liberal]] values of [[individual liberty]] and [[limited government]], which they believed were threatened in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]] by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied?

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Instead, it acted as \"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\" of greater collectivist government intervention \"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|84}} Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the [[New Deal]] and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\", \"combat the forces of [[collectivism]]\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n===Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950\u20131980)===\nJones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|153}} This network would serve \"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|218}} that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist [[Milton Friedman]] becoming its most influential proponent\u2014its \"beating heart\", as Jones describes it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|135}} Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and collectivism into a \"faith in free markets\", often articulating \"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|345,116}} Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \"lost truths\" from [[classical liberalism]], including the value of [[individual liberty]], the [[invisible hand]] of the free market, and the virtues of [[limited government]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101}} By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \"distinct and coherent identity\" centered around \"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|132}} Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism.\n\nJones points to an early essay by [[Milton Friedman]] entitled [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 \"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\"] as a \"bridge\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought\u2014dominated by European conerns\u2014and the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}} Jones considers the essay a \"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self-conscious political and economic concept in the United States\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \"new faith\" between [[collectivism]], which he believed leads to an over-mighty state, and [[laissez-faire]] economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref><ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} However, the essay marked a \"symbolic cutting off point\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \"middle way\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters.

They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].

Together, these strands were called '[[collectivism]]' by neoliberals.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|329}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\n\nThe author divides the history of neoliberalism into three phases.\n\nIn the first phase, lasting from 1920 to 1950, Jones contends that the crises of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Second World War]] produced two competing economic ideologies: [[Keynesianism]] and [[neoliberalism]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|22}} Keynesianism, developed by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and motivated by the widespread [[unemployment]] during the Great Depression, viewed government intervention in the economy as a means to alleviate [[economic downturn]]s and achieve [[full employment]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|24}} Neoliberalism, promoted by economists like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]] and arising out of fears of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes like the [[Nazi]]s, [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet communists]], and [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]], viewed increasing government intervention as a threat to [[economic freedom|economic]] and [[political freedom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|22}} Early neoliberal thought, according to Jones, focused on defending [[liberalism]] and critiquing all forms of [[collectivism]], and in particular on critiquing [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]], which they believed posed a \"grave threat to the continued existence of Western civilization\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|23,136}}\n\nIn the second phase, lasting from 1950 to 1980, Jones notes that Keynesianism dominated political policy while neoliberal thought was mostly confined to universities and [[think tanks]]. However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Hoff]], editor of [[Farmand]], (left) and Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] (middle) at the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947]]\nJones outlines how, after the catastrophes of [[World War II]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] convened a group of intellectuals to combat the trend of increasing government intervention in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] and \"develop an organizational and intellectual strategy\" to \"defend the core tenets of...the freedom of the individual.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30}} This group called itself the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], after the venue of its first meeting in Vevey, Switzerland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ebenstein|first1=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|date=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466886766|page=146}}</ref> The society set out to develop a neoliberal alternative to, on the one hand, the [[laissez-faire]] economic consensus that had collapsed with the [[Great Depression]] and, on the other, [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]], collectivist trends which they believed posed a threat to [[individual freedom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|33}} A distinct neoliberal worldview, Jones contends, emerged \"on the foundations of the critique of New Deal liberalism and social democracy\" developed by the intellectuals of the Society.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones finds three Mont Pelerin individuals particularly influential: [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|33}} Popper, in his book ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', criticized thinkers from [[Plato]] to [[Karl Marx]] for valuing the collective over the individual and derided teleological [[historicism]] (a theory which holds that history unfolds inexorably according to universal laws) as a threat to [[individualism]]\u2014which he believed underpins [[Western civilization]]\u2014because it reduces the individual to \"a cog in the machine\" of history and empowers governments to engage in the sorts of \"Utopian engineering\" that has motivated communists, socialists, and [[Nazis]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|37\u201349}} Mises, in his book ''[[Bureaucracy (book)|Bureaucracy]]'', argued the superiority of the private market motivated by [[profit (economics)|profit]] over the bureaucratic management inherent in government.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|49\u201357}} Hayek, in his book ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', argued effective central planning was impossible because no individual or group could ever possess the requisite knowledge to direct the economic activity of millions of people.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|57\u201373}}\n\nThe early Mont Pelerin Society, Jones notes, had little effect on political policy. Instead, it acted as \"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\" of greater collectivist government intervention \"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|84}} Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the [[New Deal]] and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\", \"combat the forces of [[collectivism]]\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n===Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950\u20131980)===\nJones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|153}} This network would serve \"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|218}} that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist [[Milton Friedman]] becoming its most influential proponent\u2014its \"beating heart\", as Jones describes it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|135}} Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and collectivism into a \"faith in free markets\", often articulating \"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|345,116}} Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \"lost truths\" from [[classical liberalism]], including the value of [[individual liberty]], the [[invisible hand]] of the free market, and the virtues of [[limited government]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101}} By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \"distinct and coherent identity\" centered around \"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|132}} Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism.\n\nJones points to an early essay by [[Milton Friedman]] entitled [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 \"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\"] as a \"bridge\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought\u2014dominated by European conerns\u2014and the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}} Jones considers the essay a \"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self-conscious political and economic concept in the United States\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \"new faith\" between [[collectivism]], which he believed leads to an over-mighty state, and [[laissez-faire]] economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref><ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} However, the essay marked a \"symbolic cutting off point\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \"middle way\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] and more by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by divorcing economic activities from anything unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory of [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan,\" which would usher in neoliberal policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\n===Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)===\n{{Quote box|quote = \"The demise of the postwar economic settlement had been hastened by a series of catastrophic events: the [[Vietnam War]], the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock of 1973]], and the near collapse of [[industrial relations]] in Britain.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters.

It first aired on television in the United States on June 6, 2008. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,673.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[cold open]] reviews some of the events of the previous episode, ''[[Sine Qua Non (Battlestar Galactica)|Sine Qua Non]].'' Text reading \"Two Days Ago\" picks up the story of President [[Laura Roslin]] and the other human beings aboard the damaged [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] [[Cylon Basestar|basestar]]. As the [[Cylon (re-imagining)#Hybrids|Cylon hybrid]] is reconnected, it cries out \"Jump!\" The ship [[Jump drive|jumps]] to an empty part of space.  During the jump, Roslin finds herself aboard a dark, empty ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]].'' Priestess Elosha, who died in the Season 2 two-part episode, ''[[Home (Battlestar Galactica)|Home]],'' appears. She and Roslin embrace. Roslin admits she feels at home aboard the ''Galactica.'' The jump ends, and Roslin's vision ends. During subsequent jumps the vision recurs. Roslin and Elosha walk through the ship, eventually reaching the [[sick bay]] where they see a version of Roslin dying alone of her cancer. Again, the vision ends when the jump ends. The Hybrid continues to jump the basestar, and the [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Leader of the Number Eights]] theorizes that the Hybrid is completing its mission and bringing the basestar to the Hub, so that the resurrection technology of the Cylons can be destroyed. She also determines that the Hybrid detected the death of the Six known as Natalie and panicked, causing her to jump the Basestar. However, due to the Hybrid hooking itself into all of the Basestar's systems, it can no longer be disconnected.\n\n[[Gaius Baltar]], one of the [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Sixes]], and an Eight believe that the Hybrid is panicking. Baltar's attempts to talk to the Hybrid seem to calm it somewhat, but Roslin's attempts to do the same do not. Baltar criticizes Roslin for speaking \"at\" the Hybrid rather than to it. Roslin attempts to calm the Hybrid again, speaking to it more humanely, and the Hybrid seems to calm down even further.\n\nThe jumps continue, as do Roslin's visions during the jumps. Roslin and Elosha discuss death and dying.  The periods between jumps become somewhat lengthy.  During one such period, [[Karl Agathon|Capt. Karl \"Helo\" Agathon]] discusses the mission with the Leader of the Eights.  He and the Eight conclude that only by using the ''Galactica's'' Viper ships\u2014several of which were trapped aboard the basestar when it jumped away from the Colonial Fleet\u2014can they hope to destroy the Hub. They conceive a plan. When Helo shows signs of stress, the Eight massages his shoulders just as his wife, [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon|Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon]] has done. Helo is surprised at her actions, but the Eight reveals that she downloaded many of Athena's memories after Athena used the resurrection ship technology (an event which occurred during the Season 3 episode, ''[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]''). Helo finds himself emotionally drawn to the Eight.\n\nAboard the Hub, the Cylon known as [[Brother Cavil]] \"unboxes\" or reactivates the [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] known as D'Anna Biers. All Number Threes were deactivated and their memories isolated and stored in the third season episode ''Rapture.'' But now Cavil uses the resurrection technology to reactivate Biers.  Cavil reveals that civil war has broken out among the Cylons, with the Eights, Sixes and [[Leoben Conoy|Twos]] opposing the [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Fours]], [[Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)|Fives]] and [[Brother Cavil|Ones]]. Biers is surprised to see [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii|Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii]] having defected to join the Ones. Biers expresses surprise that Cavil does not want to know the identity of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The \"Final Five\" (Numbers Seven, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve) Humanoid Cylons|Final Five Cylons]]. Cavil says his mind has not changed on that subject, and that the identity of the Final Five must remain hidden. He merely wants to know if Biers and the Threes will help end the civil war.\n\nMeanwhile, Roslin continues to communicate with the Hybrid during periods between jumps. Baltar asserts that only he can communicate with it, but Roslin seems able to glean information from it as well. Roslin tries to learn about her dream in which she and Athena run through an opera house in pursuit of the half-human/half-Cylon hybrid child, [[Hera Agathon]], only to have a Six and Baltar pick up the girl and leave through a closed door. Although the Hybrid appears to give Roslin more clues, it quickly senses the re-activation of the Threes. This creates alarm among the humans and Cylons aboard the damaged basestar, infusing them with a sense of urgency though Helo notes it makes their job easier since they no longer have to find D'Anna a body.\n\nDuring another jump, Roslin and Elosha witness [[William Adama|Admiral William Adama]], [[Lee Adama|Lee \"Apollo\" Adama]] who is comforting Capt. Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace, and [[Dr. Cottle]] standing a [[wikt:deathwatch|deathwatch]] over Roslin. Adm. Adama seems very distressed over Roslin's impending death, and Roslin and Elosha discuss what it means to die, and to die alone.\n\nWhen the jump is over, Helo and the Leader of the Eights tell Roslin and the Leader of the Sixes about their plan. The [[Cylon Raider]]s and Cylon Heavy Raiders will attack any basestars around the Hub, and disable the Hub's jump drive. Meanwhile, the Vipers\u2014all electronics and engines turned off in order to avoid detection \u2014 will be towed into battle by several Heavy Raiders. Once they close with the Hub, the Cylons will free the Vipers. The Leader of the Eights and Helo will board the Hub and kidnap the Three. Once they are clear, the Vipers will use [[nuclear weapon]]s to destroy the Hub. After the meeting, President Roslin tells Helo that he must bring the Three to her first so that she can learn the names of the Final Five Cylons hiding among the humans in the Colonial Fleet. She tells him that she must know the names of the Final Five first, and that only the human race can know the way to Earth. Helo disagrees, arguing this is a betrayal of the trust they have built with the Cylons. Roslin tells him that he must put aside his feelings for the Eights and follow orders, or she will remove him from the mission. Helo agrees to do as she asks.\n\nRoslin continues to try to talk to the Hybrid. The Hybrid's vocalizations soon lead the Cylons and humans to realize that the Number Six model known as [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Natalie Faust|Natalie]] is either wounded or dying back aboard the ''Galactica.'' This leads to murmurs of distrust among the Cylons.\n\nHelo and the Leader of the Eights discuss the Viper towing plan with the Cylon and human pilots. Many of the human pilots express dismay, arguing that their ships will be defenseless before the Cylons. [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#Eammon \"Gonzo\" Pike|Lt. Eammon \"Gonzo\" Pike]] in particular is vocal about his anger and distrust of the plan. His complaints lead to several rejoinders by the Cylon pilots, especially the Sixes. But the Eight and Helo point out that the Cylon pilots will be fighting and dying as well. The Eight points out that there is no alternative plan, and that if the plan succeeds then the human pilots will have destroyed Cylon resurrection technology forever. This appeases the disgruntled pilots, human and Cylon.\n\nThe damaged basestar jumps to the Hub's location. Once more, Roslin has a vision during the jump. Still at her own deathbed, she and Elosha talk more about death. Elosha says that everyone values their life, even bad people like Baltar. Life is too precious for any one person to decide whether to take another's life, she counsels Roslin.  Roslin has difficulty believing her. Elosha says that is because Roslin has not allowed herself to feel in a long time, nor to love. Roslin watches Adama weep over her dead body, and her face softens.\n\nAfter the jump, battle ensues. On board the hub, Biers takes the opportunity to kill Brother Cavil, and Boomer flees. Helo and the Leader of the Eights board the Hub and leave with Biers. The Viper pilots are freed on cue, and destroy the Hub with nuclear missiles once Helo, the Leader of the Eights and D'Anna are safely away.  Also, one of the two enemy Basestars is destroyed in the Hub's explosion accounting for the destroyed Basestar detected in the previous episode. During the battle, Baltar encounters a [[Cylon (reimagining)#Current Model|Centurion]]. He begins to speak to the Centurion, telling it about his beliefs in a Cylon God, the seeming enslavement of the Centurions by the [[Cylon (reimagining)#Humanoid Cylons|humanoid models]], and the need for the Centurions to take control. As the Centurion seems to become angry, a weapon strikes the Cylon basestar. The Centurion is destroyed in the explosion, and Baltar is wounded in the stomach (bleeding heavily).\n\nRoslin discovers Baltar in the damaged corridor, and drags him to safety in another room.  She puts a [[Field dressing (bandage)|field dressing]] on his belly wound, and injects him with [[morphine]] for the pain.  As Baltar becomes less lucid due to the drug, he tells Roslin that he carried an incredible guilt which the Cylon [[monotheism|monotheistic]] god has taken away from him.  An incredulous and shaken Roslin listens as Baltar tells her that he gave the Cylons the defense codes which led to the [[genocide]] against the human race. Baltar justifies his actions by saying that the book of [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#Pythia|Pythia]] tells of a [[Noah|Noachic flood]] which reinvigorated the human race. No one blamed the flood, Baltar says; likewise, he is just a flood, and no one should blame him. As Baltar slips toward unconsciousness, Roslin removes his field dressing. Baltar begins to bleed to death. Out in space in the battle, Lt. Pike declares that he is not going to put his faith in the Cylons any more, and that he has programmed his Raptor to jump repeatedly until it reaches the Fleet again. Seelix, who is nearby in a Viper, tells him not to flee. An enemy Cylon Raider attacks his ship, and a bullet pierces the front window of his ship, mortally wounding him.  Pike manages to jump his ship (the results of his jump are seen in the previous episode, ''Sine Qua Non''). The rebel Cylons and humans land about the damaged basestar, and it jumps to safety shortly thereafter.\n\nDuring the jump away from the Hub, Roslin is deeply moved to see herself die. Adama weeps as Roslin's life ends.  He says he will no longer be selfish and fight to keep her alive. As he prays that she finds true rest, he removes his wedding ring and puts it on Roslin's finger.\n\nThe jump ends. Helo takes Biers to see Roslin. The Eight tries to stop him, telling him that this is a violation of their trust and the pact the Cylons had with the human beings. But Helo tells her that he's \"just following orders,\" and leaves with the Three.\n\nRoslin finds herself across the room from Baltar. Realizing she may have ended his life, she rushes to put a new field dressing on his wound, and attaches an [[Intravenous therapy|I.V. bag]] of fluids to his arm to help him overcome shock. Helo and Biers arrive. Biers rushes to Baltar's side, and finds that he is still alive.  She announces he will live, and Roslin is relieved.\n\nRoslin orders Helo to leave them alone, and she asks Biers for the identities of the Final Five.  Biers declares that Roslin is herself a Cylon. Roslin is shocked, but then the Three bursts out laughing. She says that was a lie, and that she has no intention of revealing the identities of the Final Five until the basestar reaches the Fleet and safety.\n\nThe basestar jumps back to the position the Colonial Fleet had occupied before its jump at the end of the previous episode, ''Sine Qua Non.''  William Adama, reading in his [[Colonial Raptor]] and waiting for the basestar's return, quickly powers up his ship and flies toward the basestar. He and Roslin greet one another on the basestar's flight deck. They embrace, and Roslin tells him that she loves him. Adama responds that it's \"about time\".\n\n==Deleted scenes==\nThere are several deleted scenes for this episode. One featured the Rebel Basestar facing Cylon boarders when Helo, D'Anna and the Eight return. In this scene, the Eight Helo has been working with is killed by a Cavil boarder right after her confrontation with Helo. The Cavil is then killed by Helo who is distressed to realize that the Eight is dead. In the series, this particular Eight never appears again with no reason given.\n\n==Reception==\nAlan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' praised Mary McDonnell's performance and was intrigued by Helo's uneasy interactions with the Eight who had downloaded Athena's memories.

It first aired on television in the United States on June 6, 2008. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,673.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[cold open]] reviews some of the events of the previous episode, ''[[Sine Qua Non (Battlestar Galactica)|Sine Qua Non]].'' Text reading \"Two Days Ago\" picks up the story of President [[Laura Roslin]] and the other human beings aboard the damaged [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] [[Cylon Basestar|basestar]]. As the [[Cylon (re-imagining)#Hybrids|Cylon hybrid]] is reconnected, it cries out \"Jump!\" The ship [[Jump drive|jumps]] to an empty part of space.  During the jump, Roslin finds herself aboard a dark, empty ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]].'' Priestess Elosha, who died in the Season 2 two-part episode, ''[[Home (Battlestar Galactica)|Home]],'' appears. She and Roslin embrace. Roslin admits she feels at home aboard the ''Galactica.'' The jump ends, and Roslin's vision ends. During subsequent jumps the vision recurs. Roslin and Elosha walk through the ship, eventually reaching the [[sick bay]] where they see a version of Roslin dying alone of her cancer. Again, the vision ends when the jump ends. The Hybrid continues to jump the basestar, and the [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Leader of the Number Eights]] theorizes that the Hybrid is completing its mission and bringing the basestar to the Hub, so that the resurrection technology of the Cylons can be destroyed. She also determines that the Hybrid detected the death of the Six known as Natalie and panicked, causing her to jump the Basestar. However, due to the Hybrid hooking itself into all of the Basestar's systems, it can no longer be disconnected.\n\n[[Gaius Baltar]], one of the [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Sixes]], and an Eight believe that the Hybrid is panicking. Baltar's attempts to talk to the Hybrid seem to calm it somewhat, but Roslin's attempts to do the same do not. Baltar criticizes Roslin for speaking \"at\" the Hybrid rather than to it. Roslin attempts to calm the Hybrid again, speaking to it more humanely, and the Hybrid seems to calm down even further.\n\nThe jumps continue, as do Roslin's visions during the jumps. Roslin and Elosha discuss death and dying.  The periods between jumps become somewhat lengthy.  During one such period, [[Karl Agathon|Capt. Karl \"Helo\" Agathon]] discusses the mission with the Leader of the Eights.  He and the Eight conclude that only by using the ''Galactica's'' Viper ships\u2014several of which were trapped aboard the basestar when it jumped away from the Colonial Fleet\u2014can they hope to destroy the Hub. They conceive a plan. When Helo shows signs of stress, the Eight massages his shoulders just as his wife, [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon|Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon]] has done. Helo is surprised at her actions, but the Eight reveals that she downloaded many of Athena's memories after Athena used the resurrection ship technology (an event which occurred during the Season 3 episode, ''[[Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)|Rapture]]''). Helo finds himself emotionally drawn to the Eight.\n\nAboard the Hub, the Cylon known as [[Brother Cavil]] \"unboxes\" or reactivates the [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] known as D'Anna Biers. All Number Threes were deactivated and their memories isolated and stored in the third season episode ''Rapture.'' But now Cavil uses the resurrection technology to reactivate Biers.  Cavil reveals that civil war has broken out among the Cylons, with the Eights, Sixes and [[Leoben Conoy|Twos]] opposing the [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Fours]], [[Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)|Fives]] and [[Brother Cavil|Ones]]. Biers is surprised to see [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii|Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii]] having defected to join the Ones. Biers expresses surprise that Cavil does not want to know the identity of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The \"Final Five\" (Numbers Seven, Nine, Ten, Eleven, Twelve) Humanoid Cylons|Final Five Cylons]]. Cavil says his mind has not changed on that subject, and that the identity of the Final Five must remain hidden. He merely wants to know if Biers and the Threes will help end the civil war.\n\nMeanwhile, Roslin continues to communicate with the Hybrid during periods between jumps. Baltar asserts that only he can communicate with it, but Roslin seems able to glean information from it as well. Roslin tries to learn about her dream in which she and Athena run through an opera house in pursuit of the half-human/half-Cylon hybrid child, [[Hera Agathon]], only to have a Six and Baltar pick up the girl and leave through a closed door. Although the Hybrid appears to give Roslin more clues, it quickly senses the re-activation of the Threes. This creates alarm among the humans and Cylons aboard the damaged basestar, infusing them with a sense of urgency though Helo notes it makes their job easier since they no longer have to find D'Anna a body.\n\nDuring another jump, Roslin and Elosha witness [[William Adama|Admiral William Adama]], [[Lee Adama|Lee \"Apollo\" Adama]] who is comforting Capt. Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace, and [[Dr. Cottle]] standing a [[wikt:deathwatch|deathwatch]] over Roslin. Adm. Adama seems very distressed over Roslin's impending death, and Roslin and Elosha discuss what it means to die, and to die alone.\n\nWhen the jump is over, Helo and the Leader of the Eights tell Roslin and the Leader of the Sixes about their plan. The [[Cylon Raider]]s and Cylon Heavy Raiders will attack any basestars around the Hub, and disable the Hub's jump drive. Meanwhile, the Vipers\u2014all electronics and engines turned off in order to avoid detection \u2014 will be towed into battle by several Heavy Raiders. Once they close with the Hub, the Cylons will free the Vipers. The Leader of the Eights and Helo will board the Hub and kidnap the Three. Once they are clear, the Vipers will use [[nuclear weapon]]s to destroy the Hub. After the meeting, President Roslin tells Helo that he must bring the Three to her first so that she can learn the names of the Final Five Cylons hiding among the humans in the Colonial Fleet. She tells him that she must know the names of the Final Five first, and that only the human race can know the way to Earth. Helo disagrees, arguing this is a betrayal of the trust they have built with the Cylons. Roslin tells him that he must put aside his feelings for the Eights and follow orders, or she will remove him from the mission. Helo agrees to do as she asks.\n\nRoslin continues to try to talk to the Hybrid. The Hybrid's vocalizations soon lead the Cylons and humans to realize that the Number Six model known as [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Natalie Faust|Natalie]] is either wounded or dying back aboard the ''Galactica.'' This leads to murmurs of distrust among the Cylons.\n\nHelo and the Leader of the Eights discuss the Viper towing plan with the Cylon and human pilots. Many of the human pilots express dismay, arguing that their ships will be defenseless before the Cylons. [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#Eammon \"Gonzo\" Pike|Lt. Eammon \"Gonzo\" Pike]] in particular is vocal about his anger and distrust of the plan. His complaints lead to several rejoinders by the Cylon pilots, especially the Sixes. But the Eight and Helo point out that the Cylon pilots will be fighting and dying as well. The Eight points out that there is no alternative plan, and that if the plan succeeds then the human pilots will have destroyed Cylon resurrection technology forever. This appeases the disgruntled pilots, human and Cylon.\n\nThe damaged basestar jumps to the Hub's location. Once more, Roslin has a vision during the jump. Still at her own deathbed, she and Elosha talk more about death. Elosha says that everyone values their life, even bad people like Baltar. Life is too precious for any one person to decide whether to take another's life, she counsels Roslin.  Roslin has difficulty believing her. Elosha says that is because Roslin has not allowed herself to feel in a long time, nor to love. Roslin watches Adama weep over her dead body, and her face softens.\n\nAfter the jump, battle ensues. On board the hub, Biers takes the opportunity to kill Brother Cavil, and Boomer flees. Helo and the Leader of the Eights board the Hub and leave with Biers. The Viper pilots are freed on cue, and destroy the Hub with nuclear missiles once Helo, the Leader of the Eights and D'Anna are safely away.  Also, one of the two enemy Basestars is destroyed in the Hub's explosion accounting for the destroyed Basestar detected in the previous episode. During the battle, Baltar encounters a [[Cylon (reimagining)#Current Model|Centurion]]. He begins to speak to the Centurion, telling it about his beliefs in a Cylon God, the seeming enslavement of the Centurions by the [[Cylon (reimagining)#Humanoid Cylons|humanoid models]], and the need for the Centurions to take control. As the Centurion seems to become angry, a weapon strikes the Cylon basestar. The Centurion is destroyed in the explosion, and Baltar is wounded in the stomach (bleeding heavily).\n\nRoslin discovers Baltar in the damaged corridor, and drags him to safety in another room.  She puts a [[Field dressing (bandage)|field dressing]] on his belly wound, and injects him with [[morphine]] for the pain.  As Baltar becomes less lucid due to the drug, he tells Roslin that he carried an incredible guilt which the Cylon [[monotheism|monotheistic]] god has taken away from him.  An incredulous and shaken Roslin listens as Baltar tells her that he gave the Cylons the defense codes which led to the [[genocide]] against the human race. Baltar justifies his actions by saying that the book of [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#Pythia|Pythia]] tells of a [[Noah|Noachic flood]] which reinvigorated the human race. No one blamed the flood, Baltar says; likewise, he is just a flood, and no one should blame him. As Baltar slips toward unconsciousness, Roslin removes his field dressing. Baltar begins to bleed to death. Out in space in the battle, Lt. Pike declares that he is not going to put his faith in the Cylons any more, and that he has programmed his Raptor to jump repeatedly until it reaches the Fleet again. Seelix, who is nearby in a Viper, tells him not to flee. An enemy Cylon Raider attacks his ship, and a bullet pierces the front window of his ship, mortally wounding him.  Pike manages to jump his ship (the results of his jump are seen in the previous episode, ''Sine Qua Non''). The rebel Cylons and humans land about the damaged basestar, and it jumps to safety shortly thereafter.\n\nDuring the jump away from the Hub, Roslin is deeply moved to see herself die. Adama weeps as Roslin's life ends.  He says he will no longer be selfish and fight to keep her alive. As he prays that she finds true rest, he removes his wedding ring and puts it on Roslin's finger.\n\nThe jump ends. Helo takes Biers to see Roslin. The Eight tries to stop him, telling him that this is a violation of their trust and the pact the Cylons had with the human beings. But Helo tells her that he's \"just following orders,\" and leaves with the Three.\n\nRoslin finds herself across the room from Baltar. Realizing she may have ended his life, she rushes to put a new field dressing on his wound, and attaches an [[Intravenous therapy|I.V. bag]] of fluids to his arm to help him overcome shock. Helo and Biers arrive. Biers rushes to Baltar's side, and finds that he is still alive.  She announces he will live, and Roslin is relieved.\n\nRoslin orders Helo to leave them alone, and she asks Biers for the identities of the Final Five.  Biers declares that Roslin is herself a Cylon.
