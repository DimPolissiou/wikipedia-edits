Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Archdiocese of St. Louis]].\n\nAlready having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as [[St. Louis University High School]]). In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus. Not long after that, it received its charter as a university by an act of the Missouri Legislature.<ref name=\"University of Saint Louis\"/> In 1829 it moved to Washington Avenue and Ninth at the site of today's [[America's Center]] by the [[Edward Jones Dome]]. In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of a viciously anti-Catholic novel, ''The Mysteries of St. Louis'', written by newspaper editor [[Henry Boernstein]] whose famous paper, the ''[[Anzeiger des Westens]]'' was also a foe of the university.<ref name=McGreevy>''Catholicism and American Freedom,'', [[John McGreevy]] Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\nIn 1867 after the [[American Civil War]] the University purchased \"Lindell's Grove\" to be the site of its current campus.<ref>The University's main campus is named \"Frost Campus\" in honor of General [[Daniel M. Frost]], commander of the Missouri Militia during the Camp Jackson Incident. After being exchanged for a captured Federal officer, General Frost \"went south\" and was commissioned as a General in the Confederate Army. The University named the campus after General Frost at the request of his daughter Mrs. Harriet Frost Fordyce, who contributed $1,000,000 to the University, allowing a major expansion in 1962. [http://www.slu.edu/sluhistory/scene20.html Frost Campus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219082921/http://www.slu.edu/sluhistory/scene20.html |date=2011-12-19 }} Ironically, part of the Frost Campus covers the former \"Camp Jackson\" militia encampment site.</ref> Lindell's Grove was the site of the [[American civil war|Civil War]] \"[[Camp Jackson Affair]].\" On May 10, 1861, U.S. Regulars and Federally enrolled Missouri Volunteers arrested the [[Missouri State Militia (pre-Missouri State Guard)|Missouri Volunteer Militia]] after the militia received a secret shipment of siege artillery, infantry weapons, and ammunition from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Government. While the Militia was arrested without violence, angry local citizens rushed to the site, and rioting broke out, in which 28 people were killed. The Camp Jackson Affair lead to open conflict within the state, culminating with a successful Federal offensive in mid-June 1861, which expelled the state's pro-secession governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson]] from the state capitol ([[Jefferson City]]). Jackson later led a Missouri Confederate government-in-exile, dying of cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1862.\n\nThe first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889. [[St. Francis Xavier College Church]] moved to its current location with the completion of the lower church in 1884.

The sophomore residency requirement caused controversy when initiated in the 2009\u201310 school year, as the University lacked adequate housing to house all sophomores and upper-level students who requested on-campus housing. In the 2010\u201311 school year, the school announced the transfer of the Student Housing Scholarship (of $1,000 to $2,000) to the Tuition Scholarship, which made off-campus housing more affordable and pursued by upperclassmen. Two new residence halls, Spring Hall and Grand Hall, were completed recently, adding capacity for nearly 1,000 additional students<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slu.edu/news/home/res-halls-july.php|title=New Residence Halls|website=www.slu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206163837/https://www.slu.edu/news/home/res-halls-july.php|archive-date=December 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and creating a new dining hall, classroom space and other assets.\n\n====Freshman Year Experience options====\n[[File:SLU Village Apartments.jpg|thumb|280px|Student village on-campus apartments]]\nGrand Hall, completed in 2017, and Spring Hall, completed in 2016, are both occupied by first-year and second-year students at SLU.

Gries is in the heart of the campus, in front of the quad, and has an average freshman living space, 10' 7.5\" by 18' 2\", with community showers and bathrooms. Reinert Hall, named after Jesuit Father Paul C. Reinert, is two blocks south of the main campus in a converted [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott]] hotel.  Where the building lacks in location, it makes up for in living space, containing some of the largest dormitories across the country, 12' 1\" by 27', complete with private full baths in each room, though each room houses three to four roommates.\n\n====Upperclass options====\n[[File:Flats at 374.jpg|thumb|280px|Flats, junior and senior apartments]]\nSeveral housing choices exist for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. DeMattias Hall acts as a Greek dormitory and de facto community House. Next to DeMattias Hall is Marguerite Hall, which offers eight floors of suite-style two-occupancy dorm rooms. \n\nGrand Forest, the Village, and the Marchetti Towers are the on-campus apartment options available for upper-level students. The Marchetti Towers are just west of Grand Forest and consists of two, 12-story towers. During the summer of 2008, Marchetti Towers underwent a $3.8 million renovation.\n\n==Major building and renovation projects==\nDuring the past 20 years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis. Some of the highlights of three decades at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in enhancements and expansions including the major expansion of the [[Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business]]; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to [[Parks College of Engineering, Aviation, and Technology]]; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center. Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave. (between Lindell Blvd. and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall. Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A.

Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis|Archdiocese of St. Louis]].\n\nAlready having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as [[St. Louis University High School]]). In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus. Not long after that, it received its charter as a university by an act of the Missouri Legislature.<ref name=\"University of Saint Louis\"/> In 1829 it moved to Washington Avenue and Ninth at the site of today's [[America's Center]] by the [[Edward Jones Dome]]. In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of a viciously anti-Catholic novel, ''The Mysteries of St. Louis'', written by newspaper editor [[Henry Boernstein]] whose famous paper, the ''[[Anzeiger des Westens]]'' was also a foe of the university.<ref name=McGreevy>''Catholicism and American Freedom,'', [[John McGreevy]] Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\nIn 1867 after the [[American Civil War]] the University purchased \"Lindell's Grove\" to be the site of its current campus.<ref>The University's main campus is named \"Frost Campus\" in honor of General [[Daniel M. Frost]], commander of the Missouri Militia during the Camp Jackson Incident. After being exchanged for a captured Federal officer, General Frost \"went south\" and was commissioned as a General in the Confederate Army. The University named the campus after General Frost at the request of his daughter Mrs. Harriet Frost Fordyce, who contributed $1,000,000 to the University, allowing a major expansion in 1962. [http://www.slu.edu/sluhistory/scene20.html Frost Campus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219082921/http://www.slu.edu/sluhistory/scene20.html |date=2011-12-19 }} Ironically, part of the Frost Campus covers the former \"Camp Jackson\" militia encampment site.</ref> Lindell's Grove was the site of the [[American civil war|Civil War]] \"[[Camp Jackson Affair]].\" On May 10, 1861, U.S. Regulars and Federally enrolled Missouri Volunteers arrested the [[Missouri State Militia (pre-Missouri State Guard)|Missouri Volunteer Militia]] after the militia received a secret shipment of siege artillery, infantry weapons, and ammunition from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Government. While the Militia was arrested without violence, angry local citizens rushed to the site, and rioting broke out, in which 28 people were killed. The Camp Jackson Affair lead to open conflict within the state, culminating with a successful Federal offensive in mid-June 1861, which expelled the state's pro-secession governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson]] from the state capitol ([[Jefferson City]]). Jackson later led a Missouri Confederate government-in-exile, dying of cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1862.\n\nThe first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889. [[St. Francis Xavier College Church]] moved to its current location with the completion of the lower church in 1884.

In 2011 the clock tower was dedicated to a prominent alumnus of Saint Louis University, Joseph G. Lipic, and was renamed the Joseph G. Lipic Clock Tower Plaza.<ref>Hasamear, J. (2011, June 9).

The sophomore residency requirement caused controversy when initiated in the 2009\u201310 school year, as the University lacked adequate housing to house all sophomores and upper-level students who requested on-campus housing. In the 2010\u201311 school year, the school announced the transfer of the Student Housing Scholarship (of $1,000 to $2,000) to the Tuition Scholarship, which made off-campus housing more affordable and pursued by upperclassmen. Two new residence halls, Spring Hall and Grand Hall, were completed recently, adding capacity for nearly 1,000 additional students<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.slu.edu/news/home/res-halls-july.php|title=New Residence Halls|website=www.slu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206163837/https://www.slu.edu/news/home/res-halls-july.php|archive-date=December 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and creating a new dining hall, classroom space and other assets.\n\n====Freshman Year Experience options====\n[[File:SLU Village Apartments.jpg|thumb|280px|Student village on-campus apartments]]\nGrand Hall, completed in 2017, and Spring Hall, completed in 2016, are both occupied by first-year and second-year students at SLU.

Gries is in the heart of the campus, in front of the quad, and has an average freshman living space, 10' 7.5\" by 18' 2\", with community showers and bathrooms. Reinert Hall, named after Jesuit Father Paul C. Reinert, is two blocks south of the main campus in a converted [[Marriott Hotels & Resorts|Marriott]] hotel.  Where the building lacks in location, it makes up for in living space, containing some of the largest dormitories across the country, 12' 1\" by 27', complete with private full baths in each room, though each room houses three to four roommates.\n\n====Upperclass options====\n[[File:Flats at 374.jpg|thumb|280px|Flats, junior and senior apartments]]\nSeveral housing choices exist for sophomores, juniors, and seniors. DeMattias Hall acts as a Greek dormitory and de facto community House. Next to DeMattias Hall is Marguerite Hall, which offers eight floors of suite-style two-occupancy dorm rooms. \n\nGrand Forest, the Village, and the Marchetti Towers are the on-campus apartment options available for upper-level students. The Marchetti Towers are just west of Grand Forest and consists of two, 12-story towers. During the summer of 2008, Marchetti Towers underwent a $3.8 million renovation.\n\n==Major building and renovation projects==\nDuring the past 20 years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis. Some of the highlights of three decades at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in enhancements and expansions including the major expansion of the [[Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business]]; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to [[Parks College of Engineering, Aviation, and Technology]]; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center. Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave. (between Lindell Blvd. and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall. Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center in 2007 and the on-campus [[Chaifetz Arena]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slu.edu/x5504.xml|title=Biography of Lawrence Biondi, S.J.|publisher=Saint Louis University|access-date=2008-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617112500/http://www.slu.edu/x5504.xml|archive-date=2008-06-17|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Edward A.

The film stars [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Charlotte Rampling]], [[Harriet Walter]], [[Billy Howle]], [[Emily Mortimer]] and [[Michelle Dockery]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]] on 2 January 2017.

He receives a letter from the estate of Sarah Ford, the mother of his 1960s university girlfriend Veronica. To his surprise she has left him \u00a3500 and a diary, which is still with Veronica.\n\nIn flashback, we see that Tony's Sixth Form classmate, Robson, died from what many believed to be suicide after his girlfriend became pregnant. Drawing on French existentialist philosophy, Tony and his three best friends, one of them the highly intelligent Adrian Finn, conclude that Robson died for the wrong reasons. Later, at the [[University of Bristol]], Tony met Veronica, who introduced him to photography as a hobby. On a visit to her family, Veronica's attractive mother Sarah flirted with him but warned him about Veronica's true nature.  As Tony left, Sarah gave him a horizontal wave at waist level. Tony was unsure if was a flirtatious goodbye or a warning signal. \n\nVeronica later broke up with Tony, having never had full sexual intercourse with him. He received a letter from Adrian requesting his blessing for his new relationship with Veronica. At first he decided to respond positively, but then wrote an angry reply, writing of her being damaged and how even her mother had warned him about her, and wishing they would have a child which would pay for its parents' sins. He never heard back from either of them. Tony's two best friends from Sixth Form later informed him that Adrian, who had seemed happy and in love at first, had committed suicide. Tony believed that Veronica could have met Adrian through her brother Jack, who like Adrian studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] (but had previously told Tony he did not know Adrian), but they pointed out that Adrian and Veronica met through Tony.\n\nIn the present day, Adrian tells his ex-wife Margaret about his relationship with Veronica for the first time. Tony reconnects with his two Sixth Form friends and they help him locate Veronica online. She is still angry at him, has burned the diary, which might have explained why Adrian committed suicide, but hands him the angry letter he wrote to her and Adrian. Spying on Veronica, Tony sees her with an [[intellectually disabled]] middle-aged man who bears a striking resemblance to, and is called, Adrian. Tony learns that Adrian Jr. is not Veronica's son but her younger half-brother, and guesses he is the son of Adrian Sr and Sarah.\n\nTony's daughter Susie, whose pregnancy has been a subplot throughout the film, gives birth to a healthy boy. Tony writes to Veronica, apologising to her for what he did.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jim Broadbent]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline>{{cite news|last1=Jaafar|first1=Ali|title=Charlotte Rampling, Harriet Walter, Emily Mortimer and Michelle Dockery Board \u2018The Sense Of An Ending\u2019|url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/the-sense-of-an-ending-charlotte-rampling-harriet-walter-emily-mortimer-michelle-dockery-jim-broadbent-downton-abbey-1201494142/|accessdate=7 August 2015|magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=6 August 2015}}</ref> as Anthony 'Tony' Webster\n** [[Billy Howle]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Young Tony Webster\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Veronica Ford\n** [[Freya Mavor]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Young Veronica Ford\n* [[Joe Alwyn]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Adrian Finn Sr.\n* Andrew Buckley as Adrian Finn Jr.\n* Peter Wight as Colin Simpson\n** Jack Loxton as Young Colin Simpson\n* Hilton McRae as Alex Stuart\n** Timothy Innes as Young Alex Stuart\n* [[Harriet Walter]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Margaret, Tony's ex-wife\n* [[Emily Mortimer]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Sarah Ford, Veronica's mother\n* [[Michelle Dockery]]<ref name=Aug2015Deadline/> as Susie Webster, Tony\u2019s daughter\n* [[Matthew Goode]] as Mr. Joe Hunt, Tony's history teacher\n* [[Edward Holcroft]] as Jack Ford, Veronica\u2019s brother\n* [[James Wilby]] as David Ford, Veronica\u2019s father\n\n== Production ==\nOn 8 February 2015, it was announced that [[Ritesh Batra]] would next direct a drama for Origin Pictures and [[BBC Films]], based on the [[Julian Barnes]]' novel ''[[The Sense of an Ending]]'', and scripted by [[Nick Payne]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Macnab|first1=Geoffrey|title=Lunchbox director Ritesh Batra in talks to adapt The Sense of An Ending|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/berlin/news/lunchbox-director-in-talks-for-next-film/5082915.article|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=screendaily.com|date=8 February 2015}}</ref> On 11 May 2015, [[Jim Broadbent]] was cast in the film for the lead role, which BBC Films and [[FilmNation Entertainment]] would be financing, and FilmNation also handling the international sales.<ref name=May2015THR>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana|last2=McClintock|first2=Pamela|title=Cannes: Jim Broadbent to Star in 'The Sense of an Ending' (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-jim-broadbent-star-sense-794680|accessdate=7 August 2015|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=11 May 2015}}</ref> [[David M.

At the election he was endorsed by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and [[Komeito]] and received more than 2.11 million votes,<ref name=yahoo/> more than double his nearest opponent in the seven-candidate race. He replaced [[Naoki Inose]], who had resigned in the second year of his four-year term due to a political funds scandal.\n\nIn May 2016 reports surfaced concerning Masuzoe's misuse of public funds, including the use of his chauffeur-driven government car to travel to and from his holiday house on most weekends. As examination into his spending continued, it was found that he had misused funds to purchase items for personal use, including art, comics, and meals, as well as paying for his family to stay in hotels that were accounted as meeting-related expenses. An independent investigation ultimately determined that he had acted inappropriately but not illegally. Despite this, surveys showed that more than 90% of Tokyo residents were dissatisfied with how he handled the issue and the lack of a clear explanation.\n\nAs pressure grew on Masuzoe to resign, a no-confidence motion jointly submitted by all of the parties represented in the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly]] was to be put to a vote on the afternoon of 15 June. As the motion was likely to pass and wanting to avoid further disruption to the governing of the city, Masuzoe submitted his resignation to assembly President [[Shigeo Kawai]] on the morning of the 15th, to become effective as of 21 June.<ref name=yahoo/>\n\n==Candidates==\nA total of 21 candidates were nominated for the election.<ref name=campaign>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/14/national/politics-diplomacy/campaign-kicks-off-tokyo-governor-race/ |title=Campaign kicks off for Tokyo governor race |work=Japan Times |last=Aoki |first=Mizuho |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref> [[Yuriko Koike]], a former [[Minister of Defence (Japan)|Minister of Defence]] and incumbent member for the [[Tokyo 10th district]] in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], announced her candidacy despite not receiving an endorsement from the Liberal Democratic Party.<ref name=campaign/> Instead, the LDP (along with Komeito and the [[Party for Japanese Kokoro]]) endorsed [[Hiroya Masuda]], who is a former [[Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications]] and former governor of [[Iwate Prefecture]].<ref name=campaign/><ref name=noms>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/11/national/politics-diplomacy/ldps-masuda-gets-official-tokyo-gubernatorial-nod-former-commentator-koga-weighs-dp-bid/ |title=LDP\u2019s Masuda gets official Tokyo gubernatorial nod as former commentator Koga weighs DP bid |last1=Aoki |first1=Mizuho |last2=Osumi |first2=Magdalena |work=Japan Times |date=11 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Junichi Ishida]] was approached by the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016)|Democratic Party]] but ultimately declined to run.<ref name=noms/> Ultimately, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties (including the [[Japanese Communist Party|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic]] parties) endorsed veteran journalist [[Shuntaro Torigoe]].<ref name=campaign/> [[Kenji Utsunomiya]], former head of the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]] and a candidate in the two previous gubernatorial elections, announced his intention to run on 11 July but withdrew two days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/13/national/politics-diplomacy/tokyo-gubernatorial-candidates-name-nurseries-school-fees-cancer-key-issues/ |title=Utsunomiya withdraws from Tokyo gubernatorial race to boost opposition-supported Torigoe |work=Japan Times |last=Osaki |first=Tomohiro |date=13 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Guardian'' stated that the election \"has piqued interest not only because of the size of the task which falls to its victor, but also for the mud slinging and misogyny which has characterised the fight between the candidates.\" Former Tokyo governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] made disparaging remarks regarding Koike's age and use of makeup, and characterized Torigoe as a \"traitor to his country\" for questioning Japanese protection of the [[Senkaku Islands]].

At the election he was endorsed by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and [[Komeito]] and received more than 2.11 million votes,<ref name=yahoo/> more than double his nearest opponent in the seven-candidate race. He replaced [[Naoki Inose]], who had resigned in the second year of his four-year term due to a political funds scandal.\n\nIn May 2016 reports surfaced concerning Masuzoe's misuse of public funds, including the use of his chauffeur-driven government car to travel to and from his holiday house on most weekends. As examination into his spending continued, it was found that he had misused funds to purchase items for personal use, including art, comics, and meals, as well as paying for his family to stay in hotels that were accounted as meeting-related expenses. An independent investigation ultimately determined that he had acted inappropriately but not illegally. Despite this, surveys showed that more than 90% of Tokyo residents were dissatisfied with how he handled the issue and the lack of a clear explanation.\n\nAs pressure grew on Masuzoe to resign, a no-confidence motion jointly submitted by all of the parties represented in the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly]] was to be put to a vote on the afternoon of 15 June. As the motion was likely to pass and wanting to avoid further disruption to the governing of the city, Masuzoe submitted his resignation to assembly President [[Shigeo Kawai]] on the morning of the 15th, to become effective as of 21 June.<ref name=yahoo/>\n\n==Candidates==\nA total of 21 candidates were nominated for the election.<ref name=campaign>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/14/national/politics-diplomacy/campaign-kicks-off-tokyo-governor-race/ |title=Campaign kicks off for Tokyo governor race |work=Japan Times |last=Aoki |first=Mizuho |date=14 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref> [[Yuriko Koike]], a former [[Minister of Defence (Japan)|Minister of Defence]] and incumbent member for the [[Tokyo 10th district]] in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]], announced her candidacy despite not receiving an endorsement from the Liberal Democratic Party.<ref name=campaign/> Instead, the LDP (along with Komeito and the [[Party for Japanese Kokoro]]) endorsed [[Hiroya Masuda]], who is a former [[Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications]] and former governor of [[Iwate Prefecture]].<ref name=campaign/><ref name=noms>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/11/national/politics-diplomacy/ldps-masuda-gets-official-tokyo-gubernatorial-nod-former-commentator-koga-weighs-dp-bid/ |title=LDP\u2019s Masuda gets official Tokyo gubernatorial nod as former commentator Koga weighs DP bid |last1=Aoki |first1=Mizuho |last2=Osumi |first2=Magdalena |work=Japan Times |date=11 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Junichi Ishida]] was approached by the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 2016)|Democratic Party]] but ultimately declined to run.<ref name=noms/> Ultimately, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties (including the [[Japanese Communist Party|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic]] parties) endorsed veteran journalist [[Shuntaro Torigoe]].<ref name=campaign/> [[Kenji Utsunomiya]], former head of the [[Japan Federation of Bar Associations]] and a candidate in the two previous gubernatorial elections, announced his intention to run on 11 July but withdrew two days later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/13/national/politics-diplomacy/tokyo-gubernatorial-candidates-name-nurseries-school-fees-cancer-key-issues/ |title=Utsunomiya withdraws from Tokyo gubernatorial race to boost opposition-supported Torigoe |work=Japan Times |last=Osaki |first=Tomohiro |date=13 July 2016 |access-date=15 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Guardian'' stated that the election \"has piqued interest not only because of the size of the task which falls to its victor, but also for the mud slinging and misogyny which has characterised the fight between the candidates.\" Former Tokyo governor [[Shintaro Ishihara]] made disparaging remarks regarding Koike's age and use of makeup, and characterized Torigoe as a \"traitor to his country\" for questioning Japanese protection of the [[Senkaku Islands]].

The captain of ''Atlantis'', [[Bernhard Rogge]], sent the documents to his superiors who gave a summary to the Japanese. Historians have speculated that the knowledge of the weak British defences in Asia may have emboldened the Japanese to invade Singapore and played a part in the development of the war in the Pacific.\n\nIn 1944, Mohr published an account of the raiding career of ''Atlantis'' titled ''Die Kriegsfahrt Des Hilfskreuzers Atlantis'', and in 1955 he published ''Atlantis: The story of the German surface raider'' in conjunction with [[Arthur Sellwood]].\n\n==Early life==\nUlrich Mohr's father was an officer in the German navy.

HOUR-LONG EPISODES ARE CONSIDERED TWO EPISODES. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE EPISODE NUMBERS IN THIS ARTICLE. -->\n\"'''Stress Relief'''\" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episodes of the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]], and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.\n\nIn this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's [[fire safety]] skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a [[Roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an [[Copyright infringement|illegally downloaded]] movie at work starring [[Jack Black]], [[Jessica Alba]] and [[Cloris Leachman]], and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim temporarily.\n\nBoth parts of \"Stress Relief\" originally aired together on February 1, 2009 immediately following NBC's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]], and ''The Office'' writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. Guest stars Black, Alba and Leachman do not interact with the regular characters themselves, but rather appear in a film within the episode. ''The Office'' creator [[Greg Daniels]] said this was done to keep the episode more grounded in reality.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declaring it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. The episode is considered a favorite by many fans of the series. Many commentators particularly praised the chaotic [[cold open]] scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers with a simulated fire as part of a twisted safety demonstration. Because it aired following the Super Bowl, \"Stress Relief\" was the most viewed episode of ''The Office'' with 22.9 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]] during its original broadcast. It won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], and received another nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Part one===\nAnnoyed that none of his co-workers paid attention to the fire safety seminar he gave last week, [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by [[Dunder Mifflin]] [[CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.\n\nWith tensions running high in the office, Michael tries to calm his workers down with [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] sessions. However, Michael soon realizes ''he'' is actually the source of his employees' stress when Stanley\u2019s stress reader beeps uncontrollably whenever Michael is nearby. Michael hands the stress reader to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and is horrified when the same result occurs. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly|Pam]]\u2019s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage, and Pam\u2019s father is staying with her and [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]). Jim attempts to cheer Pam up by watching a pirated movie titled ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' with [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) (they do not know how to access such films while Andy does, so they have to watch the movie in Andy's company). The film stars [[Jack Black]], who is engaged to a character played by [[Jessica Alba]], but falls in love with her elderly grandmother, played by [[Cloris Leachman]]. During the movie, Jim and Pam discuss the situation with Pam\u2019s parents, but Andy believes their comments are directed at the characters in the film, leading him to conclude they are \"movie geniuses\" finding hidden depths in the film.\n\n===Part two===\nMichael decides the workers are stressed because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a [[roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each of the office and warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. When Michael roasts Stanley, saying \"Stanley, you crush your wife during sex, and your heart sucks.\", Stanley laughs heartily, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.\n\nPam asks Jim to talk to her father and convince him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates.

HOUR-LONG EPISODES ARE CONSIDERED TWO EPISODES. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE EPISODE NUMBERS IN THIS ARTICLE. -->\n\"'''Stress Relief'''\" is a two-part episode of the American comedy television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. They constituted the fourteenth and fifteenth episodes of the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]], and the 86th and 87th overall episodes of the series. Both episodes were directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.\n\nIn this episode, Dwight stages a fire in the office to test the office's [[fire safety]] skills, but things go from bad to worse when Stanley suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], causing Michael to come up with ways to relieve stress in the office, including a [[Roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself. Meanwhile, Andy, Jim, and Pam watch an [[Copyright infringement|illegally downloaded]] movie at work starring [[Jack Black]], [[Jessica Alba]] and [[Cloris Leachman]], and Pam deals with her parents' recent argument that's caused her father to move in with her and Jim temporarily.\n\nBoth parts of \"Stress Relief\" originally aired together on February 1, 2009 immediately following NBC's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIII]], and ''The Office'' writers and producers sought to attract newcomers to the series with the expected increase in viewership. Guest stars Black, Alba and Leachman do not interact with the regular characters themselves, but rather appear in a film within the episode. ''The Office'' creator [[Greg Daniels]] said this was done to keep the episode more grounded in reality.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine declaring it the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. The episode is considered a favorite by many fans of the series. Many commentators particularly praised the chaotic [[cold open]] scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers with a simulated fire as part of a twisted safety demonstration. Because it aired following the Super Bowl, \"Stress Relief\" was the most viewed episode of ''The Office'' with 22.9 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]] during its original broadcast. It won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]], and received another nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Part one===\nAnnoyed that none of his co-workers paid attention to the fire safety seminar he gave last week, [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by [[Dunder Mifflin]] [[CFO]] [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] ([[Andy Buckley]]), and [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.\n\nWith tensions running high in the office, Michael tries to calm his workers down with [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] sessions. However, Michael soon realizes ''he'' is actually the source of his employees' stress when Stanley\u2019s stress reader beeps uncontrollably whenever Michael is nearby. Michael hands the stress reader to [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) and is horrified when the same result occurs. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly|Pam]]\u2019s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage, and Pam\u2019s father is staying with her and [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]). Jim attempts to cheer Pam up by watching a pirated movie titled ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' with [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) (they do not know how to access such films while Andy does, so they have to watch the movie in Andy's company). The film stars [[Jack Black]], who is engaged to a character played by [[Jessica Alba]], but falls in love with her elderly grandmother, played by [[Cloris Leachman]]. During the movie, Jim and Pam discuss the situation with Pam\u2019s parents, but Andy believes their comments are directed at the characters in the film, leading him to conclude they are \"movie geniuses\" finding hidden depths in the film.\n\n===Part two===\nMichael decides the workers are stressed because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a [[roast (comedy)|comedic roast]] of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each of the office and warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. When Michael roasts Stanley, saying \"Stanley, you crush your wife during sex, and your heart sucks.\", Stanley laughs heartily, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.\n\nPam asks Jim to talk to her father and convince him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.\n\nIn the final scene of the episode, the ending of the illegally downloaded movie is revealed: Jack Black visits Cloris Leachman with flowers and a new walker, only to discover her affair with another young man and he walks away heartbroken.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:PaulLieberstein.jpg|thumb|right |200 px|''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' actor and producer [[Paul Lieberstein]] wrote \"Stress Relief\"]]\n\n\"Stress Relief\" was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]] and written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who also plays [[Toby Flenderson]] on the show.

Sepinwall said \"Stress Relief\" was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He said the only drawback of the episode was the ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday'' subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars.<ref name=\"Sepinwall\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, \"This was one of my favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through.\" Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called \"a very satisfying ending to the roast saga\". He called the Black/Leachman romance \"creepy and hilarious\", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode.<ref name=\"TVGuide\" />\n\nDavid Krone of the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'' said although he had mixed feelings about the fifth season so far, he found \"Stress Relief\" to be \"one of the season's best efforts\". Krone specifically praised the Jim and Pam subplot and Dwight's character, adding, \"It's a pretty perfect way to unwind \u2013 or, if your team lost, to become reanimated \u2013 after the Super Bowl.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Krone |first=David |title=A super-fun night at 'The Office' |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=February 1, 2009 |page=L1}}</ref> Rick Ingebritson of ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'' said the episode \"was funny from start to finish\", particularly praising Dwight Schrute's role and the Michael Scott roast. However, Ingebritson said he was disgusted by the Leachman nude scene from ''Mrs. Albert Hannaday''.<ref name=\"PalmPost\" /> [[Will Leitch]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, said the episode was funny, but \"curiously unfocused [like] two half-hour episodes awkwardly spliced together. He praised the Black/Leachman film, the trouble Dwight kept getting in, and the Jim and Pam subplot, which he called \"a rare Pam-Jim plot point that worked\". However, he called the Michael roast \"yet another Michael-wanting-to-be-loved-and-still-be-the-Boss subplot that takes over the second half\".<ref name=\"Leitch\" />\n\nNot all reviews were positive. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Whitney Pastorek said the episode started strong with the fire scare scene, but \"tapered off into a disjointed plot\" that she felt would not win new viewers. She said many jokes went too long and lost momentum, but nevertheless wrote \"a lot of the episode\u2019s humor was engaging and smart\".<ref name=\"EW\" /> Lorenzo Perez of ''[[The News & Observer]]'' said the Pam subplot was \"overworked\" and lacked impact, and the Dwight character was over-the-top, proving ''The Office'' writers clearly have no idea how to rein in Dwight Schrute. Perez also expressed doubt the show would attract a new audience because it ran too late into the night following the Super Bowl. However, Perez said he enjoyed the Black/Leachman cameos.<ref name=\"Perez\" /> Terry Morrow of the ''[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]'' said, \"This particular visit to ''The Office'' doesn't pop like most episodes\". Morrow praised the Black/Leachman film, but said, \"To be upstaged by a B-plot, one not involving the show's main characters at all, is a bit of a misdirection the show doesn't need in a post-Super Bowl time slot.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrow |first=Terry |title='The Office' fumbles its postgame show |work=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]] |date=January 30, 2009 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/398156_tvoffice31.html |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' critic Robert Bianco said the plot was extremely thin and the Black and Leachman cameos were humorless and grotesque.
