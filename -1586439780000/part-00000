Thank you.-->\n\n'''Blond''' or '''fair hair''' is a [[Human hair color|hair color]] characterized by low levels of the dark [[pigment]] [[eumelanin]]. The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.''

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders. The two forms, however, are pronounced identically. [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'s ''Book of English Usage'' propounds that, insofar as \"a blonde\" can be used to describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term is an example of a \"[[sexism|sexist]] stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.\"<ref name=\"AHBEU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/002.html |title=5.

The masculine version is used in the plural, in \"blonds of the European race\",<ref name=OED1992/> in a citation from 1833 ''Penny cyclopedia'', which distinguishes genuine blondness as a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] feature distinct from [[albinism]].<ref>''Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', s.v. Albinos. Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain, 1833).</ref>\n\nBy the early 1990s, \"blonde moment\" or being a \"dumb blonde\" had come into common parlance to mean \"an instance of a person, esp. a woman... being foolish or scatter-brained.\"<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50023771 \"blonde, blond, a. and n.\"] ''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

The ''OED'' gives \"brunet\" as meaning \"dark-complexioned\" or a \"dark-complexioned person\", citing a comparative usage of ''brunet'' and ''blond'' to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in saying, \"The present contrast of blonds and brunets existed among them.\"<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50028357 \"brunet, a. and n.\"] ''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE. The earliest known individual with the derived allele is the ANE [[Afontova Gora]] 3 individual, dated to 14,700 years ago.<ref>Mathieson et al., ''The Genomic History Of Southeastern Europe'', bioRxiv,  (19 September 2017), {{doi|10.1101/135616}} ''Nature'' vol. 555,  197\u2013203 (8 March 2018), {{doi|10.1038/nature25778}}.</ref>\nAncient DNA of ANE or \"steppe\" ancestry is found in Mesolithic Northern Europe.\n\nIt is possible that blond hair evolved more than once.

Babies may be born with blond hair even among groups where adults rarely have blond hair, although such natural hair usually falls out quickly. Blond hair tends to turn darker with age, and many children's blond hair turns light, medium, dark brown or black before or during their adult years.<ref name=Ridley/> Because blond hair tends to turn brown with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood;{{sfn|Davies|2011|page=73}}{{sfn|Russell-Cole|Wilson|Hall|2013|page=52}} according to the sociologist [[Christie Davies]], only around five percent of adults in Europe and North America are naturally blond.{{sfn|Davies|2011|page=73}} A study conducted in 2003 concluded that only four percent of American adults are naturally blond.{{sfn|Russell-Cole|Wilson|Hall|2013|page=52}} A significant majority of Caucasian women (perhaps as high as three in four){{clarify|reason=of those who dye their hair?

The pigmentation of both hair and eyes is lightest around the Baltic Sea, and darkness increases regularly and almost concentrically around this region.<ref>Cavalli-Sforza, L., Menozzi, P. and Piazza, A. (1994). ''The History and Geography of Human Genes''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.{{page?|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[France]], according to a source published 1939, blondism is more common in [[Normandy]], and less common in the [[Pyrenees]] and the Mediterranean seacoast; 26% of French population has blond or light brown hair.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coon |first=Carleton S. |title=The Races of Europe |quote=France as a whole finds but 4 per cent of black and near-black hair color, 23 per cent of dark brown, 43 per cent of medium brown, 14 per cent of light brown, 12 per cent of various degrees of blond, and some 4 per cent of reddish-brown and red. (...) <br /> The regional distribution of hair color in France follows closely that of stature. Although the position of the French in regard to hair pigmentation is intermediate between blond and black, the diagonal line from [[Mont St. Michel]] to [[Orleans]], [[Lyons]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] border divides the country into a northeastern quadrant, in which the hair is somewhat lighter than medium, and a southwestern, in which it is somewhat darker. High ratios of black and very dark brown hair are found not in the typically Alpine country, but along the slope of the Pyrenees, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking country, and on the Mediterranean seacoast. Blond hair is commonest along the [[English Channel|Channel]], in regions settled by [[Saxons]] and [[Normans]], in [[Burgundy]] and the country bordering [[Switzerland]], and down the course of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]]. In northern France it seems to follow upstream the rivers which empty into the Channel. The hair color of the departments occupied by [[Flemish]] speakers, and of others directly across the Channel from England in Normandy, seems to be nearly as light as that in the southern English counties; the coastal cantons of [[Brittany]] are lighter than the inland ones, and approximate a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] condition. In the same way, the northeastern French departments are probably as light-haired as some of the provinces of southern Germany.}}</ref> A 2007 study of French females showed that by then roughly 20% were blonde, although half of these blondes were fully fake.

The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\".

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders.

[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'s ''Book of English Usage'' propounds that, insofar as \"a blonde\" can be used to describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term is an example of a \"[[sexism|sexist]] stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.\"<ref name=\"AHBEU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/002.html |title=5.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

Although the position of the French in regard to hair pigmentation is intermediate between blond and black, the diagonal line from [[Mont St. Michel]] to [[Orleans]], [[Lyons]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] border divides the country into a northeastern quadrant, in which the hair is somewhat lighter than medium, and a southwestern, in which it is somewhat darker. High ratios of black and very dark brown hair are found not in the typically Alpine country, but along the slope of the Pyrenees, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking country, and on the Mediterranean seacoast. Blond hair is commonest along the [[English Channel|Channel]], in regions settled by [[Saxons]] and [[Normans]], in [[Burgundy]] and the country bordering [[Switzerland]], and down the course of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]]. In northern France it seems to follow upstream the rivers which empty into the Channel. The hair color of the departments occupied by [[Flemish]] speakers, and of others directly across the Channel from England in Normandy, seems to be nearly as light as that in the southern English counties; the coastal cantons of [[Brittany]] are lighter than the inland ones, and approximate a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] condition.

{"title_page": "Izikhothane", "text_new": "{{short description|South African competition to determine which party is wealthier.}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Izikhothane''' (Ukukhothana) refers to [[South Africa]]n [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] or dance battles in which individuals or groups of individuals compete against each other in front of large crowds to determine which party is wealthier. These 'battles' are performed using material items such as money, mobile phones, clothes, alcohol or foods. In most instances a battle is won by the intentional destruction or wastage of one's own expensive items to demonstrate the lack of concern for such material possessions due to the ability to afford more of the same. A competitor's chances of victory are improved by having items that are more expensive than those of their opponent it can be money or clothes. Some of the Izikhothanes are from [[Botswana]] (Super Mosha).\n\n== Origin ==\nThe word \"Izikhothane\" is a slang word that originates from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"Osikhotheni\". Osikhotheni means people who live in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word \"Isikhotha\" that means \"bush\". The singular form of this Zulu word is called \"usikhotheni\". This term is township slang for [[Con man|hustlers]] who live a lavish lifestyle (nice expensive clothes etc.) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish lifestyles.\n\nIzikhothane originated in the early 2000s in the South African townships of [[City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan]] previously known as the Eastrand, but mainly started in [[Katlehong]], one of the townships in Eastrand. The act remained largely unnoticed until it gained popularity in 2011 and 2012. A similar trend called uSwenka existed in South Africa in the 1950s where [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] and labourers dressed themselves in their finest suits and shoes to compete in contests.<ref name=mg1/> The winner of these contests would win money, household necessities or livestock, which they would send back home to their families.\n\n== Practices ==\nThe Izikhothane are usually from impoverished backgrounds and spend beyond their financial means to purchase high-end [[Designer clothing|designer apparel]], prestige branded alcohol, luxury food items, and expensive accessories including jewellery and mobile phones. These items are then destroyed or disposed of in an attempt to create a perception of opulence and thereby gain social status.\n\nIn [[Eastern cape]] this culture is mostly joined at 11 to 18 years old. The purpose of the culture is to impress and making your [[clan]] famous. The members make battles of showing off tags and dancing with other groups to make themselves famous. In [[Port Elizabeth|P.E.]] the culture mostly includes music in it. The members end up dissing each others in terms of challenging. In Eastern Cape a Clan called Innocent Squad is the most famous and Skeem Seh Njabulo, in [[Jeffreys Bay]] is Smart Fellaz. Hankey got the elderly clan called Mpolo Trend. The members get money in different ways. Eastern cape got the mostly talented clans for example Innocent Squad (also known as Obhuti abamsulwa) is one of the clan with its own recording studio (Omthina fam). As the Producer and the member of the clan meets Young Talents Int, he said \"I am very glad to be in my clan. My wish is us to be the example of our fellow clans. Grow and glow.Be wise,stop wasting and save for the future\" said Blessing Brighter mostly known as Jostar. In other ways community don't support this culture but it never stopped. In Eastern Cape, Carvela is mostly worn in terms of showing you afford. They always show themselves in Public places for attention and makes Saturday a big day for them.\n\nThe ability to afford expensive clothing is fundamental to Izikhothane and one's reputation is determined by this expression. The Izikhothane sometimes demonstrate this by buying two pairs of the same high-end brand of shoe in different colours and then wearing one shoe of each colour to indicate that two pairs of the same expensive shoe can be afforded.<ref name=star1/> Another tactic in battle is to wear expensive clothing in layers and then destroy one layer at a time thereby destroying more clothes than the opponent. Price tags are sometimes retained on the clothing so that competitors can flaunt the cost of their items.\n\nSome of the greatest legends are Thapelo Sello (Sisto Di Boto), King Mosha, Cvk, Don Dada, Fearless Mosha,Mandana,Mavesta. etc.\n\n== Battles ==\nThe aim of the dance battle is to show more abundance than your opponents as this determines the winner of the battle. There is no tangible reward for winning an Izikhothane battle, just the recognition and affection from the audience that witnesses the battle.\n\nIzikhothane battles occur predominantly across South Africa's townships. The act or battle is performed in a public place such as a park or any open space so that large crowds may gather to witness the event.\n\nCompetitors are predominantly males aged between 12 and 25 years. The popularity of Izikhothane has also started to attract female youth {Material.Mix and Material.Prix). Izikhothane groups compete against each other in inter- or intra-township battles. A group's identity and reputation is upheld by its members' wasteful extravagance.\n\nTo perform in an Izikhothane battle, a contestant must purchase expensive items such as clothing, shoes, alcohol and exorbitant accessories. Loud, colourful, branded items are a necessity. The more a competitor's gear costs, the more dominant they are able to be in the battle. Once at the battle venue, the contestant calls out an opponent. Thereafter these two competitors dance around, showing off their expensive material items to each other and to the crowd. To win the battle, a contestant may be required to destroy their items such as tearing up cash notes, burning or tearing up their designer branded clothing, pouring out expensive alcohol onto the ground and Custured or submerging their mobile phones in water.<ref name=star1/> The champions are decided by the crowd whereby the crowd cheers for the Izikhothane that impressed them the most with their abundance of wealth as depicted by the destruction of their high-value items.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Competitive altruism]]\n* [[Koha (custom)|Koha]], a similar concept among the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]\n* [[Moka exchange]], a similar concept in [[Papua New Guinea]]\n* [[Potlatch]]\n* [[Potluck]]\n* [[Pow wow]], a gathering whose name is derived from the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] word for \"spiritual leader\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=mg1>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/print/2011-10-28-burn-after-wearing-township-kids-hottest-fashion-statement/|title=Burn after wearing \u2013 township kids' hottest fashion statement|author=Nkosi, Sibongile|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=Mail & Guardian|publisher=M&G Online}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=star1>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-bling-1.1343682/|title=Burning Bling|author=Unknown|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/burning-with-a-destructive-desire-1.1465938/|title=Burning with a destructive desire|author=Wende, Hamilton|date=7 February 2013|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Star Newspaper|publisher=Independent Online}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403/|title=Youths destroy pricey togs in show-off challenges|author=Ndabeni, Khanyi|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=The Herald|publisher=Times Media Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204021635/http://www.peherald.com/news/article/6403|archive-date=4 December 2013|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|title=Brash bling and ghetto fabulous|author=Unknown|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024064533/http://www.citypress.co.za/lifestyle/brash-bling-and-ghetto-fabulous-20121006/|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|title='Izikhothane' tear up R100 notes \u2013 report|author=Unknown|date=13 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2013|work=City Press Newspaper|publisher=City Press Online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106081319/http://www.citypress.co.za/news/izikhothane-tear-up-r100-notes-report-20121113/|archive-date=6 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{facebook.com|izikhothane|Izikothane (official)}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWEcV_Ecfl4 Izikothane on 3rd Degree \u2013 Part 1], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsnhbRM7P4 Part 2], and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O97BOeLVI5o Part 3]\u2014YouTube videos of current affairs investigative journalism on eNCA news channel\n\n[[Category:South African culture]]\n[[Category:South African English]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|South African competition to determine which party is wealthier.}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n{{Orphan|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Izikhothane''' (Ukukhothana) refers to [[South Africa]]n [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] or dance battles in which individuals or groups of individuals compete against each other in front of large crowds to determine which party is wealthier. These 'battles' are performed using material items such as money, mobile phones, clothes, alcohol or foods. In most instances a battle is won by the intentional destruction or wastage of one's own expensive items to demonstrate the lack of concern for such material possessions due to the ability to afford more of the same. A competitor's chances of victory are improved by having items that are more expensive than those of their opponent it can be money or clothes. Some of the Izikhothanes are from [[Botswana]] (Super Mosha).\n\n== Origin ==\nThe word \"Izikhothane\" is a slang word that originates from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"Osikhotheni\". Osikhotheni means people who live in the bushes/bundus, and that is derived from the Zulu word \"Isikhotha\" that means \"bush\". The singular form of this Zulu word is called \"usikhotheni\". This term is township slang for [[Con man|hustlers]] who live a lavish lifestyle (nice expensive clothes etc.) without having a job or owning a business. You can call them modernised beggars who live by using illegal ways to satisfy their hunger for their lavish lifestyles.\n\nIzikhothane originated in the early 2000s in the South African townships of [[City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality|Ekurhuleni Metropolitan]] previously known as the Eastrand, but mainly started in [[Katlehong]], one of the townships in Eastrand. The act remained largely unnoticed until it gained popularity in 2011 and 2012. A similar trend called uSwenka existed in South Africa in the 1950s where [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] and labourers dressed themselves in their finest suits and shoes to compete in contests.<ref name=mg1/> The winner of these contests would win money, household necessities or livestock, which they would send back home to their families.\n\n== Practices ==\nThe Izikhothane are usually from impoverished backgrounds and spend beyond their financial means to purchase high-end [[Designer clothing|designer apparel]], prestige branded alcohol, luxury food items, and expensive accessories including jewellery and mobile phones. These items are then destroyed or disposed of in an attempt to create a perception of opulence and thereby gain social status.\n\nIn [[Eastern cape]] this culture is mostly joined at 11 to 18 years old. The purpose of the culture is to impress and making your [[clan]] famous. The members make battles of showing off tags and dancing with other groups to make themselves famous. In [[Port Elizabeth|P.E.]] the culture mostly includes music in it. The members end up dissing each others in terms of challenging. In Eastern Cape a Clan called Innocent Squad is the most famous and Skeem Seh Njabulo, in [[Jeffreys Bay]] is Smart Fellaz. Hankey got the elderly clan called Mpolo Trend. The members get money in different ways.
