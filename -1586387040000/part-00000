She was also a nightclub entertainer and a singer, and one of the early [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmates]]. She was a major Hollywood sex symbol during the 1950s and early 1960s while under contract at [[20th Century Fox]]. She was also known for her well-publicized personal life and publicity stunts, such as \"[[Wardrobe malfunction|wardrobe malfunctions]]\".\n\nMansfield's film career was short-lived, but she had several box-office successes and won a [[Theatre World Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]]. She enjoyed success in the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955\u20131956 [[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Broadway version]] and the 1957 film version of ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' Her other major movie performances were in ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956), ''[[The Wayward Bus (film)|The Wayward Bus]]'' (1957), and ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960). She became the first major American actress in a Hollywood film to have a nude scene in ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'' (1963).\n\nMansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public-relations professional Paul Mansfield. She was married and divorced three times and had five children. She allegedly was intimately involved with numerous men, including [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] and [[John F. Kennedy]], her attorney Samuel S. Brody, and Las Vegas entertainer [[Nelson Sardelli]]. \n\n==Early life and education==\nJayne Mansfield was born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19, 1933, in [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/th-anniversary-of-jayne-mansfield-s-death/article_48f9fb5c-71fa-503a-820a-97e2f1af3d0c.html|title=50th anniversary of Jayne Mansfield's death|last=Koltnow|first=Bo|website=WFMZ.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> She was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904\u20131936), who was of German and English ancestry, and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903\u20132000), of English origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Strait|1992|p=10}}</ref> She inherited more than $90,000 from her maternal grandfather Thomas (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|90000|1958|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} and more than $36,000 from her maternal grandmother, Beatrice Mary Palmer, in 1958 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|36000|1958|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=starnews1958/><ref>{{cite news |title=Jayne Mansfield to get $90,000 |work=[[The Beaver County Times]] |date=January 23, 1957 |page=15}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Vera Jeffrey's father, Thomas H.

April 19, 1933 \u2013 June 29, 1967) was an American film, theater, and television actress. She was also a nightclub entertainer and a singer, and one of the early [[Playboy Playmate|''Playboy'' Playmates]]. She was a major Hollywood sex symbol during the 1950s and early 1960s while under contract at [[20th Century Fox]]. She was also known for her well-publicized personal life and publicity stunts, such as \"[[Wardrobe malfunction|wardrobe malfunctions]]\".\n\nMansfield's film career was short-lived, but she had several box-office successes and won a [[Theatre World Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]]. She enjoyed success in the role of fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955\u20131956 [[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (play)|Broadway version]] and the 1957 film version of ''[[Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?]]'' Her other major movie performances were in ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956), ''[[The Wayward Bus (film)|The Wayward Bus]]'' (1957), and ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960). She became the first major American actress in a Hollywood film to have a nude scene in ''[[Promises! Promises!]]'' (1963).\n\nMansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public-relations professional Paul Mansfield. She was married and divorced three times and had five children. She allegedly was intimately involved with numerous men, including [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert]] and [[John F. Kennedy]], her attorney Samuel S. Brody, and Las Vegas entertainer [[Nelson Sardelli]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJayne Mansfield was born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19, 1933, in [[Phillipsburg, New Jersey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/th-anniversary-of-jayne-mansfield-s-death/article_48f9fb5c-71fa-503a-820a-97e2f1af3d0c.html|title=50th anniversary of Jayne Mansfield's death|last=Koltnow|first=Bo|website=WFMZ.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> She was the only child of Herbert William Palmer (1904\u20131936), who was of German and English ancestry, and Vera Jeffrey Palmer (1903\u20132000), of English origin.<ref>{{harvnb|Strait|1992|p=10}}</ref> She inherited more than $90,000 from her maternal grandfather Thomas (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|90000|1958|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} and more than $36,000 from her maternal grandmother, Beatrice Mary Palmer, in 1958 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|36000|1958|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=starnews1958/><ref>{{cite news |title=Jayne Mansfield to get $90,000 |work=[[The Beaver County Times]] |date=January 23, 1957 |page=15}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Vera Jeffrey's father, Thomas H.

She received first billing above the title but appeared in only a supporting role. The Olympic Games-based film was shot in Greece in the fall of 1960 but was not released until June 1962. It was a box-office failure, and 20th Century-Fox dropped Mansfield's contract.\n\nIn 1961, Mansfield signed on for a minor role but above-the-title billing in ''[[The George Raft Story (film)|The George Raft Story]]''. Starring [[Ray Danton]] as Raft, the film showcased Mansfield in a small part as a glamorous film star. Soon after the film's release, she returned to European films, appearing in low-budget foreign films such as ''[[Heimweh nach St. Pauli]]'' (1963, Germany), ''[[L'Amore Primitivo]]'' (1964, Italy), ''[[Panic Button (1964 film)|Panic Button]]'' (1964, Italy) and ''[[Einer frisst den anderen]]'' (1964, Germany).\n\n[[Tommy Noonan]] persuaded Mansfield to become the first mainstream American actress to appear nude in a starring role, in the film ''[[Promises!

She turned down the role because of her pregnancy with daughter [[Mariska Hargitay]], and was replaced by [[Kim Novak]].

It was released briefly in 1966, but did not enjoy a full release until 1968, almost a year after her death.\n\nAfter ''Single Room Furnished'' wrapped, Mansfield was cast opposite [[Mamie Van Doren]] and [[Ferlin Husky]] in ''[[The Las Vegas Hillbillys]]'' (1966), a low-budget comedy from [[Woolner Brothers]]. It was her first [[country and western]] film, and she promoted it through a 29-day tour of major U.S. cities, accompanied by Husky, [[Don Bowman (singer)|Don Bowman]] and other country musicians. Before filming began, Mansfield said she would not \"share any screen time with the drive-in's answer to Marilyn Monroe\", meaning Van Doren.
