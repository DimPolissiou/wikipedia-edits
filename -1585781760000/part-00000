Eighteen teams contested the competition, with [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] winning their tenth national title.\n\n==Match fixing attempt==\nBefore the league fixture in [[Ljubljana]] between [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911)|Olimpija Ljubljana]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] on November 17, 1969, Sarajevo's goalkeeper [[Refik Mufti\u0107]] reported to the authorities a bribery attempt by a man unknown to him who reportedly wanted him to throw the match in return for 2,000 Yugoslav new dinars. On advice from the police and club officials, and as part of the sting, Mufti\u0107 took the money and also took his place between the posts. Sarajevo ended up winning 4-1 that day while Mufti\u0107 had to leave the match early due to colliding with Olimpija player [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]].

On advice from the police and club officials, and as part of the sting, Mufti\u0107 took the money and also took his place between the posts.

Feature Animation]] and directed by [[Brad Bird]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. It is based on the 1968 novel ''[[The Iron Man (novel)|The Iron Man]]'' by [[Ted Hughes]] (which was published in the United States as ''The Iron Giant'') and was scripted by [[Tim McCanlies]] from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of [[Vin Diesel]] (voicing the titular character), [[Eli Marienthal]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Christopher McDonald]] and [[John Mahoney]]. Set during the [[Cold War]] in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a gigantic metallic robot who fell from outer space. With the help of a [[beatnik]] artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a [[Musical film|musical]] with the involvement of [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]], though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using [[traditional animation]], with [[computer-generated imagery]] used to animate the titular character and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. [[Michael Kamen]] composed the film's score, which was performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic]].\n\n''The Iron Giant'' premiered at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999 and was released worldwide on August 6. Upon release, the film significantly under-performed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $48 million, which was due to Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' in the preceding year. Despite this, the film received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed at the story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine [[Annie Awards]] out of 15 nominations. Through [[home video]] releases and television syndication, the film gathered a [[cult following]] and is now widely regarded as a modern animated classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|title=Duncan Studios Adds New \u2018Iron Giant\u2019 Scenes for Remastered Re-release|quote=Brad Bird\u2019s 1999 '''animated classic''' ''The Iron Giant''...|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Terry|last= Flores}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|title='The Iron Giant,' a modern classic of animation returns: Indie & art house films|publisher=[[OregonLive.com]]|quote=Released in 1999, this '''modern classic''' of hand-drawn animation|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Jamie S. |last=Rich}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|quote=is now widely recognized as a '''modern classic'''|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006043238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|archive-date=2015-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2015, an extended, [[remaster]]ed version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nDuring the [[Cold War]], shortly after the [[Soviet Union]] launched ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, 11-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a 100-foot tall alien [[robot]] attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the scene, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books chronicling the adventures of [[Superman]].\n\nThe incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the [[Korean War]]), and rents a room in their house to keep watch on him. Hogarth evades Kent and moves the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain \"death\" after witnessing hunters killing a deer.\n\nThat night, Hogarth is interrogated by Kent when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending the Giant is one of his art pieces. Angered by the apparent false alarm, Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Kent for his antics. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system and Dean orders it away for Hogarth's safety with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\n\nThe Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Kent jabbers wildly at Rogard to return to Rockwell when he spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell; the Army attacks the Giant after he had picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking Hogarth is dead and the military are responsible, transforms into a war machine in a fit of grief and retaliates, forcing its way back to Rockwell. Kent then convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove ineffective. Hogarth then wakes up and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down when Kent impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will destroy everyone upon impact. Kent attempts to escape, but the Giant stops him and Rogard has him arrested for his actions. In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words \"You are who you choose to be\", smiles contentedly and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population and the military forces nearby but seemingly at the cost of the Giant himself, leaving Hogarth devastated.\n\nMonths later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell and Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langj\u00f6kull]] glacier in [[Iceland]], and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n[[File:Iron Giant, LA Animation Festival, Christopher McDonald, Brad Bird, Eli Marienthol.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher McDonald]], [[Brad Bird]] and [[Eli Marienthal]] in March 2012 at the ''Iron Giant'' screening at the LA Animation Festival]]                                                                 \n\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Hogarth Hughes (named for illustrator Burne Hogarth), an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination.

Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"<ref name=\"awm99\"/> A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to [[Maine]], where they photographed and videotaped five small cities. They hoped to accurately reflect its culture down to the minutiae; \"we shot store fronts, barns, forests, homes, home interiors, diners, every detail we could, including the bark on trees,\" said production designer Mark Whiting.<ref name=\"aa99.3\"/>\n\nBird stuck to elaborate scene planning, such as detailed [[animatics]], to make sure there were no budgetary concerns.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> The team initially worked with [[Macromedia]]'s [[Adobe Director|Director]] software, before switching to [[Adobe After Effects]] full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team\u2014dubbed \"Macro\" early on\u2014to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that \"We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources.\"<ref name=\"awm98\">{{cite news|title=Director and After Effects: Storyboarding Innovations on The Iron Giant|author-link=Brad Bird|first=Brad|last=Bird|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|date=November 1998|issue=3.8|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8birdmacromedia.html|access-date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film.<ref name=\"aa99.1\"/> Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.<ref name=\"birdint09\"/>\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created.<ref name=\"lat99\"/><ref name=\"aa99.2\"/> The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using [[computer-generated imagery]] due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner.\"<ref name=\"productionotes\" /> They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.<ref name=\"lat99\"/> The Giant was designed by filmmaker [[Joe Johnston]], which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Bird brought in students from [[CalArts]] to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"<ref name=\"lat99\"/> Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including [[Alias Systems Corporation]]'s [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], Alias' [[PowerAnimator]], a modified version of [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]], [[Softimage 3D|Softimage Creative Environment]], [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Cambridge Animation's Animo]] (now part of [[Toon Boom Technologies]]), [[Avid Elastic Reality]], and [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name=\"aa99\">{{cite news|date=August 10, 1999|title=An Interview with...

This is exemplified by Dean's statement that \"You are who you choose to be\", which Hogarth later relays to the Giant. When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote ''The Iron Man'' as a means of comforting his children after his wife, [[Sylvia Plath]], committed suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite video\n| title = The Iron Giant: Signature Edition (The Giant's Dream)\n| medium = Blu-ray\n| publisher = Warner Bros.

The film stars the voices of [[Vin Diesel]] (voicing the titular character), [[Eli Marienthal]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Christopher McDonald]] and [[John Mahoney]]. Set during the [[Cold War]] in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a gigantic metallic robot who fell from outer space. With the help of a [[beatnik]] artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\n\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a [[Musical film|musical]] with the involvement of [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]], though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using [[traditional animation]], with [[computer-generated imagery]] used to animate the titular character and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. [[Michael Kamen]] composed the film's score, which was performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic]].\n\n''The Iron Giant'' premiered at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theater]] in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999 and was released worldwide on August 6. Upon release, the film significantly under-performed at the box office, grossing $31.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $48 million, which was due to Warner Bros.' unusually poor marketing campaign and skepticism towards animated film production following the mixed critical reception and box office failure of ''[[Quest for Camelot]]'' in the preceding year. Despite this, the film received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed at the story, animation, characters, the portrayal of the title character and the voice performances of Aniston, Connick Jr., Diesel, Mahoney, Marienthal and McDonald. The film was nominated for several awards, winning nine [[Annie Awards]] out of 15 nominations. Through [[home video]] releases and television syndication, the film gathered a [[cult following]] and is now widely regarded as a modern animated classic.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/iron-giant-new-scenes-remastered-edition-release-date-1201601135/|title=Duncan Studios Adds New \u2018Iron Giant\u2019 Scenes for Remastered Re-release|quote=Brad Bird\u2019s 1999 '''animated classic''' ''The Iron Giant''...|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 2015|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Terry|last= Flores}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/2014/01/the_iron_giant_a_modern_classi.html|title='The Iron Giant,' a modern classic of animation returns: Indie & art house films|publisher=[[OregonLive.com]]|quote=Released in 1999, this '''modern classic''' of hand-drawn animation|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=October 5, 2015|first= Jamie S. |last=Rich}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Brad Bird's 'The Iron Giant'|quote=is now widely recognized as a '''modern classic'''|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=August 6, 2012|access-date=October 5, 2015|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006043238/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-brad-birds-the-iron-giant-20120806|archive-date=2015-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2015, an extended, [[remaster]]ed version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! -->\nDuring the [[Cold War]], shortly after the [[Soviet Union]] launched ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' in October 1957, an object from space crashes in the ocean just off the coast of Maine and then enters the forest near the town of Rockwell. The following night, 11-year-old Hogarth Hughes investigates and finds the object, a gigantic alien [[robot]] attempting to eat the transmission lines of an electrical substation. Hogarth eventually befriends the Giant, finding him docile and curious. When he eats railroad tracks in the path of an oncoming train, the train collides with him and derails; Hogarth leads the Giant away from the scene, discovering that he can self-repair. While there, Hogarth shows the Giant comic books chronicling the adventures of [[Superman]].\n\nThe incidents lead a xenophobic U.S. government agent named Kent Mansley to Rockwell. He suspects Hogarth's involvement after talking with him and his widowed mother Annie (Hogarth's father was a U.S. Air Force pilot who died during the [[Korean War]]), and rents a room in their house to keep watch on him. Hogarth evades Kent and moves the Giant to a junkyard owned by [[beatnik]] artist Dean McCoppin, who reluctantly agrees to keep him. Hogarth enjoys his time with the Giant, but is compelled to explain \"death\" after witnessing hunters killing a deer.\n\nThat night, Hogarth is interrogated by Kent when he discovers evidence of the Giant after finding a photo of him next to Hogarth and brings a U.S. Army contingent led by General Shannon Rogard to the scrapyard to prove the Giant's existence, but Dean (having been warned by Hogarth earlier) tricks them by pretending the Giant is one of his art pieces. Angered by the apparent false alarm, Rogard prepares to leave with his forces after berating Kent for his antics. Hogarth then continues to have fun with the Giant by playing with a toy gun, but inadvertently activates the Giant's defensive system and Dean orders it away for Hogarth's safety with Hogarth giving chase. Dean realizes the Giant was only acting in self-defense and catches up to Hogarth as they follow the Giant.\n\nThe Giant saves two boys falling from a roof when he arrives, winning over the townspeople. Kent jabbers wildly at Rogard to return to Rockwell when he spots the Giant in the town while leaving Rockwell; the Army attacks the Giant after he had picked up Hogarth, forcing the two to flee together. They initially evade the military by using the Giant's flight system, but the Giant is then shot down and crashes to the ground. Hogarth is knocked unconscious, but the Giant, thinking Hogarth is dead and the military are responsible, transforms into a war machine in a fit of grief and retaliates, forcing its way back to Rockwell. Kent then convinces Rogard to prepare a nuclear missile launch from the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']], as conventional weapons prove ineffective. Hogarth then wakes up and returns in time to calm the Giant while Dean clarifies the situation to Rogard. The General is ready to stand down when Kent impulsively orders the missile launch, causing the missile to head towards Rockwell where it will destroy everyone upon impact. Kent attempts to escape, but the Giant stops him and Rogard has him arrested for his actions. In order to save the town, the Giant bids farewell to Hogarth and flies off to intercept the missile. As he soars directly into the path of the missile, the Giant remembers Hogarth's words \"You are who you choose to be\", smiles contentedly and says \"Superman\" as he collides with the weapon. The missile explodes in the atmosphere, saving Rockwell, its population and the military forces nearby but seemingly at the cost of the Giant himself, leaving Hogarth devastated.\n\nMonths later, a memorial of the Giant stands in Rockwell and Dean and Annie begin a relationship. Hogarth is given a package from Rogard, containing a screw from the Giant which is the only remnant found. That night, Hogarth finds the screw trying to move on its own and, remembering the Giant's ability to self-repair, happily allows the screw to leave. The screw joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the [[Langj\u00f6kull]] glacier in [[Iceland]], and the Giant smiles as he begins reassembling himself.\n\n==Voice cast==\n<!--- Cast, order and roles per tombstone closing credits --->\n[[File:Iron Giant, LA Animation Festival, Christopher McDonald, Brad Bird, Eli Marienthol.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher McDonald]], [[Brad Bird]] and [[Eli Marienthal]] in March 2012 at the ''Iron Giant'' screening at the LA Animation Festival]]                                                                 \n\n* [[Eli Marienthal]] as Hogarth Hughes (named for illustrator Burne Hogarth), an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination.

Although the production was watched closely, Bird commented \"They did leave us alone if we kept it in control and showed them we were producing the film responsibly and getting it done on time and doing stuff that was good.\" Bird regarded the trade-off as having \"one-third of the money of a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] or [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] film, and half of the production schedule,\" but the payoff as having more creative freedom, describing the film as \"fully-made by the animation team; I don't think any other studio can say that to the level that we can.\"<ref name=\"awm99\"/> A small part of the team took a weeklong research trip to [[Maine]], where they photographed and videotaped five small cities.

The software became essential to that team\u2014dubbed \"Macro\" early on\u2014to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective.

Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film.<ref name=\"aa99.1\"/> Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. \"People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that we were really tapping into something,\" he recalled.<ref name=\"birdint09\"/>\n\nHe opted to give the film's animators portions to animate entirely, rather than the standard process of animating one character, in a throwback to the way Disney's first features were created.<ref name=\"lat99\"/><ref name=\"aa99.2\"/> The exception were those responsible for creating the Giant himself, who was created using [[computer-generated imagery]] due to the difficulty of creating a metal object \"in a fluid-like manner.\"<ref name=\"productionotes\" /> They had additional trouble with using the computer model to express emotion.<ref name=\"lat99\"/> The Giant was designed by filmmaker [[Joe Johnston]], which was refined by production designer Mark Whiting and Steve Markowski, head animator for the Giant.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Using software, the team would animate the Giant \"on twos\" (every other frame, or twelve frames per second) when interacting with other characters, to make it less obvious it was a computer model.<ref name=\"awm99\"/> Bird brought in students from [[CalArts]] to assist in minor animation work due to the film's busy schedule. He made sure to spread out the work on scenes between experienced and younger animators, noting, \"You overburden your strongest people and underburden the others [if you let your top talent monopolize the best assignments].\"<ref name=\"lat99\"/> Hiroki Itokazu designed all of the film's CGI props and vehicles, which were created in a variety of software, including [[Alias Systems Corporation]]'s [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], Alias' [[PowerAnimator]], a modified version of [[Pixar]]'s [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]], [[Softimage 3D|Softimage Creative Environment]], [[Cambridge Animation Systems|Cambridge Animation's Animo]] (now part of [[Toon Boom Technologies]]), [[Avid Elastic Reality]], and [[Adobe Photoshop]].<ref name=\"aa99\">{{cite news|date=August 10, 1999|title=An Interview with...

This is exemplified by Dean's statement that \"You are who you choose to be\", which Hogarth later relays to the Giant. When he began work on the film, Bird was in the midst of coping with the death of his sister, Susan, who was shot and killed by her estranged husband. In researching its source material, he learned that Hughes wrote ''The Iron Man'' as a means of comforting his children after his wife, [[Sylvia Plath]], committed suicide, specifically through the metaphor of the title character being able to re-assemble itself after being damaged. These experiences formed the basis of Bird's pitch to Warner Bros., which was based around the idea \"What if a gun had a soul, and didn't want to be a gun?\"; the completed film was also dedicated to Hughes and Susan.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite video\n| title = The Iron Giant: Signature Edition (The Giant's Dream)\n| medium = Blu-ray\n| publisher = Warner Bros.
