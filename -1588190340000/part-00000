{"title_page": "1958 United States Grand Prix for Sports Cars", "text_new": "The '''1958 United States Grand Prix for Sports Cars''' was a [[sports car racing|sports car race]] held at [[Riverside International Raceway]] on October 12, 1958.  It was the fourth and final round of the [[1958 USAC Road Racing Championship season]], the seventeenth round of the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s Pacific Coast Championship, the second running of the [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix|Riverside Grand Prix]], and the first post-[[World War II]] running of the [[United States Grand Prix]].  The race was held over 62 laps of Riverside's {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} circuit, for a total of {{convert|203.1|mi|km}}.  [[Chuck Daigh]] won the race overall, driving one of [[Lance Reventlow]]'s [[Scarab (constructor)|Scarab]]-[[Chevrolet]]s. The race is also noteworthy in the annals of international racing, as the strong second-place finish by a local driver named Dan Gurney earned him a test drive in a factory Ferrari Formula 1 car, effectively launching the Californian's legendary racing career.\n\nThe weather at this event was very warm, even for a desert climate that routinely saw daytime temperatures of 100F plus during the summer. On race day the temperature reached an extraordinary high for the era {{convert|95|F|C}}; with winds gusting up to {{convert|9.9|mph|km/h}} on race day.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/CA/Moreno%20Valley/1958-10-12| title = Weather information for the ''1958 United States Grand Prix for Sports Cars'' | publisher = The Old Farmers' Almanac | accessdate = 2013-11-13}}</ref> Even with the global warming that emerged decades after the late 1950s, the maximum temperature of Riverside, California never exceeded {{convert|79.2|F|C}} for the month of October 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/CA/Moreno%20Valley/2013-10-12| title = Weather comparison \u2013 2010s climate vs 1950s climate | publisher = The Old Farmers' Almanac | accessdate = 2013-11-13}}</ref>\n\n==Entry==\nThe race was open to cars meeting the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s B Modified through G Modified classes.  Although named \"modified\", most of the cars in classes C through G were factory-built sports racing cars.  The field was unusually large for an American sports car race, attracted in large part by a large purse consisting of $14,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|14500|1958|r=2}}}} in today's money).<ref>{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Bill|title=Berha arrives to drive in $14,500 U.S. Grand Prix|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/585291432.html?dids=585291432:585291432&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+10%2C+1958&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=BEHRA+ARRIVES+TO+DRIVE+IN+%2414%2C500+U.S.+GRAND+PRIX&pqatl=google|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=10 October 1958}}</ref> \n{|class=wikitable\n!

[[Riverside International Raceway]] on October 12, 1958.  It was the fourth and final round of the [[1958 USAC Road Racing Championship season]], the seventeenth round of the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s Pacific Coast Championship, the second running of the [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix|Riverside Grand Prix]], and the first post-[[World War II]] running of the [[United States Grand Prix]].  The race was held over 62 laps of Riverside's {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} circuit, for a total of {{convert|203.1|mi|km}}.  [[Chuck Daigh]] won the race overall, driving one of [[Lance Reventlow]]'s [[Scarab (constructor)|Scarab]]-[[Chevrolet]]s. The race is also noteworthy in the annals of international racing, as the strong second-place finish by a local driver named Dan Gurney earned him a test drive in a factory Ferrari Formula 1 car, effectively launching the Californian's legendary racing career.\n\nThe weather at this event was very warm, even for a desert climate that routinely saw daytime temperatures of 100F plus during the summer. On race day the temperature reached an extraordinary high for the era {{convert|95|F|C}}; with winds gusting up to {{convert|9.9|mph|km/h}} on race day.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/CA/Moreno%20Valley/1958-10-12| title = Weather information for the ''1958 United States Grand Prix for Sports Cars'' | publisher = The Old Farmers' Almanac | accessdate = 2013-11-13}}</ref> Even with the global warming that emerged decades after the late 1950s, the maximum temperature of Riverside, California never exceeded {{convert|79.2|F|C}} for the month of October 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.almanac.com/weather/history/CA/Moreno%20Valley/2013-10-12| title = Weather comparison \u2013 2010s climate vs 1950s climate | publisher = The Old Farmers' Almanac | accessdate = 2013-11-13}}</ref>\n\n==Entry==\nThe race was open to cars meeting the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s B Modified through G Modified classes.  Although named \"modified\", most of the cars in classes C through G were factory-built sports racing cars.  The field was unusually large for an American sports car race, attracted in large part by a large purse consisting of $14,500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|14500|1958|r=2}}}} in today's money).<ref>{{cite news|last=Dredge|first=Bill|title=Berha arrives to drive in $14,500 U.S. Grand Prix|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/585291432.html?dids=585291432:585291432&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+10%2C+1958&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=BEHRA+ARRIVES+TO+DRIVE+IN+%2414%2C500+U.S.+GRAND+PRIX&pqatl=google|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=10 October 1958}}</ref> \n{|class=wikitable\n!

According to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] teaching, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]], is said to have been [[Assumption of Mary|assumed into heaven]] without the corruption of her earthly body; she is venerated as [[Queen of Heaven]].\n\nIn the [[Christian Bible]], concepts about [[Christian eschatology]], the future \"[[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]]\", and the [[resurrection of the dead]] are found, particularly in the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] and in 1 Corinthians 15.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|language=en|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity|Heaven in Judaism}}\n\nThe 1st century early [[Jewish Christian|Jewish-Christians]], from whom Christianity developed as a Gentile religion, believed that the [[Kingdom of God]] was coming to earth within their own lifetimes, and looked forward to a divine future on earth.<ref name = \"Ehrman 2006\"/> According to [[Bart Ehrman]], when the Kingdom of God did not arrive, Christian beliefs gradually changed into the expectation of an immediate reward in heaven after death, rather than to a future divine kingdom on earth,<ref name = \"Ehrman 2006\"/> despite the churches' continuing to use the major creeds' statements of belief in a coming resurrection day and [[world to come]].\n\nThe earliest of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], [[Clement of Rome]], does not mention entry into Heaven after death but instead expresses belief in the [[resurrection of the dead]] after a [[Intermediate state|period of \"slumber\"]]<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html 1 Clement] \"26:2 For he saith in a certain place, And thou shalt raise me up, and I will give thanks unto thee; and again: I slumbered and slept; I arose up because thou art with me.\"</ref> at the [[Second Coming]].<ref>E.

At the time of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], paradise touched the earth at the [[Garden of Eden]]. After the [[Fall of man]], paradise was separated from the earth, and mankind forbidden entry, lest he partake of the [[Tree of Life]] and live eternally in a state of sinfulness ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|HE}}). At his [[Death of Jesus|death on the Cross]], the Orthodox believe Jesus opened the door to Paradise to mankind again ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:43|KJV}}), and the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Good Thief]] was the first to enter.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2-4|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"\u2026a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, from whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away\".<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], it is only [[God]] who has the final say on who enters heaven. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, heaven is part and parcel of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]]''), the eternal sharing of the divine qualities through communion with the Triune God (reunion of Father and Son through love).\n\n==Roman Catholicism==\n{{see also|Keys of Heaven}}\n{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Catholic Church teaches that \"heaven is the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1024]</ref> In heaven one experiences the [[beatific vision]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2M.HTM CCC 1023]</ref> The church holds that,\n{{quote|by his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has 'opened' heaven to us.

Heaven is the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1026]</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill God's will in relation to other men and to all creation.

[[Pope John Paul II]] declared:\n{{quote|The 'heaven' or 'happiness' in which we will find ourselves is neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It is our meeting with the Father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit.<ref name=\"JPII\"/>}}\n\nThose Christians who die still imperfectly purified must, according to Catholic teaching, pass through a state of purification known as [[purgatory]] before entering heaven.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030]</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave this explanation of what is meant by heaven:\n{{Quote|We all experience that when people die they continue to exist, in a certain way, in the memory and heart of those who knew and loved them. We might say that a part of the person lives on in them but it resembles a \"shadow\" because this survival in the heart of their loved ones is destined to end. God, on the contrary, never passes away and we all exist by virtue of his love. We exist because he loves us, because he conceived of us and called us to life. We exist in God's thoughts and in God's love. We exist in the whole of our reality, not only in our \"shadow\". Our serenity, our hope and our peace are based precisely on this: in God, in his thoughts and in his love, it is not merely a \"shadow\" of ourselves that survives but rather we are preserved and ushered into eternity with the whole of our being in him, in his creator love. It is his Love that triumphs over death and gives us eternity and it is this love that we call \"Heaven\": God is so great that he also makes room for us. And Jesus the man, who at the same time is God, is the guarantee for us that the being-man and the being-God can exist and live, the one within the other, for eternity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100815_assunzione_en.html Homily by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 August 2010]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Pope John Paul II]],\n{{quote|The New Testament amplifies the idea of heaven in relation to the mystery of Christ. To show that the Redeemer's sacrifice acquires perfect and definitive value, the Letter to the Hebrews says that Jesus \"passed through the heavens\" (Heb. 4:14), and \"entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself\" (ibid., 9:24). Since believers are loved in a special way by the Father, they are raised with Christ and made citizens of heaven... After the course of our earthly life, participation in complete intimacy with the Father thus comes through our insertion into Christ's paschal mystery...\"<ref name=JPII/>}}\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church indicates several images of heaven found in the Bible:\n{{quote|This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the Father's house, the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], paradise: 'no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him'.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1027]</ref>}}\n\n==Protestant Christianity==\n{{See also|Intermediate state|Christian mortalism|Arminianism|Calvinism}}\nSome denominations teach that one enters heaven at the moment of death, while others teach that this occurs at a later time (the [[Last Judgment]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Some Christians maintain that entry into Heaven awaits such time as \"When the form of this world has passed away.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]</ref>\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the \"[[resurrection of the body]]\" as contrasted with \"the [[immortality of the soul]]\". In the first, the [[soul]] does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the soul goes to a heaven on another plane immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is [[Particular judgment|judged once at death]] and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a [[General judgment|second and final judgement]] at the end of the world.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII]</ref>\n\nSome teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.<ref>Moody, D.L.

The afterlife is divided first into two levels until the Last Judgement; afterwards it is divided into four levels, the upper three of which are referred to as \"degrees of glory\" that, for illustrative purposes, are compared to the brightness of heavenly bodies: the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]].\n\nBefore the Last Judgment, spirits separated from their bodies at death go either to [[Paradise#Mormonism|paradise]] or to [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]] dependent on if they had been baptised and confirmed by the laying on of hands. Paradise is a place of rest while its inhabitants continue learning in preparation for the Last Judgement. Spirit Prison is a place of learning for the wicked and unrepentant and those who were not baptised; however, missionary efforts done by spirits from Paradise enable those in Spirit Prison to repent, accept the gospel and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and receive baptism through the practice of [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|128|18}}, [[Standard Works]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]</ref>\n\nAfter the resurrection and Last Judgement, people are sent to one of four levels:\n* The [[Celestial Kingdom]] is the highest level, with its power and glory comparable to the sun. Here, faithful and valiant disciples of Christ who accepted the fullness of his gospel and kept their covenants with Him through following the prophets of their dispensation are reunited with their families and with God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit for all eternity. Those who would have accepted the gospel with all their hearts had they been given the opportunity in life (as judged by Christ and God the Father) are also saved in the Celestial Kingdom.

At the time of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], paradise touched the earth at the [[Garden of Eden]]. After the [[Fall of man]], paradise was separated from the earth, and mankind forbidden entry, lest he partake of the [[Tree of Life]] and live eternally in a state of sinfulness ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|HE}}). At his [[Death of Jesus|death on the Cross]], the Orthodox believe Jesus opened the door to Paradise to mankind again ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:43|KJV}}), and the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Good Thief]] was the first to enter.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2-4|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"\u2026a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, from whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away\".<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], it is only [[God]] who has the final say on who enters heaven. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, heaven is part and parcel of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]]''), the eternal sharing of the divine qualities through communion with the Triune God (reunion of Father and Son through love).\n\n==Roman Catholicism==\n{{see also|Keys of Heaven}}\n{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Catholic Church teaches that \"heaven is the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1024]</ref> In heaven one experiences the [[beatific vision]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2M.HTM CCC 1023]</ref> The church holds that,\n{{quote|by his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has 'opened' heaven to us. The life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect possession of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ... Heaven is the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1026]</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill God's will in relation to other men and to all creation. Already they reign with Christ; with him 'they shall reign for ever and ever' ({{bibleverse||Rev|22:5}}).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1029]</ref>}}\n\nHeaven is considered a state, a condition of existence, rather than a particular place somewhere in the [[cosmos]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] declared:\n{{quote|The 'heaven' or 'happiness' in which we will find ourselves is neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It is our meeting with the Father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit.<ref name=\"JPII\"/>}}\n\nThose Christians who die still imperfectly purified must, according to Catholic teaching, pass through a state of purification known as [[purgatory]] before entering heaven.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030]</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave this explanation of what is meant by heaven:\n{{Quote|We all experience that when people die they continue to exist, in a certain way, in the memory and heart of those who knew and loved them. We might say that a part of the person lives on in them but it resembles a \"shadow\" because this survival in the heart of their loved ones is destined to end. God, on the contrary, never passes away and we all exist by virtue of his love. We exist because he loves us, because he conceived of us and called us to life. We exist in God's thoughts and in God's love. We exist in the whole of our reality, not only in our \"shadow\". Our serenity, our hope and our peace are based precisely on this: in God, in his thoughts and in his love, it is not merely a \"shadow\" of ourselves that survives but rather we are preserved and ushered into eternity with the whole of our being in him, in his creator love. It is his Love that triumphs over death and gives us eternity and it is this love that we call \"Heaven\": God is so great that he also makes room for us. And Jesus the man, who at the same time is God, is the guarantee for us that the being-man and the being-God can exist and live, the one within the other, for eternity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100815_assunzione_en.html Homily by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 August 2010]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Pope John Paul II]],\n{{quote|The New Testament amplifies the idea of heaven in relation to the mystery of Christ. To show that the Redeemer's sacrifice acquires perfect and definitive value, the Letter to the Hebrews says that Jesus \"passed through the heavens\" (Heb. 4:14), and \"entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself\" (ibid., 9:24). Since believers are loved in a special way by the Father, they are raised with Christ and made citizens of heaven... After the course of our earthly life, participation in complete intimacy with the Father thus comes through our insertion into Christ's paschal mystery...\"<ref name=JPII/>}}\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church indicates several images of heaven found in the Bible:\n{{quote|This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the Father's house, the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], paradise: 'no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him'.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1027]</ref>}}\n\n==Protestant Christianity==\n{{See also|Intermediate state|Christian mortalism|Arminianism|Calvinism}}\nSome denominations teach that one enters heaven at the moment of death, while others teach that this occurs at a later time (the [[Last Judgment]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Some Christians maintain that entry into Heaven awaits such time as \"When the form of this world has passed away.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]</ref>\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the \"[[resurrection of the body]]\" as contrasted with \"the [[immortality of the soul]]\". In the first, the [[soul]] does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the soul goes to a heaven on another plane immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is [[Particular judgment|judged once at death]] and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a [[General judgment|second and final judgement]] at the end of the world.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII]</ref>\n\nSome teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.<ref>Moody, D.L.

The afterlife is divided first into two levels until the Last Judgement; afterwards it is divided into four levels, the upper three of which are referred to as \"degrees of glory\" that, for illustrative purposes, are compared to the brightness of heavenly bodies: the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]].\n\nBefore the Last Judgment, spirits separated from their bodies at death go either to [[Paradise#Mormonism|paradise]] or to [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]] dependent on if they had been baptised and confirmed by the laying on of hands. Paradise is a place of rest while its inhabitants continue learning in preparation for the Last Judgement. Spirit Prison is a place of learning for the wicked and unrepentant and those who were not baptised; however, missionary efforts done by spirits from Paradise enable those in Spirit Prison to repent, accept the gospel and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and receive baptism through the practice of [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|128|18}}, [[Standard Works]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]</ref>\n\nAfter the resurrection and Last Judgement, people are sent to one of four levels:\n* The [[Celestial Kingdom]] is the highest level, with its power and glory comparable to the sun. Here, faithful and valiant disciples of Christ who accepted the fullness of his gospel and kept their covenants with Him through following the prophets of their dispensation are reunited with their families and with God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit for all eternity. Those who would have accepted the gospel with all their hearts had they been given the opportunity in life (as judged by Christ and God the Father) are also saved in the Celestial Kingdom. Latter-Day Saint movements do not believe in the concept of [[original sin]], but believe children to be innocent through the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Therefore, all children who die before the [[age of accountability]] inherit this glory. Men and women who have entered into [[celestial marriage]] are eligible, under the tutelage of God the Father, to eventually become gods and goddesses as joint-heirs with Jesus Christ.\n* The [[Terrestrial Kingdom]]'s power and glory is comparable to that of the moon, and is reserved for those who understood and rejected the full gospel in life but lived good lives; those who did accept the gospel but failed to keep their covenants through continuing the process of faith, repentance, and service to others; those who \"died without law\" (D & C 76:72) but accepted the full gospel and repented after death due to the missionary efforts undertaken in Spirit Prison.

{"title_page": "Kodaira\u2013Spencer map", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Kodaira\u2013Spencer map''', introduced by [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], is a map associated to a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] of a [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] or [[complex manifold]] ''X'', taking a [[tangent space]] of a point of the [[deformation space]] to the first [[cohomology group]] of the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[vector field]]s on&nbsp;''X''.\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== Historical motivation ===\nThe Kodaira-Spencer map was originally constructed in the setting of complex manifolds. Given a complex analytic manifold <math>M</math> with charts <math>U_i</math> and biholomorphic maps <math>f_{jk}</math> sending <math>z_k \\to z_j = (z_j^1,\\ldots, z_j^n)</math> gluing the charts together, the idea of deformation theory is to replace these transition maps <math>f_{jk}(z_k)</math> by parametrized transition maps <math>f_{jk}(z_k, t_1,\\ldots, t_k)</math> over some base <math>B</math> (which could be a real manifold) with coordinates <math>t_1,\\ldots, t_k</math>, such that <math>f_{jk}(z_k, 0,\\ldots, 0) = f_{jk}(z_k)</math>. This means the parameters <math>t_i</math> deform the complex structure of the original complex manifold <math>M</math>. Then, these functions must also satisfy a cocycle condition, which gives a 1-cocycle on <math>M</math> with values in its tangent bundle. Since the base can be assumed to be a polydisk, this process gives a map between the tangent space of the base to <math>H^1(M, T_M)</math> called the Kodaira-Spencer map<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Kodaira|first=|url=https://link-springer-com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/book/10.1007%2Fb138372|title=Complex Manifolds and Deformation of Complex Structures|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=182-184, 188-189}}</ref>.\n\n=== Original definition ===\nMore formally, the '''Kodaira\u2013Spencer map''' is<ref>{{harvnb|Huybrechts|2005|loc=6.2.6.}}</ref>\n\n:<math>KS: T_0 B \\to H^1(M, T_M)</math>\n\nwhere\n*<math>\\mathcal{M} \\to B</math> is a smooth proper map between [[complex space (algebraic geometry)|complex space]]s<ref>The main difference between a complex manifold and a complex space is that the latter is allowed to have a nilpotent.</ref> (i.e., a deformation of the [[special fiber]] <math>M = \\mathcal{M}_0</math>.)\n*<math>\\delta</math> is the connecting homomorphism obtained by taking a long exact cohomology sequence of the surjection <math>T \\mathcal{M}|_M \\to T_0 B \\otimes \\mathcal{O}_M</math> whose kernel is the tangent bundle <math>T_M</math>.\n\nIf <math>v</math> is in <math>T_0B</math>, then its image <math>KS(v)</math> is called the '''Kodaira\u2013Spencer class''' of <math>v</math>.\n\n=== Remarks ===\nBecause deformation theory has been extended to multiple other contexts, such as deformations in scheme theory, or ringed topoi, there are constructions of the Kodaira-Spencer map for these contexts.\n\nIn the scheme theory over a base field <math>k</math> of characteristic <math>0</math>, there is a natural bijection between isomorphisms classes of <math>\\mathcal{X} \\to S = \\operatorname{Spec}(k[t]/t^2)</math> and <math>H^1(X, TX)</math>.\n\n== Constructions ==\n\n=== Using infinitesimals ===\n\n==== Cocycle condition for deformations ====\nOver characteristic <math>0</math> the construction of the Kodaira-Spencer map<ref>{{Cite book|last=Arbarello|first=|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540426882|title=Geometry of Algebraic Curves II|last2=Cornalba|last3=Griffiths|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=172-174}}</ref> can be done using an infinitesimal interpretation of the cocycle condition. If we have a complex manifold <math>X</math> covered by finitely many charts <math>\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in I}</math> with coordinates <math>z_\\alpha = (z_\\alpha^1, \\ldots, z_\\alpha^n)</math> and transition functions <blockquote><math>f_{\\beta\\alpha}:U_\\beta|_{U_{\\alpha\\beta}} \\to U_\\alpha|_{U_{\\alpha\\beta}}</math> where <math>f_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta) = z_\\alpha</math></blockquote>Recall that a deformation is given by a commutative diagram<blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}) & \\to & \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>where <math>\\mathbb{C}[\\varepsilon]</math> is the [[ring of dual numbers]] and the vertical maps are flat, the deformation has the cohomological interpretation as cocycles <math>\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta,\\varepsilon)</math> on <math>U_\\alpha\\times \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[\\varepsilon])</math> where<blockquote><math>z_\\alpha = \\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta,\\varepsilon) = f_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta) + \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta)</math></blockquote>If the <math>\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta}</math> satisfy the cocycle condition, then they glue to the deformation <math>\\mathfrak{X}</math>. This can be read as<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\gamma}(z_\\gamma,\\varepsilon) = & \\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\tilde{f}_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma,\\varepsilon),\\varepsilon) \\\\\n= & f_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) \\\\\n& + \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma))\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Using the properties of the dual numbers, namely <math>g(a + b\\varepsilon) = g(a) + \\varepsilon g'(a)b</math>, we have<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nf_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) = & f_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\alpha}(z_\\alpha)b_{\\beta_\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) \\\\\n\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) = & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) + \\varepsilon^2\\frac{\\partial b_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\alpha}(z_\\alpha)b_{\\beta_\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) \\\\ \n= & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) \\\\\n= & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta)\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>hence the cocycle condition on <math>U_\\alpha\\times \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[\\varepsilon])</math> is the following two rules\n\n# <math>b_{\\alpha\\gamma} = \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\beta}b_{\\beta\\gamma} + b_{\\alpha\\beta}</math>\n# <math>f_{\\alpha\\gamma} = f_{\\alpha\\beta} \\circ f_{\\beta\\gamma}</math> \n\n==== Conversion to cocycles of vector fields ====\nThe cocycle of the deformation can easily be converted to a cocycle of vector fields <math>\\theta = \\{\\theta_{\\alpha\\beta} \\} \\in C^1(\\mathcal{U},T_X)</math> as follows: given the cocycle <math>\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta} = f_{\\alpha\\beta} + \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}</math> we can form the vector field<blockquote><math>\\theta_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_{\\alpha\\beta}^i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_\\alpha^i}</math></blockquote>which is a 1-cochain. Then the rule for the transition maps of <math>b_{\\alpha\\gamma}</math> gives this 1-cochain as a 1-cocycle, hence a class <math>[\\theta] \\in H^1(X,T_X)</math>.\n\n=== Using vector fields ===\nOne of the original constructions of this map used vector fields in the settings of differential geometry and complex analysis<ref name=\":0\" />. Given the notation above, the transition from a deformation to the cocycle condition is transparent over a small base of dimension one, so there is only one parameter <math>t</math>. Then, the cocycle condition can be read as<blockquote><math>f^{\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t) = f_{ij}^{\\alpha}(f^1_{kj}(z_k,t), \\ldots, f^n_{kj}(z_k,t),t)</math></blockquote>Then, the derivative of <math>f^{\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)</math> with respect to <math>t</math> can be calculated from the previous equation as<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t} &= \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\partial t}\n + \\sum^n_{\\beta = 0} \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\partial f_{jk}^\\beta(z_k,t)}\\cdot\n \\frac{\\partial f^{\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Note because <math>z_j^\\beta = f_{jk}^\\beta(z_k,t)</math> and <math>z_i^\\alpha = f_{ij}^{\\alpha}(z_j,t)</math>, then the derivative reads as <blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t} &= \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\partial t}\n + \\sum^n_{\\beta = 0} \\frac{\\partial z^{\\alpha}_i}{\\partial z_j^\\beta}\\cdot\n \\frac{\\partial f^{\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>If we use write a holomorphic vector field, having these partial derivatives as the coefficients, then because<blockquote><math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_j^\\beta} = \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^n\n\\frac{\n    \\partial z_i^\\alpha\n}{\n    \\partial z_j^\\beta\n}\\cdot \\frac{\n    \\partial\n}{\n    \\partial z_i^\\alpha\n}</math></blockquote>we get the following equation of vector fields<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^n \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ik}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i^\\alpha} =&\n\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^n \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i^\\alpha}\n\\\\& + \\sum^n_{\\beta = 0}\n \\frac{\\partial f^{\\beta}_{jk}(z_k,t)}{\\partial t}  \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_j^\\beta}  \\\\\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Rewriting this as the vector fields<blockquote><math>\\theta_{ik}(t) = \\theta_{ij}(t) + \\theta_{jk}(t)</math></blockquote>where<blockquote><math>\\theta_{ij}(t) = \\frac{\\partial f^{\\alpha}_{ij}(z_j,t)}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i^\\alpha} </math></blockquote>gives the cocycle condition. Hence this has associated a class in <math>H^1(M,T_M)</math> from a deformation.\n\n=== In scheme theory ===\nDeformations of a smooth variety<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mat.uniroma3.it/users/sernesi/sernesioverviewdefth.pdf|title=An overview of classical deformation theory|last=Sernesi|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200427180649/http://www.mat.uniroma3.it/users/sernesi/sernesioverviewdefth.pdf|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><blockquote><math>\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\text{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\text{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}</math></blockquote>have a Kodaira-Spencer class constructed cohomologically.

This means the parameters <math>t_i</math> deform the complex structure of the original complex manifold <math>M</math>. Then, these functions must also satisfy a cocycle condition, which gives a 1-cocycle on <math>M</math> with values in its tangent bundle.

This can be read as<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\gamma}(z_\\gamma,\\varepsilon) = & \\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\tilde{f}_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma,\\varepsilon),\\varepsilon) \\\\\n= & f_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) \\\\\n& + \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma))\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Using the properties of the dual numbers, namely <math>g(a + b\\varepsilon) = g(a) + \\varepsilon g'(a)b</math>, we have<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nf_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) = & f_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) + \\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\alpha}(z_\\alpha)b_{\\beta_\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) \\\\\n\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) + \\varepsilon b_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) = & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) + \\varepsilon^2\\frac{\\partial b_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\alpha}(z_\\alpha)b_{\\beta_\\gamma}(z_\\gamma) \\\\ \n= & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(f_{\\beta\\gamma}(z_\\gamma)) \\\\\n= & \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}(z_\\beta)\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>hence the cocycle condition on <math>U_\\alpha\\times \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[\\varepsilon])</math> is the following two rules\n\n# <math>b_{\\alpha\\gamma} = \\frac{\\partial f_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial z_\\beta}b_{\\beta\\gamma} + b_{\\alpha\\beta}</math>\n# <math>f_{\\alpha\\gamma} = f_{\\alpha\\beta} \\circ f_{\\beta\\gamma}</math> \n\n==== Conversion to cocycles of vector fields ====\nThe cocycle of the deformation can easily be converted to a cocycle of vector fields <math>\\theta = \\{\\theta_{\\alpha\\beta} \\} \\in C^1(\\mathcal{U},T_X)</math> as follows: given the cocycle <math>\\tilde{f}_{\\alpha\\beta} = f_{\\alpha\\beta} + \\varepsilon b_{\\alpha\\beta}</math> we can form the vector field<blockquote><math>\\theta_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_{\\alpha\\beta}^i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_\\alpha^i}</math></blockquote>which is a 1-cochain.

Given the notation above, the transition from a deformation to the cocycle condition is transparent over a small base of dimension one, so there is only one parameter <math>t</math>.

The first introduces Pancho as a young idealist and his mother's favorite son, who left home imagining that being on the road would result in freedom and purity of heart - but only resulted in having \"skin like iron and breath like kerosene\". The second stanza adds that he acquired a fast horse, had become a bandit, made no excuses about what he now was, and was ultimately cut down in the deserts of Mexico.  After the refrain, the third stanza introduces Lefty who was negatively impacted by Pancho's death but also indicates he was directly responsible - that he fled to the US the same day using funds from an unknown source. The final stanza is an epilogue which depicts Pancho's life being glorified by others while Lefty's fate is to just grow old in ignoble circumstances. A line from the last stanza implies that the betrayal was most likely due to Lefty's disillusionment with the life of being an outlaw and needing the reward money to break free - \"He only did what he had to do\".\n\n==Video release==\nA music video was released for the song in 1983, depicting [[Willie Nelson]] as Pancho, and [[Merle Haggard]] as Lefty. [[Townes Van Zandt]] also appears in a supporting role. Willie's daughter Lana (who was the one that suggested the recording of the duet) directed the video, the first for Nelson and second for Haggard, the first being for \"Are the Good Times Really Over?\" a year prior.\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe song reached No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Country Songs for chart dated July 23, 1983.
