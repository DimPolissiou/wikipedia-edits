Farah's mother, Hayet ([[Ghalia Benali]]) receives a visit from an old friend, Moncef, who warns her of the police involvement and warns her to watch her daughter. However, the night of their first gig, Farah locks her mother in her room and escapes to sing at the gig. The performance goes well, giving Farah confidence to continue with her musical pursuits, despite Hayet wanting Farah to study medicine at university.\n\nAfter several more gigs, Borh\u00e8ne arrives at a rehearsal having been interrogated and beaten by the police all night.

Hayet tries everything to locate her but eventually realizes that Farah has been taken by the police.

A '''prize-linked savings account''' or '''PLSA''' (also called a '''lottery-linked deposit account''') is a [[savings account]] where some of the [[interest]] payment on [[bank deposit]]s or marketing dollars are distributed as prizes based on chance. They are attractive to consumers as they function both as a sweepstakes or game of chance (as there is a chance of a large prize) and as savings (the deposit is never lost, unlike normal lotteries) vehicle.

One such concept is the [[availability heuristic]]. Essentially people are likely to associate and have faith in things which readily come to mind, such as winning a lottery, as lottery winners are prevalent in media. Another behavioral economic concept which contributes to the success of prize linked savings is the [[sunk cost]] <nowiki/>fallacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mating-game/201612/the-psychology-why-we-play-lotto|title=The Psychology of Why We Play Lotto|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> This is displayed in prize linked savings as people who use these accounts will often save an increasing amount of money to up their odds in winning the prize, regardless of how small the odds are. The misunderstanding of small probabilities also can be attributed to the success of prize linked savings as it is nearly impossible for any individual to fathom odds in the millions as our day to day lives deal with quantities going no higher than a few thousand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sex-drugs-economics.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-behavioural-economics-of-lotto.html|title=Sex, Drugs and Economics: The behavioural economics of Lotto|last=Cameron|first=Michael|date=2016-12-28|website=Sex, Drugs and Economics|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> The demand for prize linked savings accounts is seen to be highest amongst those with relatively low savings.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tufano|first=Peter|date=October 2006|title=Consumer Demand for Prize-Linked Savings: A Preliminary Analysis|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/08-061_17c22e32-fe06-4b4a-8b5e-e09227fc8104.pdf|journal=D2d Fund|volume=z|pages=|via=}}</ref> This group of individuals is also more prone to gambling so Prize-Linked savings accounts have more potential to induce savings in this population.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Skewness]] also plays into the appeal of PLSAs as it is essentially the idea that there is some chance to win a big prize with possible odds that could be realized (although they are small).\n\n== Institutional appeal of prize linked savings ==\n\nPrize linked savings account have several appeals to financial institutions which other savings and investment vehicles do not offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w16433.pdf|website=www.nber.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> The first of which is ease of marketing.

One such concept is the [[availability heuristic]]. Essentially people are likely to associate and have faith in things which readily come to mind, such as winning a lottery, as lottery winners are prevalent in media. Another behavioral economic concept which contributes to the success of prize linked savings is the [[sunk cost]] <nowiki/>fallacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-mating-game/201612/the-psychology-why-we-play-lotto|title=The Psychology of Why We Play Lotto|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> This is displayed in prize linked savings as people who use these accounts will often save an increasing amount of money to up their odds in winning the prize, regardless of how small the odds are. The misunderstanding of small probabilities also can be attributed to the success of prize linked savings as it is nearly impossible for any individual to fathom odds in the millions as our day to day lives deal with quantities going no higher than a few thousand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sex-drugs-economics.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-behavioural-economics-of-lotto.html|title=Sex, Drugs and Economics: The behavioural economics of Lotto|last=Cameron|first=Michael|date=2016-12-28|website=Sex, Drugs and Economics|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref> The demand for prize linked savings accounts is seen to be highest amongst those with relatively low savings.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tufano|first=Peter|date=October 2006|title=Consumer Demand for Prize-Linked Savings: A Preliminary Analysis|url=https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/08-061_17c22e32-fe06-4b4a-8b5e-e09227fc8104.pdf|journal=D2d Fund|volume=z|pages=|via=}}</ref> This group of individuals is also more prone to gambling so Prize-Linked savings accounts have more potential to induce savings in this population.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Skewness]] also plays into the appeal of PLSAs as it is essentially the idea that there is some chance to win a big prize with possible odds that could be realized (although they are small).\n\n== Institutional appeal of prize linked savings ==\n\nPrize linked savings account have several appeals to financial institutions which other savings and investment vehicles do not offer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w16433.pdf|website=www.nber.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> The first of which is ease of marketing. While it may be difficult for a banker to make a traditional savings account sound anything but drab, a PLSA has lottery like factor to it which could easily be sold to consumers. Also PLSAs are not very complex in their investment strategy and typically go for risk adverse vehicles so they often require less effort and maintenance on behalf of the institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w16433.pdf|website=www.nber.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> They offer the consumer transparency and legitimacy as the institution can consistently offer the same prize through the adjustment of odds in relation to the amount of interest being made on the collective fund.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w16433.pdf|website=www.nber.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> Finally, PLSAs can maximize the liquidity of their consumers by denying those who frequently make withdrawals eligibility to win prizes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w16433.pdf|website=www.nber.org|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*[[Premium Bond]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.buildcommonwealth.org Commonwealth] (formerly D2D Fund)\n* [http://freakonomics.com/podcast/say-no-no-lose-lottery-rebroadcast/ No-Lose Lottery] from [[Freakonomics]]\n* [https://www.nsandi.com/premium-bonds UK Premium Bonds]\n* \"[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/05/how-to-trick-people-into-saving-money/521421/ How to Trick People Into Saving Money]\" ''The Atlantic.''

He attempts to save his former lover, played by [[Rachael Taylor]], while learning who has targeted him and why.\n\n==Plot==\nRenton wakes up beside his former lover, Hannah. Three men break into his bedroom and, when Renton breaks his neck while escaping, he wakes with a start where he was just a moment earlier. The men break in once again and bind him and Hannah to chairs in another room. Their leader, Father, says he represents a rebel group known as the Bloc and demands Renton surrender money or \"scrips\" that he had stolen from their rival organization, the Torus Corporation.\n\nFather and the two other men, Sonny and Brother, leave to eat in another room and Renton is able to cut himself and Hannah loose. He explains that he built the ARQ, a working [[perpetual motion machine]], while working for Torus and then stole the machine. Hannah urges him to comply with the men, but he tries to escape and dies. He wakes with a start back in bed with Hannah, only to relive the same scenario. This time, after freeing the two of them, he asks Hannah to help poison the intruders with cyanide gas. The plan fails when Hannah reveals that she is a member of the Bloc. Renton surrenders the scrips and then Sonny shoots him.\n\nIn the next iteration, Renton questions Hannah about her past before freeing her. She admits that she grew to resent him after he abandoned her to Torus, who tortured her. Though he does not trust Hannah, Renton and Hannah work out a deal where they will split the scrips after using the cyanide gas to force Father and his group to stand down. Once they have the three men captured, though, Renton reneges on the deal, demanding that Hannah abandon the Bloc and come with him. Hannah accidentally shoots Renton in an ensuing scuffle. When Renton and Hannah wake up together, she can now recall the previous iteration. Renton theorizes that the ARQ is causing a [[time loop]]. Eventually, Sonny reveals himself as a Torus mercenary and kills everyone.\n\nRenton and Hannah agree in the next iteration that they must keep the ARQ from Torus. They convince Father to help them stop Sonny but, once they do, Brother shoots Renton, not realizing that Sonny works for Torus. In the next iteration, Sonny becomes aware of the time loop and immediately kills Father and Brother. When Sonny overpowers them, Renton sacrifices himself to prevent Sonny from acquiring the ARQ.\n\nIn the next iteration, Sonny saves Cuz's life, then kills Father and Brother. Renton and Hannah poison Sonny and Cuz with the cyanide. Before dying, Sonny sets a trap that kills Hannah, prompting Renton to allow the next iteration to begin. Everyone is now aware of the time loop, and Sonny and Cuz take everyone hostage. After Sonny forces Renton to disable the machine, Father and Brother die in the confusion of a blackout. Renton and Hannah briefly escape and realize the time loop is localized to the house. Renton decides to go back inside to destroy the machine and Hannah goes back with him.\n\nAfter they kill Cuz, who turns out to have been Hannah's torturer, Sonny restarts the ARQ, only to be killed himself. An interrupted video message and the ARQ's logs reveal a second, outer time loop: after every nine time loops, all of their memories are reset. They have unknowingly repeated the same nine loops thousands of times. Realizing they are on their ninth loop, Renton and Hannah leave a desperate message to themselves, hoping future iterations can get the ARQ to the Bloc before Torus's reinforcements arrive.  After a robot breaks through and kills them, Hannah wakes with a gasp.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robbie Amell]] as Renton\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as Hannah / Mother\n* [[Shaun Benson]] as Sonny\n* Gray Powell as Grimm / Father\n* Jacob Neayem as Brother\n* [[Adam Butcher]] as Cuz\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as The Pope\n* Nicolas Van Burek as News Anchor\n* Jamie Spilchuk as Mobius Common\n}}\n\n==Production==\nThe concept dates back to 2008, prior to writer-director Tony Elliot's work on the television series ''[[Orphan Black]]''; the show's creators hired him based on his unproduced script.

He runs to a waiting car, where Sylvie ([[Veerle Baetens]]) asks him where his brother is. Dave says that he had to leave him behind. Dave's brother, Kenny ([[Kevin Janssens (actor)|Kevin Janssens]]) is arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nFour years later, Dave is working at a car wash and Sylvie is working as a waitress at a sleazy nightclub; both are now sober and Sylvie attends regular AA meetings. One day at work, Dave gets a phone call informing him that Kenny is getting released early. That night, he goes to pick up Sylvie at work, and it is revealed that they have been dating for some time and Sylvie is pregnant with Dave's child. Sylvie wants to tell Kenny about their relationship, but Dave is reluctant.\n\nDave goes to pick Kenny up from prison. They stop on the way back to deliver a Christmas tree to their mother, Mariette ([[Viviane de Muynck]]). She makes Dave promise that he will take care of Kenny and stop him from getting in any more trouble. The following day, Dave takes Kenny with him to work at the carwash, and asks his boss, Robert, if he will hire Kenny. Robert initially says no, but after he loses a bet concerning a penalty kick in the soccer game that he is watching on TV, he hesitantly hires Kenny.\n\nOne night, Kenny follows Sylvie to her AA meeting. He interrupts the meeting and berates her for abandoning him in prison. She gets up and leaves, but Kenny follows her out. After a brief fight outside, Kenny relents and invites Sylvie to Christmas dinner at his house with his mother and Dave. Sylvie says she will think about it; Dave secretly watches the scene unfold from his car. Later, as Dave and Sylvie search for an apartment together, Sylvie tells Dave that Kenny invited her to Christmas dinner. Dave tells her that she must come, insisting that Kenny will find it strange if she doesn't.\n\nAt the Christmas dinner at Mariette's house, Kenny tries to pour Dave a glass of wine, but Dave tells him that he is now sober, which upsets Kenny. Mariette pulls Dave aside later and asks him when he is going to tell Kenny that Sylvie is pregnant with his child; Dave avoids the question. Later, Kenny invites Dave to come with him to the club where Sylvie works.\n\nAt the club, Dave tries to tell Kenny about the situation with Sylvie, but Kenny gets distracted watching Sylvie; he thinks she is flirting with her boss, Chalid. Kenny goes to confront Chalid and insults him, eventually beating him up after Chalid suggests that Kenny can no longer properly take care of Sylvie. As Kenny leaves the bar, he tries to apologize to Sylvie, but she rebuffs his apology, telling Kenny that she stopped visiting him in prison because he only reminded her of all the mistakes she'd made in her life.\n\nThe next day, while Kenny is at work at the car wash, he gets attacked by two of Chalid's goons. Kenny manages to overpower them, but Robert sees the fight and fires both Dave and Kenny. That night, Kenny borrows Dave's car and uses it to follow Sylvie after work. Again, he sees her talking with Chalid. Immediately after, Dave gets a phone call from Kenny and meets him in a parking garage. Kenny has a body in the trunk and needs Dave's help to dispose of it; Kenny claims that he tried to stand up to Chalid but that Chalid fell and cracked his head. Kenny says that his cellmate from prison, Stefan (Jan Bijvoet) is going to help them dispose of the body; Dave is reluctant to help, until Kenny threatens to tell the police that Dave was his accomplice in the robbery that got him arrested years ago.\n\nKenny and Dave drive out to [[the Ardennes]], with the body still in the trunk of Dave's car. They meet Joyce ([[Sam Louwyck]]), Stefan's transvestite lover, who brings them to Stefan's property - a trailer in the middle of the forest. At Stefan's trailer, Kenny and Stefan snort cocaine off a knife while Joyce makes them pancakes. The gamekeeper for the forest, G\u00e9rard ([[Eric Godon]]) and his dog, Ricardo, arrive suddenly at Stefan's trailer to inform Stefan that some ostriches have gotten loose and are wandering the countryside. G\u00e9rard tells them that if they encounter an ostrich, they should call him right away, as ostriches can actually be quite violent and dangerous. Ricardo begins to bark at Dave's trunk; G\u00e9rard goes to investigate and sees the body. G\u00e9rard pretends as though he has not seen anything amiss, and gets into his car to go \"warn the other residents\" about the ostriches. However, Kenny knows that G\u00e9rard has seen the body; he grabs the cocaine knife and stabs G\u00e9rard in the neck with it. G\u00e9rard bleeds to death on the ground in front of Kenny and Stefan; Dave, shocked, runs off into the forest.\n\nDave emerges from the forest and hitches a ride to the nearest police station. While waiting to speak to an officer, Kenny arrives and sits down beside him in the lobby. Kenny begs Dave for help disposing of both of the bodies; Kenny promises that if Dave helps, he will leave Dave and Sylvie alone forever. Dave hesitates for a moment but eventually relents and follows Kenny outside the station, where Stefan and Joyce are waiting in separate cars. Kenny tells Dave to go with Joyce and get G\u00e9rard's body from Stefan's trailer.\n\nAt the trailer, Joyce pulls a gun on Dave. However, before Joyce can kill Dave, he smashes a glass over Joyce's head and they get into a long and brutal fight. Dave eventually gains the upper hand and kills Joyce; he then sets Stefan's trailer on fire, with Joyce's body inside.\n\nMeanwhile, Kenny and Stefan are in a warehouse chopping up G\u00e9rard's corpse. Dave pulls up outside the warehouse, and Kenny and Stefan emerge, thinking that Joyce has returned with Dave's body. To their surprise, Dave emerges from the car holding a gun. Kenny tries to calm Dave down, but he cocks the gun in Kenny's face, intent on killing him. At that moment, two ostriches emerge from the forest and attack Kenny and Dave. Dave shoots at the ostriches, and the gunfire alerts a nearby police officer of their location.\n\nDave manages to scare off the ostriches, but he loses his gun in the scuffle. Stef, who is furious that Dave has killed Joyce, hits Dave with his car; Dave is injured but alive. Stef gets out of the car, wielding a tire iron, and walks towards Dave. Before he can kill him, however, Kenny picks up the gun and shoots Stef in the face, killing him instantly.\n\nAs the sound of police sirens approach in the distance and Dave lies bleeding, Kenny puts the gun against his head, intending to commit suicide. However, just as he is about to pull the trigger, Dave calls Sylvie's cellphone. Her ringtone can be heard coming from somewhere nearby; Kenny takes her phone out of his pocket. Dave stands up, and upon realizing what has happened, opens the trunk of his car. Sure enough, it is not Chalid's body in the trunk, but Sylvie's, lifeless and wrapped in a tarp. Dave attacks Kenny, screaming that Sylvie was pregnant. He crawls on top of Kenny and points the gun at his forehead.\n\nAt that moment, several police cruisers arrive. The officers get out of their vehicles and shout at Dave to drop his weapon. He does not respond, continuing to hold the gun against Kenny's head, and the police eventually shoot him. Kenny is arrested by the police as Dave's body lies next to Sylvie's, illuminated by the light from the police cars.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Janssens (actor)|Kevin Janssens]] as Kenneth\n* {{Interlanguage link|Jeroen Perceval|nl}} as Dave\n* [[Veerle Baetens]] as Sylvie\n* {{Interlanguage link|Jan Bijvoet|nl}} as Stef\n* [[Sam Louwyck]] as Joyce\n* [[Viviane de Muynck]] as Mariette\n* [[Eric Godon]] as G\u00e9rard\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 89th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Belgian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|2586118|The Ardennes}}\n\n{{Belgian submission for Academy Awards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ardennes, The}}\n[[Category:2015 films]]\n[[Category:2010s thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Belgian films]]\n[[Category:Belgian thriller drama films]]\n[[Category:Dutch-language films]]\n[[Category:Magritte Award winners]]\n[[Category:2015 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2015 film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Ardennes\n| image          = The Ardennes (2015).jpg\n| caption        = Film poster\n| director       = [[Robin Pront]]\n| producer       = \n| writer         = Robin Pront\n| starring       = [[Veerle Baetens]]\n| music          = \n| cinematography = [[Robrecht Heyvaert]]\n| editing        = [[Alain Dessauvage]]\n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Film date|2015|9|14|[[2015 Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]]|2015|10|14|Belgium|df=yes}}\n| runtime        = 93 minutes\n| country        = Belgium\n| language       = Dutch\n| gross          = $1.7 million<ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/intl/?page=&wk=2015W42&id=_fDARDENNENTHEARD01|title=D'Ardennen (The Ardennes) |website=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''The Ardennes''''' ({{lang-nl|'''D'Ardennen'''}}) is a 2015 Belgian [[drama film]] directed by [[Robin Pront]].<ref name=\"Gent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmfestival.be/en/movie-blog/the-ardennes-by-robin-pront-to-open-42nd-film-fest-gent/08-07-2015/2676 |title=The Ardennes by Robin Pront to open 42nd Film Fest Gent |accessdate=31 August 2015 |work=Film Fest Gent}}</ref> It was screened in the Discovery section of the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"TIFF\">{{cite web |url=http://tiff.net/festivals/festival15/discovery/the-ardennes |title=The Ardennes |accessdate=31 August 2015 |work=TIFF}}</ref> At the [[6th Magritte Awards]], it received the [[Magritte Award for Best Flemish Film]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moury|first1=Ga\u00eblle|last2=Bradfer|first2=Fabienne|title=Jaco Van Dormael et la Flandre se distinguent aux Magritte du cin\u00e9ma|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1113141/article/culture/cinema/2016-02-05/jaco-van-dormael-et-flandre-se-distinguent-aux-magritte-du-cinema|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=Le Soir|date=7 February 2016|language=French}}</ref> It was selected as the Belgian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]] but it was not nominated.<ref name=\"LP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/123408/20160830/oscar-2017-predictions-belgium-hopes-win-first-tiff-selection-ardennes.htm |title=Oscar 2017 Predictions: Will Belgium win its first Oscar with Toronto selection 'The Ardennes?' |first=Francisco |last=Salazar |work=Latin Post |date=30 August 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Belgium\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/the-ardennes-belgium-best-foreign-language-academy-awards-race-1201848037/ |title=\u2018The Ardennes\u2019 to Represent Belgium in Academy Awards Race |first=Maria | last=Cavassuto |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=30 August 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film opens with Dave (Jeroen Perceval) jumping into a pool, wearing a stocking over his face.
