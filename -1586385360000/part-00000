It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which consisted of a partial skeleton described by [[palaeontologists]] [[Ronan Allain]] and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. Further remains, including teeth, from the site were announced in 2014.\n\n''Ichthyovenator'' is estimated to have been between {{convert|8.5 and 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. The [[spinal column]] of its neck and back were very similar to those of ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] that formed a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back, though the sail of this genus was unusual among other known spinosaurs since it was split in two over the hips, and had a [[sinusoidal]], or wave-like curvature. ''Ichthyovenator'' was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it in the [[Spinosaurinae]]. \n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long and shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its teeth were straight and conical, making them well-adapted for feeding mostly on aquatic prey and small animals. Spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place]]The first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]]. These bones were recovered from a [[red sandstone]] layer, within a surface area of less than two metres squared.

The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#centrum|centra]] (bodies of the vertebrae) of the sacrals are largely incomplete due to erosion, but preserved all their accompanying spines with their upper edges intact.

All of these features were also present in ''Sigilmassasaurus''.

The rib shaft was strongly curved, forming a half circle. The lower end of the rib was slightly expanded both sideways and to the front and back. This condition differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods. This suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n<nowiki/>[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|Casts of the holotype vertebrae and additional vertebrae found in 2014 at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]Like most other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two, and had a [[sinusoid]] (sine wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genus ''[[Suchomimus]]'', which had a singular sail that peaked in height over the hips, and [[Baryonyx|B''aryonyx'']], which had much lower dorsal vertebrae. The preserved [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||adj=on|abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest extending from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|Life [[Paleoart|restoration]]]]The sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and back edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (lateral processes for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than with any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis has an L-shape, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches.

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which consisted of a partial skeleton described by [[palaeontologists]] [[Ronan Allain]] and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]].

The [[spinal column]] of its neck and back were very similar to those of ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] that formed a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back, though the sail of this genus was unusual among other known spinosaurs since it was split in two over the hips, and had a [[sinusoidal]], or wave-like curvature. ''Ichthyovenator'' was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it in the [[Spinosaurinae]]. \n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long and shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its teeth were straight and conical, making them well-adapted for feeding mostly on aquatic prey and small animals. Spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place]]The first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]].

The rib shaft was strongly curved, forming a half circle. The lower end of the rib was slightly expanded both sideways and to the front and back. This condition differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods. This suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n<nowiki/>[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|Casts of the holotype vertebrae and additional vertebrae found in 2014 at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]Like most other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two, and had a [[sinusoid]] (sine wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genus ''[[Suchomimus]]'', which had a singular sail that peaked in height over the hips, and [[Baryonyx|B''aryonyx'']], which had much lower dorsal vertebrae. The preserved [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||adj=on|abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest extending from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|Life [[Paleoart|restoration]]]]The sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and back edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (lateral processes for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than with any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis has an L-shape, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches.

[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Welfare in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]].

[[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]]. Covering an area of {{convert|357022|km2|sqmi}}, it lies between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea|North]] seas to the north, and the [[Alps]] to the south. It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, and [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.\n\nVarious [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was documented before AD 100. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the 16th century, [[Northern Germany|northern German regions]] became the centre of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After World War I and the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|revolution of 1918\u201319]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], World War II, and the [[Holocaust]]. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] and the European Union. The country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].\n\nToday, Germany is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republic]] led by a [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|chancellor]]. With 83 million inhabitants of its 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], it is the [[List of European countries by population|second-most populous]] country in Europe after [[Russia]], as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Berlin]], and its financial centre is [[Frankfurt]]; the largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]].\n\nGermany is a [[great power]] with [[Economy of Germany|a strong economy]]; it has the [[List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|largest economy in Europe]], the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fifth-largest by PPP]]. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's [[List of countries by exports|third-largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|importer]] of goods. A [[Developed country|highly developed country]] with a [[List of countries by Human Development Index|very high standard of living]], it offers [[Welfare in Germany|social security]] and a [[Healthcare in Germany|universal health care]] system, environmental protections, and a [[Higher education in Germany|tuition-free university education]]. Germany is also a member of the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[G7]], the [[G20]], and the [[OECD]].

NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and at the [[White House]] when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting [[social network|networking]] [[seminar]]s for state [[executive (government)|executive branch]] officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and [[best practices]] on issues that range from [[education]] and [[public health|health]] to [[technology]], [[welfare reform]], and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. NGA also provides [[management]] and technical assistance to both new and [[incumbent]] governors.\n\nNGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA [[Chairman|chair]] alternates yearly between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is [[List of Governors of Maryland|Governor]] [[Larry Hogan]] of [[Maryland]], a Republican. The vice chair is [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], a Democrat.\n\n[[Arkansas]]' [[Bill Clinton]] is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become [[president of the United States]]. [[Janet Napolitano]] of [[Arizona]] became the first female chair in 2006.\n\nIn February 2020, [[Mike Pompeo]] warned the National Governors Association that the [[Communist Party of China]] was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Allen-Ebrahimian|first=Bethany|url=https://www.axios.com/china-rating-us-governors-bff6cc73-e485-44f2-98d0-b7639af3f0aa.html|title=How a Chinese think tank rates all 50 U.S. governors|date=February 19, 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|access-date=February 19, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Chairs==\nFormally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row.<ref name=\"GovsTime\">{{cite web |url=http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |title=Historical Timeline |publisher=National Governors Association Centennial |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121004103801/http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Years\n!Chair\n!State\n!Party\n|- bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n|1908\u20131911\n|[[Augustus E.

NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and at the [[White House]] when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting [[social network|networking]] [[seminar]]s for state [[executive (government)|executive branch]] officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and [[best practices]] on issues that range from [[education]] and [[public health|health]] to [[technology]], [[welfare reform]], and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. NGA also provides [[management]] and technical assistance to both new and [[incumbent]] governors.\n\nNGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA [[Chairman|chair]] alternates yearly between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is [[List of Governors of Maryland|Governor]] [[Larry Hogan]] of [[Maryland]], a Republican. The vice chair is [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], a Democrat.\n\n[[Arkansas]]' [[Bill Clinton]] is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become [[president of the United States]]. [[Janet Napolitano]] of [[Arizona]] became the first female chair in 2006.\n\nIn February 2020, [[Mike Pompeo]] warned the National Governors Association that the [[Communist Party of China]] was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Allen-Ebrahimian|first=Bethany|url=https://www.axios.com/china-rating-us-governors-bff6cc73-e485-44f2-98d0-b7639af3f0aa.html|title=How a Chinese think tank rates all 50 U.S. governors|date=February 19, 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|access-date=February 19, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Chairs==\nFormally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row.<ref name=\"GovsTime\">{{cite web |url=http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |title=Historical Timeline |publisher=National Governors Association Centennial |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121004103801/http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Years\n!Chair\n!State\n!Party\n|- bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n|1908\u20131911\n|[[Augustus E.

Their first video game did not come until 1994, when they released ''[[King's Field (video game)|King's Field]]'' as a launch title for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|title=The History of From Software|first=Todd|last=Ciolek|date=March 16, 2015|website=ign.com|accessdate=April 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318103835/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|archive-date=March 18, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game did not see a release in North America, although a 1995 sequel would later be released in North America bearing the same title, which was released as ''[[King's Field II]]'' in Japan. After releasing a third title in that series, FromSoftware moved on to release ''[[Echo Night]]'' as well as ''[[Shadow Tower]]'' in 1998. IGN would later note that the latter was \"effectively a ''King's Field'' follow-up\" as it shared many of the gameplay conventions with it. Also during this time FromSoftware would release ''[[Armored Core]]'', the first in a [[mech]] game series which would go on to spawn many sequels.<ref name=ignhistory>{{cite web|last1=Ciolek|first1=Todd|title=The History of From Software|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|website=IGN|accessdate=May 20, 2017|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318103835/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|archive-date=March 18, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The making of ''Armored Core'' solidified the company's development skills, and in July, 1999, they released the multiplayer action game ''[[Frame Gride]]'' for the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/company_history.html|title=Historty {{!}} FromSoftware|website=www.fromsoftware.jp|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[PlayStation 2]] was launched in 2000, FromSoftware supported the system with two RPGs ''[[Eternal Ring]]'', which like the ''King's Field'' series is a first person RPG, and ''[[Evergrace]]'', a more conventional action RPG viewed from a third person perspective.<ref name=ignhistory/> In addition to these titles, FromSoftware published ''[[Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven]]'', a [[stealth game]] that combines action and adventure elements.<ref name=\":0\" /> The company also released a pair of sequels to their PlayStation 1 offerings with ''[[King's Field IV]]'' and ''[[Shadow Tower Abyss]]''.<ref name=ignhistory/> FromSoftware also released the ''Lost Kingdom'' titles for the [[Gamecube]], a competing sixth generation console.<ref name=ignhistory/> IGN would note however that during this generation FromSoftware's focus would shift from RPGs to mech games due in part to the success of the ''Armored Core'' series. In 2002, FromSoftware released the mech action game ''[[Murakumo: Renegade Mech Pursuit]]'' for the [[Xbox]] before entering the mobile game market, where they released another ''King's Field'' title.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2004, they released another Xbox title, ''[[Metal Wolf Chaos]].''

and ''Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice'', that lack difficulty settings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vgr.com/fromsoftware-explains-why-its-games-dont-have-difficulty-levels/|title=FromSoftware Explains Why Its Games Don\u2019t Have Difficulty Levels|last=VGR|date=2018-06-19|website=VGR|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], the President of FromSoftware, justified the lack of difficulty settings, stating, \"We don't want to include a difficulty selection because we want to bring everyone to the same level of discussion and the same level of enjoyment. So we want everyone...to first face that challenge and to overcome it in some way that suits them as a player. We want everyone to feel that sense of accomplishment. We want everyone to feel elated and to join that discussion on the same level. We feel if there's different difficulties, that's going to segment and fragment the user base. People will have different experiences based on that [differing difficulty level]. This is something we take to heart when we design games. It's been the same way for previous titles and it's very much the same with ''Sekiro''.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/}}\n\n{{FromSoftware games}}\n{{Kadokawa Dwango}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1986 establishments in Japan]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Corporation subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Japanese brands]]\n[[Category:Video game companies of Japan]]\n[[Category:Video game companies established in 1986]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = FromSoftware, Inc.\n| logo = Fromsoftware logo.svg\n| native_name = {{nowrap|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30d5\u30ed\u30e0\u30fb\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2}}\n| native_name_lang = ja\n| romanized_name = Kabushiki gaisha furomu sofutowea\n| type = {{ubl|[[Kabushiki gaisha]]|subsidiary}}\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1986|11|1}}\n| hq_location_city = Tokyo\n| hq_location_country = Japan\n| key_people = {{ubl|[[Hidetaka Miyazaki]]|{{small|([[President (corporate title)|President]])}}<ref name=\"company_info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/company_about.html|title=Company|accessdate=May 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504121022/http://fromsoftware.jp/ww/company_about.html|archive-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>|Masanori Takeuchi|{{small|(Senior Managing Director)}}<ref name=\"company_info\"/>}}\n| industry = [[Video game industry|Video games]]\n| products = {{ubl|''[[King's Field]]''|''[[Armored Core]]''|''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]''|''[[Bloodborne]]|''|''[[Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice]]''}}\n| num_employees = 288\n| num_employees_year = 2019<ref name=\"company_info\"/>\n| parent = [[Kadokawa Corporation]]\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/}}\n}}\n\n'''FromSoftware, Inc.''' is a Japanese [[video game development]] company founded in November 1986.

After releasing a third title in that series, FromSoftware moved on to release ''[[Echo Night]]'' as well as ''[[Shadow Tower]]'' in 1998. IGN would later note that the latter was \"effectively a ''King's Field'' follow-up\" as it shared many of the gameplay conventions with it. Also during this time FromSoftware would release ''[[Armored Core]]'', the first in a [[mech]] game series which would go on to spawn many sequels.<ref name=ignhistory>{{cite web|last1=Ciolek|first1=Todd|title=The History of From Software|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|website=IGN|accessdate=May 20, 2017|page=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318103835/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/the-history-of-from-software|archive-date=March 18, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The making of ''Armored Core'' solidified the company's development skills, and in July, 1999, they released the multiplayer action game ''[[Frame Gride]]'' for the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/company_history.html|title=Historty {{!}} FromSoftware|website=www.fromsoftware.jp|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[PlayStation 2]] was launched in 2000, FromSoftware supported the system with two RPGs ''[[Eternal Ring]]'', which like the ''King's Field'' series is a first person RPG, and ''[[Evergrace]]'', a more conventional action RPG viewed from a third person perspective.<ref name=ignhistory/> In addition to these titles, FromSoftware published ''[[Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven]]'', a [[stealth game]] that combines action and adventure elements.<ref name=\":0\" /> The company also released a pair of sequels to their PlayStation 1 offerings with ''[[King's Field IV]]'' and ''[[Shadow Tower Abyss]]''.<ref name=ignhistory/> FromSoftware also released the ''Lost Kingdom'' titles for the [[Gamecube]], a competing sixth generation console.<ref name=ignhistory/> IGN would note however that during this generation FromSoftware's focus would shift from RPGs to mech games due in part to the success of the ''Armored Core'' series.

and ''Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice'', that lack difficulty settings.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vgr.com/fromsoftware-explains-why-its-games-dont-have-difficulty-levels/|title=FromSoftware Explains Why Its Games Don\u2019t Have Difficulty Levels|last=VGR|date=2018-06-19|website=VGR|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], the President of FromSoftware, justified the lack of difficulty settings, stating, \"We don't want to include a difficulty selection because we want to bring everyone to the same level of discussion and the same level of enjoyment. So we want everyone...to first face that challenge and to overcome it in some way that suits them as a player. We want everyone to feel that sense of accomplishment. We want everyone to feel elated and to join that discussion on the same level. We feel if there's different difficulties, that's going to segment and fragment the user base. People will have different experiences based on that [differing difficulty level]. This is something we take to heart when we design games. It's been the same way for previous titles and it's very much the same with ''Sekiro''.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/}}\n\n{{FromSoftware games}}\n{{Kadokawa Dwango}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1986 establishments in Japan]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Corporation subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Japanese brands]]\n[[Category:Video game companies of Japan]]\n[[Category:Video game companies established in 1986]]\n[[Category:Video game development companies]]\n[[Category:Video game publishers]]\n", "name_user": "33hans33", "label": "safe", "comment": "Italicized a game.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FromSoftware"}

Its peak magnitude was estimated to be around 1<ref>{{cite web |title=Brightest comets in the last two-thirds century |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/brightest.html |website=www.icq.eps.harvard.edu |date=November 17, 2013}}</ref> and it has been characterised as a [[great comet]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richter |first1=N. |title=II Cometary physics and the comets Arend-Roland and Mrkos |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=January 1960 |volume=3 |pages=132\u2013137 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(60)90013-1}}</ref>\n\n== Observations ==\nThe comet was discovered by Czech astronomer Antonin Mrkos by [[naked eye]], at the observatory on [[Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. He announced its discovery on August 2, 1957 and by that point it was already discovered independently by others. However, the comet became known as comet Mrkos.

The tail of the comet was estimated to be more than 5 degrees long. The comet had two tails, one that at the start was brighter and curved, and a straight one with knots that became brighter at the end of August and showed rapid changes in appearance. The comet remained visible by naked eye until the end of September.<ref name=\"Porter\"/>\n\nBy the end of October 1957, the comet had moved again close to the sun and wasn't observable.

It was one of the two bright comets that had their perihelion in 1957, the other being [[Comet Arend\u2013Roland]]. Its peak magnitude was estimated to be around 1<ref>{{cite web |title=Brightest comets in the last two-thirds century |url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/brightest.html |website=www.icq.eps.harvard.edu |date=November 17, 2013}}</ref> and it has been characterised as a [[great comet]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richter |first1=N. |title=II Cometary physics and the comets Arend-Roland and Mrkos |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=January 1960 |volume=3 |pages=132\u2013137 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(60)90013-1}}</ref>\n\n== Observations ==\nThe comet was discovered by Czech astronomer Antonin Mrkos by [[naked eye]], at observatory on [[Lomnick\u00fd \u0161t\u00edt]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. He announced its discovery on August 2, 1957 and by that point it was already discovered independently by others. However, the comet became known as comet Mrkos. The comet was then near perihelion and its [[apparent magnitude]] was estimated to be around 2.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite journal |last1=Porter |first1=J.G. |title=I Arend-Roland (1956h) and Mrkos (1957d) |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=January 1960 |volume=3 |pages=128\u2013132 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(60)90012-X}}</ref>\n\nThe comet gradually moved away of the sun and became a conspicuous object visible after the sunset. The tail of the comet was estimated to be more than 5 degrees long. The comet had two tails, one that at the start was brighter and curved, and a straight one with knots that became brighter at the end of August and showed rapid changes in appearance. The comet remained visible by naked eye until the end of September.<ref name=\"Porter\"/>\n\nBy the end of October 1957, the comet had moved again close to the sun and wasn't observable. It was recovered at the end of January 1958 and it was last observed on July 9, 1958, when it was photographed as a 19 magnitude diffuse object.<ref name=\"Porter\"/>\n\nObservation of the comet revealed the presence of [[sodium]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vainu Bappu |first1=M.
