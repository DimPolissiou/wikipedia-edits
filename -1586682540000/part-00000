In 1939, he entered [[Yaba College|Higher College Yaba]], studying medicine. Most of the students that went to [[Government College Umuahia]] went on to Yaba College which was the only science-based institution of higher learning at the time. Nwokolo's medical course lasted seven years including internship, with the General Hospital [[Lagos]] and [[Aba, Abia|Aba]] General Hospital as teaching hospitals. Nwokolo qualified as a medical doctor in 1946, and consequently got the LMS: Licenciate of the School of Medicine.and won the Walter Johnson prize in public health.\n\n==Early career==\n===Pioneer Medical Officer===\nAfter his internship at [[Lagos]] General Hospital, Nwokolo was posted from 1947 to 1949 at General Hospital [[Enugu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/127563/savage |title= Savage \u2013 Death Announcements |publisher= Telegraph Media Group |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4053?rss=1 |title= Dora Janet Burman Savage |publisher= BMJ |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, as the [[University of Ibadan|University College Ibadan]] was opening its teaching hospital temporarily at the Ibadan [[Adeoyo Hospital]], the University made a request to the government for junior doctors to work as house officers.

He then became a senior house physician in the [[geriatrics]] unit of [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup]]. There, Nwokolo worked towards getting his MRCP: [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nIn 1952, Nwokolo moved to [[Edinburgh]] to prepare further for the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]]. He attended lectures and tutorials of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and clinics of some consultants. Early in 1953, Nwokolo took the MRCP examination,.He was one of the very few Africans to obtain such a MRCP: Membership of the Royal College of Physicians qualification, and the second Nigerian to do so: the first being Dr. Olu Mabayoje.[http://nigeriavillagesquare.com/forum/books-creative-writing/472-ogunlesi-medicine-my-passport.html] Armed with the MRCP, Nwokolo went back to his former [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup]], London. There, he served as a physician returned to Nigeria \u2013 as a specialist in [[internal medicine]] \u2013 just on time for his marriage to Njideka Priscilla Nwokolo: n\u00e9e: Okonkwo \u2013 on Saturday 4 July 1953.\n\n===Civil service===\nWhen he came back from London, Nwokolo returned to the civil service. He was appointed a special grade medical officer. Reorganisation in the service enabled all assistant medical officers to become medical officers after serving a period of one year as house officers. Nwokolo did one year house job in Ibadan before going to the United Kingdom for specialist medical qualification. He also did another year of house jobs in [[Dover]] after his highly successful conjoint [[Licentiate (degree)|LRCP]] and MRCP examination.\n\nWith his senior house officer appointment and post MRCP working experience in the United Kingdom, Nwokolo earned his designation as a full medical officer on special grade. General Hospital [[Enugu]] was where he mainly served. Nwokolo had his extramural private practice in his home in the evenings. He was in charge of medical wards where in-patients were admitted and treated.\n\n===Research===\nNwokolo carried out medical research in the wards as well as in the field. He did major research in [[endomyocardial fibrosis]], [[endemic goitre]], [[sickle-cell disease]] and other areas of national need. Fieldwork was usually done during weekends, and included travelling in his car to different locations in [[Eastern Nigeria]] plus Northern and [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Nigeria]], as well as to [[Obudu]]. Nwokolo published about nine papers based on his research while in the civil service. On the strength of his research and papers, he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (F.R.C.P.) in 1960, based on recommendations by his boss: professor Alexander Brown and professor Harold Scaborough, a visiting scholar from [[University of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/3946 |title=Harold Scarborough |publisher= Royal College of Physicians of London |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref> Nwokolo was also invited to teach as senior lecturer at University College Ibadan by professor Brown. In addition, working with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], professor Brown recommended Nwokolo for a research fellowship in [[gastroenterology]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].\n\n===Rockefeller Foundation fellowship===\nFor his 1963 to 1964 [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship at Minnesota, Nwokolo was assigned to the [[gastroenterology]] unit under James Carey,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123051/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/56979/1/CommitteeAssignments1962-1963.pdf</ref> chief of gastroenterology.  On completing his   fellowship, Nwokolo followed the same shipping route back. He briefly stopped in the United Kingdom, where he was honoured as an [[Edinburgh]] \"Free Man of the City\" and presented with the \"Key to the City of Edinburgh\" [[Scotland]] as a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]].\n\n==Career==\n===Gastroenterology department founding===\nAfter his return from the United States, Nwokolo was appointed associate professor of medicine. Subsequently, he set up a sub department of gastroenterology, with senior registrar Dr. Lewis. Nwokolo led research on various gastro-intestinal problems using intestinal biopsies and procedures he learnt in the United States at [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s9AJAQAAMAAJ&q=Nwokolo |title=Ogunlesi \u2013 Medicine: My Passport |publisher= Spectrum Books |accessdate= 1 June 2014|isbn=9789780294595 |year=2003 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil War in Nigeria===\nIn 1966, before the [[Nigerian civil war]] with [[Biafra]] broke out in 1967, with hostilities and killing of [[Igbo people]] rising, Nwokolo left [[Ibadan]] for Enugu with his wife and children. The political mood in Enugu at the arrival of the returnees from all parts of Nigeria was that of shock and awareness of danger. In Enugu, thousands of corpses and maimed and half dead, deprived, devastated and homeless refugees were pouring in from [[Northern Nigeria]], without any hope of accommodation or food and nourishment. Things even soon got so agonising as civil war eventually broke out between [[Nigeria]] and [[Biafra]].\n\n===Medical school establishment===\nFor those, such as Nwokolo, who escaped from [[Ibadan]] and Western Nigeria, the experience was so terrible that twenty-one specialist doctors mainly from Ibadan and [[Lagos]] met and resolved to establish a University Teaching Hospital in Enugu. At the meeting were doctors: Nwokolo, Onuaguluchi, [[Fabian Udekwu|Udekwu]], Nwako, Nwachukwu, Eziashi, Ikeme, Udeh, Ogan, Uche, Okoro, Kaine, Udeozor, Okafor, Njoku-Obi, Ifekwunigwe, and others. Through Dr. Nlogha Okeke plus permanent secretary and chief secretary to the government: chief Onyegbula, approval was rapidly obtained from the military governor: [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]] to open a teaching hospital with Enugu General Hospital as base. Ojukwu also approved swift establishment of the faculty of medicine, headed by professor Kodilinye, while Nwokolo became the first head of the department of medicine and associate dean of medicine at the new medical school.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url= http://www2.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/modbiomed/Publications/wit_vols/44832.pdf |title= British Contributions to Medical Research and Education in Africa after the Second World War Page 49 |publisher= Queen Mary University of London |access-date= 31 May 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201534/http://www2.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/modbiomed/Publications/wit_vols/44832.pdf |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nNwokolo continued to work as head of the department of medicine of the university teaching hospital which had moved to [[Awka-Etiti]] when Enugu was threatened during the civil war. Nwokolo also carried out research especially relevant to the terrible war conditions of starvation and [[malnutrition]]. He toured churches and public gatherings to educate the people on nutrition and feeding for survival. Several [[mimeograph]]ed papers were produced and distributed for public education. When the [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended in 1970, Nwokolo and family returned to Enugu, and found their house looted and the top floor completely razed by fire. He had to do some extensive rebuilding.\n\nWith the approval of the Nigerian Federal Government for the re-opening of the [[University of Nigeria Nsukka]], Nwokolo returned to his position as head of the department of medicine. He was appointed full professor in 1971. Accordingly, renowned Welsh academic, professor [[Eldryd Parry]], who previously served at [[University College Hospital, Ibadan]] from 1960, affirms that Nwokolo led and facilitated the establishment of medical schools in Enugu and Nsukka.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nNwokolo was an advisor for the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Endemic paragonimiasis in Africa |publisher= Bulletin: World Health Organization |pmc=2481166 | pmid=4549201 |volume=50 |issue=6 |year=1974 |journal=Bull.

In 1939, he entered [[Yaba College|Higher College Yaba]], studying medicine. Most of the students that went to [[Government College Umuahia]] went on to Yaba College which was the only science-based institution of higher learning at the time. Nwokolo's medical course lasted seven years including internship, with the General Hospital [[Lagos]] and [[Aba, Abia|Aba]] General Hospital as teachign hospitals. Nwokolo qualified as a medical doctor in 1946, and consequently got the LMS: Licenciate of the School of Medicine.and won the Walter Johnson prize in public health.\n\n==Early career==\n===Pioneer Medical Officer===\nAfter his internship at [[Lagos]] General Hospital, Nwokolo was posted from 1947 to 1949 at General Hospital [[Enugu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/127563/savage |title= Savage \u2013 Death Announcements |publisher= Telegraph Media Group |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e4053?rss=1 |title= Dora Janet Burman Savage |publisher= BMJ |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, as the [[University of Ibadan|University College Ibadan]] was opening its teaching hospital temporarily at the Ibadan [[Adeoyo Hospital]], the University made a request to the government for junior doctors to work as house officers. Nwokolo was the first of such assistant medical officers to be seconded in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uch-ibadan.org.ng/Medicine |title= Brief History of the Department |publisher= University College Hospital Ibadan |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref> Nwokolo worked in the department of medicine at the University College Hospital from 1949 to 1950, and subsequently proceeded to London, uplifted with a professional letter of recommendation from professor Alexander Brown.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s9AJAQAAMAAJ |title= Medicine: My Passport by Professor Theophilus Oladipo Ogunlesi |accessdate= 1 June 2014|isbn= 9789780294595 |last1= Ogunlesi |first1= T.

He then became a senior house physician in the [[geriatrics]] unit of [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup]]. There, Nwokolo worked towards getting his MRCP: [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]].\n\nIn 1952, Nwokolo moved to [[Edinburgh]] to prepare further for the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]]. He attended lectures and tutorials of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and clinics of some consultants. Early in 1953, Nwokolo took the MRCP examination,.He was one of the very few Africans to obtain such a MRCP: Membership of the Royal College of Physicians qualification, and the second Nigerian to do so: the first being Dr. Olu Mabayoje.[http://nigeriavillagesquare.com/forum/books-creative-writing/472-ogunlesi-medicine-my-passport.html] Armed with the MRCP, Nwokolo went back to his former [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup]], London. There, he served as a physician returned to Nigeria \u2013 as a specialist in [[internal medicine]] \u2013 just on time for his marriage to Njideka Priscilla Nwokolo: n\u00e9e: Okonkwo \u2013 on Saturday 4 July 1953.\n\n===Civil service===\nWhen he came back from London, Nwokolo returned to the civil service. He was appointed a special grade medical officer. Reorganisation in the service enabled all assistant medical officers to become medical officers after serving a period of one year as house officers. Nwokolo did one year house job in Ibadan before going to the United Kingdom for specialist medical qualification. He also did another year of house jobs in [[Dover]] after his highly successful conjoint [[Licentiate (degree)|LRCP]] and MRCP examination.\n\nWith his senior house officer appointment and post MRCP working experience in the United Kingdom, Nwokolo earned his designation as a full medical officer on special grade. General Hospital [[Enugu]] was where he mainly served. Nwokolo had his extramural private practice in his home in the evenings. He was in charge of medical wards where in-patients were admitted and treated.\n\n===Research===\nNwokolo carried out medical research in the wards as well as in the field. He did major research in [[endomyocardial fibrosis]], [[endemic goitre]], [[sickle-cell disease]] and other areas of national need. Fieldwork was usually done during weekends, and included travelling in his car to different locations in [[Eastern Nigeria]] plus Northern and [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Nigeria]], as well as to [[Obudu]]. Nwokolo published about nine papers based on his research while in the civil service. On the strength of his research and papers, he was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (F.R.C.P.) in 1960, based on recommendations by his boss: professor Alexander Brown and professor Harold Scaborough, a visiting scholar from [[University of Wales]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/3946 |title=Harold Scarborough |publisher= Royal College of Physicians of London |accessdate= 1 June 2014}}</ref> Nwokolo was also invited to teach as senior lecturer at University College Ibadan by professor Brown. In addition, working with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], professor Brown recommended Nwokolo for a research fellowship in [[gastroenterology]] at the [[University of Minnesota]].\n\n===Rockefeller Foundation fellowship===\nFor his 1963 to 1964 [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship at Minnesota, Nwokolo was assigned to the [[gastroenterology]] unit under James Carey,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123051/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/56979/1/CommitteeAssignments1962-1963.pdf</ref> chief of gastroenterology.  On completing his   fellowship, Nwokolo followed the same shipping route back. He briefly stopped in the United Kingdom, where he was honoured as an [[Edinburgh]] \"Free Man of the City\" and presented with the \"Key to the City of Edinburgh\" [[Scotland]] as a fellow of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]].\n\n==Career==\n===Gastroenterology department founding===\nAfter his return from the United States, Nwokolo was appointed associate professor of medicine. Subsequently, he set up a sub department of gastroenterology, with senior registrar Dr. Lewis. Nwokolo led research on various gastro-intestinal problems using intestinal biopsies and procedures he learnt in the United States at [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=s9AJAQAAMAAJ&q=Nwokolo |title=Ogunlesi \u2013 Medicine: My Passport |publisher= Spectrum Books |accessdate= 1 June 2014|isbn=9789780294595 |year=2003 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil War in Nigeria===\nIn 1966, before the [[Nigerian civil war]] with [[Biafra]] broke out in 1967, with hostilities and killing of [[Igbo people]] rising, Nwokolo left [[Ibadan]] for Enugu with his wife and children. The political mood in Enugu at the arrival of the returnees from all parts of Nigeria was that of shock and awareness of danger. In Enugu, thousands of corpses and maimed and half dead, deprived, devastated and homeless refugees were pouring in from [[Northern Nigeria]], without any hope of accommodation or food and nourishment. Things even soon got so agonising as civil war eventually broke out between [[Nigeria]] and [[Biafra]].\n\n===Medical school establishment===\nFor those, such as Nwokolo, who escaped from [[Ibadan]] and Western Nigeria, the experience was so terrible that twenty-one specialist doctors mainly from Ibadan and [[Lagos]] met and resolved to establish a University Teaching Hospital in Enugu. At the meeting were doctors: Nwokolo, Onuaguluchi, [[Fabian Udekwu|Udekwu]], Nwako, Nwachukwu, Eziashi, Ikeme, Udeh, Ogan, Uche, Okoro, Kaine, Udeozor, Okafor, Njoku-Obi, Ifekwunigwe, and others. Through Dr. Nlogha Okeke plus permanent secretary and chief secretary to the government: chief Onyegbula, approval was rapidly obtained from the military governor: [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu]] to open a teaching hospital with Enugu General Hospital as base. Ojukwu also approved swift establishment of the faculty of medicine, headed by professor Kodilinye, while Nwokolo became the first head of the department of medicine and associate dean of medicine at the new medical school.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url= http://www2.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/modbiomed/Publications/wit_vols/44832.pdf |title= British Contributions to Medical Research and Education in Africa after the Second World War Page 49 |publisher= Queen Mary University of London |access-date= 31 May 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201534/http://www2.history.qmul.ac.uk/research/modbiomed/Publications/wit_vols/44832.pdf |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nNwokolo continued to work as head of the department of medicine of the university teaching hospital which had moved to [[Awka-Etiti]] when Enugu was threatened during the civil war. Nwokolo also carried out research especially relevant to the terrible war conditions of starvation and [[malnutrition]]. He toured churches and public gatherings to educate the people on nutrition and feeding for survival. Several [[mimeograph]]ed papers were produced and distributed for public education. When the [[Nigerian Civil War]] ended in 1970, Nwokolo and family returned to Enugu, and found their house looted and the top floor completely razed by fire. He had to do some extensive rebuilding.\n\nWith the approval of the Nigerian Federal Government for the re-opening of the [[University of Nigeria Nsukka]], Nwokolo returned to his position as head of the department of medicine. He was appointed full professor in 1971. Accordingly, renowned Welsh academic, professor [[Eldryd Parry]], who previously served at [[University College Hospital, Ibadan]] from 1960, affirms that Nwokolo led and facilitated the establishment of medical schools in Enugu and Nsukka.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nNwokolo was an advisor for the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite journal |title= Endemic paragonimiasis in Africa |publisher= Bulletin: World Health Organization |pmc=2481166 | pmid=4549201 |volume=50 |issue=6 |year=1974 |journal=Bull.

The monastery became a site noted for its learning for a millennium after its founding. The only visible sign remaining of this are the ruins of the [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] built in the 10th Century. However, an archaeological survey in 2001 found traces of monastic buildings beneath the road. These were a chapel and three support buildings which were constructed from wood, had thatched roofs and wall made of clay or wattle. This site was on either side of the road and centred around Killoughternane Cross. The survey also found indications that before the building of the now ruined oratory it was the site of an earlier 8th century timber-framed church which wasthe same length as the ruined oratory but was considerably wider. They also discovered a Neolithic burial beneath the oratory. The survey found that there was as many as 25 buildings on the site at Killoughternane.<ref name = igp>{{cite web |url = http://www.igp-web.com/Carlow/St_Fortiarnans_church.htm | title = St Fortiarnans Church | accessdate = 27 March 2020 | publisher = Irish Genealogy Projects}}</ref>  \n\nThe monastery had a round tower which was located to the north west of the Oratory's eastern wall at a distance of about 20 yards, it had a height of {{convert|96|ft|m}} and was destroyed in the 13th century after it was struck by lightning.

It was built on the remains of a timber church said to have been built by [[Fortiarn\u00e1n]] (Fortchern, Fortcheirn) in the 5th century AD.\n\n==Location==\nKilloughternane Church is located in southern County Carlow, northwest of [[Mount Leinster]] and about 6&nbsp;km northeast of [[Borris, County Carlow|Borris]].<ref name = whitechurch>{{cite web |url = http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/332/Killoughternane.htm | title = 'The White Church' : Church | accessdate = 27 March 2020 | publisher = megalithomania}}</ref>\n\n==History and archaeology==\n[[St Fortichern]], a bishop, one of the smiths of [[St Patrick]] and teachor of [[St Finnian of Clonard]], founded a monastery on this site is the in the 5th Century. The monastery became a site noted for its learning for a millennium after its founding. The only visible sign remaining of this are the ruins of the [[oratory (worship)|oratory]] built in the 10th Century. However, an archaeological survey in 2001 found traces of monastic buildings beneath the road. These were a chapel and three support buildings which were constructed from wood, had thatched roofs and wall made of clay or wattle. This site was on either side of the road and centred around Killoughternane Cross. The survey also found indications that before the building of the now ruined oratory it was the site of an earlier 8th century timber-framed church which wasthe same length as the ruined oratory but was considerably wider. They also discovered a Neolithic burial beneath the oratory. The survey found that there was as many as 25 buildings on the site at Killoughternane.<ref name = igp>{{cite web |url = http://www.igp-web.com/Carlow/St_Fortiarnans_church.htm | title = St Fortiarnans Church | accessdate = 27 March 2020 | publisher = Irish Genealogy Projects}}</ref>  \n\nThe monastery had a round tower which was located to the north west of the Oratory's eastern wall at a distance of about 20 yards, it had a height of {{convert|96|ft|m}} and was destroyed in the 13th century after it was struck by lightning. The monsatery was expanded in the middle ages when a large church was built of stone with a wood shingle roof was contructed along with an infirmary, a dormitory and classrooms. In the 14th Centurt the final buildings were added, again of stone, and these were a lecture hall, a washroom and a residence.<ref name = igp/>\n\n==The building==\nThe church is made of local hammer-dressed [[granite]], with walls 80&nbsp;cm (2\u2154 ft) thick.

He currently is an entrepreneur.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n==Racing career==\nMurphy ran two races (at the [[Miami]] street course and [[Road Atlanta]]) in Konrad Motorsports' No. 25 [[Saleen S7R]] in the 2002 [[American Le Mans Series]] season, teaming up with Charles Slater in both races as well as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Yvon]] at Road Atlanta. He also drove for Konrad in one Grand-Am race at the [[Daytona International Speedway #Road courses|Daytona road course]] that year in their No. 31, sharing the car with [[Franz Konrad (racing driver)|Franz Konrad]].\n\nMurphy made his first start in the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] in late [[2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2004]] driving for [[Green Light Racing]] in the No. 07 [[Chevrolet Silverado]]. He had a solid debut, qualifying 19th and finishing 22nd. The deal gave Murphy an opportunity to race for the remaining three races of the season for the team (two races in the No. 07 and one in the No. 08). At the next race at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], Murphy finished 24th, but also led two laps. At [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami]], Murphy led ten laps due to pit strategy before his engine expired.\n\nMurphy ran a total of 14 races in 2005-2006, once again all for Green Light Racing. His best finish was a 13th at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]. He earned his first career lead-lap finish at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]] that year. Also, at Atlanta, Murphy led his only lap on the season. However, sponsorship did not materialize and after the race at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], Green Light found other drivers to drive the truck for the rest of the year.\n\nIn February 2007, Murphy competed in the 41st Annual World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at [[New Smyrna Speedway]] in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]]. Murphy was scheduled to race in three races that took place on consecutive nights. Murphy qualified on the pole for the Thursday night race, but rain and thunder caused that night's activities to be canceled. On Friday night, Murphy qualified on the outside pole, but did not start the race due to a mechanical problem with his car. Murphy qualified on the pole for the second time on Saturday, but due to a problem he was forced to start in the rear of the pack. After a long week of frustration and disappointment, the team's hard work finally paid off when Murphy crossed the finish line in 5th place.\n\nMurphy spent 2007 racing with SS Racing and competing for the ASA Super Late Model Challenge Series division title. He was awarded the ASA-Late Model Series Pat Burdow Memorial Rookie of the Year Title on Saturday at [[Five Flags Speedway]]. Murphy qualified with the fastest time for the fourth time and set a new ASALMS track record for the three times during the season (all divisions).\n\nReturning to the No. 07 truck of the renamed SS-Green Light Racing in [[2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2008]], Murphy earned his first and only top-10 in the Truck Series at [[Mansfield Motorsports Park|Mansfield]], which was also his best finish of the season. He drove in five other races after that: [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]], [[Lucas Oil Raceway|IRP]], [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]], and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. \n\nMurphy made his [[Nationwide Series]] debut in [[2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2009]], running three races ([[Iowa Speedway|Iowa]], [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], and [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]]) in the No. 81 Dodge for [[MacDonald Motorsports]]. His best finish was a 20th at Bristol. He continued to compete in the Truck Series for SSGLR, this year in the No. 08 in all his starts (due to [[Chad McCumbee]] driving the No. 07 full-time in 2009). After running three races in that truck, he drove the No. 21 [[Dodge]] for GunBroker Racing at Talladega that year, substituting for [[Nick Tucker]], the normal driver of that truck, who had never raced on a [[restrictor plate]] track before and was not cleared to race that weekend.\n\nHe returned to SS-Green Light again in [[2010 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2010]], driving the No. 07 truck in the season-opener at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]. The team indicated that they wanted him to run the full season if sponsorship could be found,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-truck/news/ss-green-light-racing-names-murphy-for-daytona/2390829/ |title=SS Green Light Racing names Murphy for Daytona |website=Motorsport.com |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref> but it was not. The team ended up having multiple drivers in the No. 07 that year, and that race, which Murphy finished 13th in, ended up being his last start in NASCAR.\n\n==Personal life==\nAlthough he was born in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, Murphy currently resides in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] where he works as an entrepreneur.

He currently is an entrepreneur.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n==Racing career==\nMurphy ran two races (at the [[Miami]] street course and [[Road Atlanta]]) in Konrad Motorsports' No. 25 [[Saleen S7R]] in the 2002 [[American Le Mans Series]] season, teamming up with Charles Slater in both races as well as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Yvon]] at Road Atlanta. He also drove for Konrad in one Grand-Am race at the [[Daytona International Speedway #Road courses|Daytona road course]] that year in their No. 31, sharing the car with [[Franz Konrad (racing driver)|Franz Konrad]].\n\nMurphy made his first start in the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] in late [[2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2004]] driving for [[Green Light Racing]] in the No. 07 [[Chevrolet Silverado]]. He had a solid debut, qualifying 19th and finishing 22nd. The deal gave Murphy an opportunity to race for the remaining three races of the season for the team (two races in the No. 07 and one in the No. 08). At the next race at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], Murphy finished 24th, but also led two laps. At [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami]], Murphy led ten laps due to pit strategy before his engine expired.\n\nMurphy ran a total of 14 races in 2005-2006, once again all for Green Light Racing. His best finish was a 13th at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]. He earned his first career lead-lap finish at [[Auto Club Speedway|Fontana]] that year. Also, at Atlanta, Murphy led his only lap on the season. However, sponsorship did not materialize and after the race at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], Green Light found other drivers to drive the truck for the rest of the year.\n\nIn February 2007, Murphy competed in the 41st Annual World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at [[New Smyrna Speedway]] in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]]. Murphy was scheduled to race in three races that took place on consecutive nights. Murphy qualified on the pole for the Thursday night race, but rain and thunder caused that night's activities to be canceled. On Friday night, Murphy qualified on the outside pole, but did not start the race due to a mechanical problem with his car. Murphy qualified on the pole for the second time on Saturday, but due to a problem he was forced to start in the rear of the pack. After a long week of frustration and disappointment, the team's hard work finally paid off when Murphy crossed the finish line in 5th place.\n\nMurphy spent 2007 racing with SS Racing and competing for the ASA Super Late Model Challenge Series division title. He was awarded the ASA-Late Model Series Pat Burdow Memorial Rookie of the Year Title on Saturday at [[Five Flags Speedway]]. Murphy qualified with the fastest time for the fourth time and set a new ASALMS track record for the three times during the season (all divisions).\n\nReturning to the No. 07 truck of the renamed SS-Green Light Racing in [[2008 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2008]], Murphy earned his first and only top-10 in the Truck Series at [[Mansfield Motorsports Park|Mansfield]], which was also his best finish of the season. He drove in five other races after that: [[Milwaukee Mile|Milwaukee]], [[Lucas Oil Raceway|IRP]], [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]], and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. \n\nMurphy made his [[Nationwide Series]] debut in [[2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2009]], running three races ([[Iowa Speedway|Iowa]], [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]], and [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]]) in the No. 81 Dodge for [[MacDonald Motorsports]]. His best finish was a 20th at Bristol. He continued to compete in the Truck Series for SSGLR, this year in the No. 08 in all his starts (due to [[Chad McCumbee]] driving the No. 07 full-time in 2009). After running three races in that truck, he drove the No. 21 [[Dodge]] for GunBroker Racing at Talladega that year, substituting for [[Nick Tucker]], the normal driver of that truck, who had never raced on a [[restrictor plate]] track before and was not cleared to race that weekend.\n\nHe returned to SS-Green Light again in [[2010 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2010]], driving the No. 07 truck in the season-opener at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]. The team indicated that they wanted him to run the full season if sponsorship could be found,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-truck/news/ss-green-light-racing-names-murphy-for-daytona/2390829/ |title=SS Green Light Racing names Murphy for Daytona |website=Motorsport.com |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2020}}</ref> but it was not. The team ended up having multiple drivers in the No. 07 that year, and that race, which Murphy finished 13th in, ended up being his last start in NASCAR.\n\n==Personal life==\nAlthough he was born in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, Murphy currently resides in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] where he works as an entrepreneur. He graduated from Broward College.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
