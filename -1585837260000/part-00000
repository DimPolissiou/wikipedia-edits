The two releases are linked by the high number of vocal contributions from Death Row Records artists, including [[Tha Dogg Pound]], [[RBX]], [[The Lady of Rage]],<ref name=TheSource/> while both contain a high density of misogynistic lyrics and profanity in their lyrics.<ref name=Stylus-TheChronicVsDoggystyle/> In addition, the two albums are each viewed by critics as early \"G-funk classics\", and have been described as  \"joined at the hip\". 'Doggystyle' also marked the debut of Death Row vocalist, Nanci Fletcher - the daughter of jazz legend Sam Fletcher.<ref name=AMG/><ref name=Stylus-TheChronicVsDoggystyle/>\n\n[[Gangsta rap]] has been criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang violence and black-on-black crime.

He said, \"I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality.\"<ref name=NYTimes-PopMusic/> Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. \"For little kids growing up in the ghettos,\" he said, \"it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves.\"<ref name=NYTimes-PopMusic/> He further explained the \"dream\" that he would pursue after making the album: \"I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence.

Some publications have held the rap genre responsible for social problems such as sexual violence and sexism, which has been blamed on Snoop Doggy Dogg and other rappers for calling their controversial lyrics \"keeping it real.\"<ref name=PimpsUpHosDown>T.

This imagery of the \"gangsta lifestyle\" is thought to have influenced young black males into trying to live the same lifestyle and it is also noted by T. Denean, writer of ''Pimps Up, Ho's Down: Hip Hop's Hold on Young Black Women'', that the videos highlight the representation of class, race and Black masculinity within contemporary urban America.<ref name=AmIBlackEnoughp80>Todd Boyd.

That album is considered to have \"transformed the entire sound of West Coast rap\" by its development of what later became known as the \"[[G-funk]]\" sound.<ref name=AMG-TheChronic>Steve Huey. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r814133|pure_url=yes}} The Chronic > Overview]. Allmusic.

The two releases are linked by the high number of vocal contributions from Death Row Records artists, including [[Tha Dogg Pound]], [[RBX]], [[The Lady of Rage]],<ref name=TheSource/> while both contain a high density of misogynistic lyrics and profanity in their lyrics.<ref name=Stylus-TheChronicVsDoggystyle/> In addition, the two albums are each viewed by critics as early \"G-funk classics\", and have been described as  \"joined at the hip\". 'Doggystyle' also marked the debut of Death Row vocalist, Nanci Fletcher - the daughter of jazz legend Sam Fletcher.<ref name=AMG/><ref name=Stylus-TheChronicVsDoggystyle/>\n\n[[Gangsta rap]] has been criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang violence and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as [[Compton, California]], and [[Long Beach, California]].<ref name=AMG-SOC>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/straight-outta-compton-mw0000653426 | title=Straight Outta Compton \u2013 N.W.A. | publisher=Rovi Corporation | work=AllMusic | accessdate=May 29, 2014 | author=Henderson, Alex}}</ref><ref name=Davemusic>Reference to Alex Henderson's Allmusic review on Dave's music database: [http://whitgunn.freeservers.com/Davemusic/N/NWA/straight-outta-compton.html Straight Outta Compton Reviews]</ref> Describing ''Doggystyle'' in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, and the extent to which it is based on his personal experience.  He said, \"I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality.\"<ref name=NYTimes-PopMusic/> Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. \"For little kids growing up in the ghettos,\" he said, \"it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves.\"<ref name=NYTimes-PopMusic/> He further explained the \"dream\" that he would pursue after making the album: \"I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill\".<ref name=NYTimes-PopMusic>Tour\u00e9 (November 21, 1993).

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, in 1614, James summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32.

Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, in 1614, James summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80-82}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with the Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} That Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this Parliament, is a hypothesis that has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances. The packers, on the other hand, still faced the fury of the Commons for their attempts to undermine the Parliamentary process.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=29}}\n\n===Replay: Impositions and controversy===\n{{quotebox\n|text=My Lords, I think it a dangerous thing for us to confer with them about the point of impositions.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

In general the movement was an overwhelming failure; very few freed slaves wanted to move to Africa, and the small number that did\u2014some under duress\u2014initially faced brutal conditions. As the failure became known in the United States in the 1820s, it spawned and energized the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]]. Liberia and Sierra Leone became independent black countries after Ha\u00efti (January 1st 1804), and became the second and the third of the only three countries founded by former slaves. U.S. Ambassador to Liberia was a coveted position. In the twentieth century [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]], and some other African Americans espoused the concept, but few actually left the United States.\n\n==Background==\nThe question of where free blacks of American birth should reside was not much discussed by white writers in the eighteenth century: \"At the time of the [[American Revolution]], there had been few free blacks anywhere in the country.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Gateway to Freedom.

There was a small number of free blacks who worked and lived in various of the colonies.\n\nPressures for ending slavery began small but grew steadily. Various philosophical and religious condemnations of it, especially by [[Quakers]], were published. Slavery became illegal in the United Kingdom in 1772 by court decision (see [[Somerset v Stewart]]), and in the British colonies by statute in 1838. In France slavery was illegal at least since the sixteenth century, and as part of the [[French Revolution]], it was abolished in French colonies in 1794 (although it was restored from 1802 to 1848). Starting in 1791 the slaves of [[Saint-Domingue]] revolted, gaining their freedom, and established the free Black country of [[History of Haiti|Haiti]]. Starting with Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in 1780, slavery was gradually abolished in all the Northern states, although this did not mean that existing slaves were always freed. (Vermont, which at the time was not part of the United States, abolished slavery in 1777.) By the [[1850 census]] there are no slaves in the [[Slave states and free states|free states]]; there were still hundreds in the [[1840 census]] (and millions in the South). In the South, sometimes influenced by appeals from preachers \u2014 [[abolitionism in the United States]] had a strong religious component \u2014 some individuals freed their slaves, or left in their wills instructions to free them upon their owner's death.\n\nThe number of free Blacks in the new United States skyrocketed, and the question of \"what to do with them\" steadily grew in importance. Even when free, most were not citizens with no legal rights, as the [[Dred Scott]] decision made clear. Usually seen as \"racially\" inferior, few believed them a desirable or even a possible part of American society. They were prohibited from living in some areas, and there was legal discrimination that is astonishing today. (Black passengers on river boats were not allowed in the cabin, but had to stay on deck, whatever the weather. In Florida, each free black man had to have a white man who could be sued for the Negro's misdeeds, if any, since blacks could neither sue nor be sued.) The Quaker [[Zephaniah Kingsley]], who believed that the amalgamation of the \"races\" was desirable, was forced to leave the country for Haiti. In the South, free Blacks, who could and did learn to read and write, were often in touch with abolitionist writings. The slave owners who controlled those states saw the free Blacks as a threat to the stability of their economy and society, and made no secret of their desire to get rid of them.\n\n==The new freed slave \"problem\"==\nMuch of the African-American population was freed people seeking opportunity. Many Southern freed blacks migrated to the industrial North to seek employment, while others moved to surrounding Southern states.<ref>David Jenkins, ''Black Zion: The Return of Afro-Americans and West Indians to Africa'' (London: Wildwood House, 1975), pp. 41\u20133.</ref> Their progress was met with hostility, as many whites were not used to sharing space with blacks in a context outside of chattel slavery. Many did not believe that free Africans had a place in America.<ref>Kenneth C. Barnes, ''Journey of Hope: The Back-to-Africa Movement in Arkan'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 3.</ref>\n\nIn the North, many whites believed that blacks could not achieve equality in the United States and therefore pushed for their emigration to Africa,<ref>Dixon, Rebecca S. \"Back to Africa Movement.\" Freedom Facts and Firsts: 400 Years of the African American Civil Rights Experience, Jessica Carney Smith, and Linda T.

One proponent of the colonization movement, Solomon Parker of [[Hampshire County, Virginia]], was quoted as having said: \u201cI am not willing that the Man or any of my Blacks shall ever be freed to remain in the United States....

The back-to-Africa movement was seen as the solution to these problems by both groups, with more support from the white population than the black population. Blacks often viewed the project with skepticism, particularly among the middle-class, who feared that the Colonization movement was a ploy to deport freed African Americans to restrict their efforts against slavery. Shortly after the foundation of the [[American Colonization Society]], 3,000 free blacks gathered in a church in [[Philadelphia]] and issued forth a declaration stating that they \"will never separate ourselves voluntarily from the slave population of the country.\"<ref name=Irvine>{{cite journal\n|title=The Noyes Academy, 1834\u201335: The Road to the Oberlin Collegiate Institute and the Higher Education of African-Americans in the Nineteenth Century\n|last1=Irvine\n|first1=Russell W.\n|last2=Dunkerton\n|first2=Donna Zani\n|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies\n|date=Winter 1998\n|volume=22\n|issue=4\n|pages=260\u2013273\n|via=Ebscohost\n|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=123c7d3d-4352-4a8c-b4d6-c8d9a9246ff2%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}</ref>{{rp|261}} Similarly, black leaders, such as James Forten, who had previously supported the Colonization Movement, changed their minds as a result of widespread black resistance to the idea.<ref name=\":1\">White, Deborah Gray. \"Slavery and Freedom in the New Republic.\" In <nowiki>''Freedom on my mind''</nowiki>.

At the same time, many religious people in America struggled to reconcile slavery with their beliefs.\n\nWhen the enslaved population of America was mostly [[Muslim]] or practiced indigenous African religions, slavery was substantiated on Christian evangelical grounds. In the 19th century, many religious Americans found it difficult to continue supporting the enslavement of their brothers in Christ, especially amongst the [[Quakers]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Two examples of such Christians are Reverend Moses Tichnell and Reverend Samuel R. Houston, who freed slaves and sent them to Liberia in 1855 and 1856 respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> These two men, believing that they were morally obligated to finance such voyages, played an important role in the colonization movement.\n\n===American Colonization Society===\n{{main|American Colonization Society}}\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was an early advocate of the idea of resettling American-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816 by [[Charles Fenton Mercer]], it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from America.<ref>[http://personal.denison.edu/~waite/liberia/history/acs.htm The American Colonization Society.]</ref>\n\nSince its inception, the American Colonization Society struggled to garner support from within free black communities. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, the creation of an independent [[Liberia]]n state splintered the nearly uniform voice against colonization. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] provided the United States government ample power to recapture fugitive slaves. Following its passage, many black leaders promoted emigration and colonization to a nation that would provide and protect their rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Brandon|title=The United States of Africa|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|date=2014|volume=34|issue=1|page=98|doi=10.1353/jer.2014.0012}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this, several black critics were outspoken against the Back-to-Africa movement and the activities of the American Colonization Society. A report from a free black political conference in New York warned: \"all kinds of chicanery and stratagem will be employed to allure the people [to the colony]...the independence of its inhabitants; the enjoyment and privileges of its citizens, will be pictured forth in glowing colors, to deceive you.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Brandon|title=The United States of Africa|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|date=Spring 2014|volume=34|issue=1|page=101|doi=10.1353/jer.2014.0012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclopedia of Georgia History and Culture'', \"as early as 1820, black Americans had begun to return to their ancestral homeland through the auspices of the American Colonization Society.\" By 1847, the American Colonization Society founded [[Liberia]], a land to be settled by black people returning from the United States of America.<ref>[http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=4 \"Back-to-Africa Movement\"], ''The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture''. 2007.

According to Crumrin, however, the most important reason for the decline in the back-to-Africa movement was that the \"vast majority of those who were meant to colonize did not wish to leave. Most free blacks simply did not want to go \"home\" to a place from which they were generations removed.

This continued, and in early 1939 Bilbo began drafting what came to be known as the Greater Liberia Bill. The bill suggested that the United States purchase four hundred thousand square miles of African land off England and France, crediting them as war debts, and provide financial assistance for black Americans to relocate to Africa.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOutside of the black nationalism movement, the bill did not garner much support, with leading civil rights groups such as the [[NAACP]] refusing to endorse it and the national press lambasting it.

Some 7,000 enslaved people were freed by their masters, so at that point those free African Americans left the U.S. to escape racism and have more opportunities (mainly because they had lost all hope of achievement). In the 1830s, the movement became increasingly dominated by Southern slave owners, who did not want free blacks and saw sending them to Liberia as a solution. Slaves freed from slave ships were sent here instead of their countries of origin. The emigration of free blacks to Liberia particularly increased after the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner rebellion]] of 1831. Middle-class blacks were more resolved to live as black Americans, many rural poor folks gave up on the United States and looked to Liberia to construct a better life. Liberia promised freedom and equality; it also represented a chance for a better life for the South's black farmers. The Liberian government offered 25 acres of free land for each immigrant family, and 10 acres for a single adult, who came to the Black republic. In the early 19th century, Liberia evoked mixed images in the minds of black Americans. They viewed Liberia as a destination for black families who left the United States in search of a better way of life, returning to their ancestral homeland of Africa.<ref name=barnes />{{rp|2\u20139}}\n\nAs noted by researcher Washington Hyde, \"Black Americans\u2014who in the time of slavery lost their original languages and much of their original culture, gained a distinctly American, English-speaking Christian identity, and had no clear idea of precisely where in the wide continent of Africa their ancestors had come from\u2014were perceived by the natives of Liberia as foreign settlers. Having an African ancestry and a black skin color were definitely not enough. Indeed, their settlement in Liberia had much in common with the contemporary white settlement of the [[American Frontier]] and these settlers' struggle with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.... The Liberian experience can also be considered as anticipating that of [[Zionism]] and [[Israel]] \u2013 with Jews similarly seeking redemption through a return to an ancestral land and similarly being regarded as foreign interlopers by the local Arab tribes. It would take [[Americo-Liberian]]s a century and more to become truly accepted as one of Liberia's ethnic groups.... All of which certainly contributed to most Black Americans rejecting the Back-to-Africa option and opting instead for seeking equal rights in America.\"<ref>Dr. Washington Hyde, ''The Tortuous Route of Black American History'', Ch. 3, 5.</ref>\n\n==Ex-slave repatriation==\n'''Ex-slave repatriation''' or the emigration of [[African-American]], [[Caribbean]], and [[Black British]] slaves to [[Africa]] occurred mainly during the late 18th century to mid-19th century. In the cases of [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], both were established by former slaves who were repatriated to Africa within a 28-year period.\n\n===Sierra Leone===\nMany freed slaves were discontent with where they were resettled in Canada after the American Revolution and were eager to return to their homeland. Beginning in 1787, the British government made their first attempt to settle people in Sierra Leone. 300 former slaves were settled on the Sierra Leone peninsula in West Africa. Two years later, most members of the settlement would die from disease or conflict with the local [[Temne people]]. In 1792, a second attempt at settlement was made when 1,100 freed slaves established Freetown with support from British abolitionist [[Thomas Clarkson]].\n\nIn 1815, [[Paul Cuffe]] brought the first group of thirty-eight emigrant freed slaves from the United States to Sierra Leone. In 1820, minister Daniel Coker led a group of ninety free blacks in hopes of founding a new colony in Sierra Leone. He intended to proselytize Christianity among the Africans. Leaving New York on the ship ''Elizabeth'', his voyage ended on an island off the coast of Sierra Leone. Arriving just before the rains of spring, the group of immigrants were soon stricken with fever. The survivors ultimately fled to Freetown, and the settlement disintegrated.\n\nThe American Colonization Society came under attack from American abolitionists, who insisted that the removal of freed slaves from the United States reinforced the institution of slavery.\n\nThe repatriation of slaves to Africa from the [[United Kingdom]] and its dependencies was initiated by the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor]]. This organization was later succeeded by the [[Sierra Leone Company]]. In time, African American [[Black Loyalists]] and [[West Indians]] would immigrate to the colony of [[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]], Sierra Leone, in smaller numbers in efforts led by black merchants or beneficiaries such as Paul Cuffe.\n\nIn 2006, African-American actor [[Isaiah Washington]] was adopted into a Mende family and bestowed with the title [[Chieftain|chief]] GondoBay Manga. In 2010, he received Sierra Leonean citizenship after a genealogical DNA test revealed his ancestral descent from the Mendes.

In general the movement was an overwhelming failure; very few freed slaves wanted to move to Africa, and the small number that did\u2014some under duress\u2014initially faced brutal conditions. As the failure became known in the United States in the 1820s, it spawned and energized the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]]. Liberia and Sierra Leone became independent black countries after Ha\u00efti (January 1st 1804), and became the second and the third of the only three countries founded by former slaves. U.S. Ambassador to Liberia was a coveted position. In the twentieth century [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]], and some other African Americans espoused the concept, but few actually left the United States.\n\n==Background==\nThe question of where free blacks of American birth should reside was not much discussed by white writers in the eighteenth century: \"At the time of the [[American Revolution]], there had been few free blacks anywhere in the country.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Gateway to Freedom.

There was a small number of free blacks who worked and lived in various of the colonies.\n\nPressures for ending slavery began small but grew steadily. Various philosophical and religious condemnations of it, especially by [[Quakers]], were published. Slavery became illegal in the United Kingdom in 1772 by court decision (see [[Somerset v Stewart]]), and in the British colonies by statute in 1838. In France slavery was illegal at least since the sixteenth century, and as part of the [[French Revolution]], it was abolished in French colonies in 1794 (although it was restored from 1802 to 1848). Starting in 1791 the slaves of [[Saint-Domingue]] revolted, gaining their freedom, and established the free Black country of [[History of Haiti|Haiti]]. Starting with Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in 1780, slavery was gradually abolished in all the Northern states, although this did not mean that existing slaves were always freed. (Vermont, which at the time was not part of the United States, abolished slavery in 1777.) By the [[1850 census]] there are no slaves in the [[Slave states and free states|free states]]; there were still hundreds in the [[1840 census]] (and millions in the South). In the South, sometimes influenced by appeals from preachers \u2014 [[abolitionism in the United States]] had a strong religious component \u2014 some individuals freed their slaves, or left in their wills instructions to free them upon their owner's death.\n\nThe number of free Blacks in the new United States skyrocketed, and the question of \"what to do with them\" steadily grew in importance. Even when free, most were not citizens with no legal rights, as the [[Dred Scott]] decision made clear. Usually seen as \"racially\" inferior, few believed them a desirable or even a possible part of American society. They were prohibited from living in some areas, and there was legal discrimination that is astonishing today. (Black passengers on river boats were not allowed in the cabin, but had to stay on deck, whatever the weather. In Florida, each free black man had to have a white man who could be sued for the Negro's misdeeds, if any, since blacks could neither sue nor be sued.) The Quaker [[Zephaniah Kingsley]], who believed that the amalgamation of the \"races\" was desirable, was forced to leave the country for Haiti. In the South, free Blacks, who could and did learn to read and write, were often in touch with abolitionist writings. The slave owners who controlled those states saw the free Blacks as a threat to the stability of their economy and society, and made no secret of their desire to get rid of them.\n\n==The new freed slave \"problem\"==\nMuch of the African-American population was freed people seeking opportunity. Many Southern freed blacks migrated to the industrial North to seek employment, while others moved to surrounding Southern states.<ref>David Jenkins, ''Black Zion: The Return of Afro-Americans and West Indians to Africa'' (London: Wildwood House, 1975), pp. 41\u20133.</ref> Their progress was met with hostility, as many whites were not used to sharing space with blacks in a context outside of chattel slavery. Many did not believe that free Africans had a place in America.<ref>Kenneth C. Barnes, ''Journey of Hope: The Back-to-Africa Movement in Arkan'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 3.</ref>\n\nIn the North, many whites believed that blacks could not achieve equality in the United States and therefore pushed for their emigration to Africa,<ref>Dixon, Rebecca S. \"Back to Africa Movement.\" Freedom Facts and Firsts: 400 Years of the African American Civil Rights Experience, Jessica Carney Smith, and Linda T.

One proponent of the colonization movement, Solomon Parker of [[Hampshire County, Virginia]], was quoted as having said: \u201cI am not willing that the Man or any of my Blacks shall ever be freed to remain in the United States....

The back-to-Africa movement was seen as the solution to these problems by both groups, with more support from the white population than the black population. Blacks often viewed the project with skepticism, particularly among the middle-class, who feared that the Colonization movement was a ploy to deport freed African Americans to restrict their efforts against slavery. Shortly after the foundation of the [[American Colonization Society]], 3,000 free blacks gathered in a church in [[Philadelphia]] and issued forth a declaration stating that they \"will never separate ourselves voluntarily from the slave population of the country.\"<ref name=Irvine>{{cite journal\n|title=The Noyes Academy, 1834\u201335: The Road to the Oberlin Collegiate Institute and the Higher Education of African-Americans in the Nineteenth Century\n|last1=Irvine\n|first1=Russell W.\n|last2=Dunkerton\n|first2=Donna Zani\n|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies\n|date=Winter 1998\n|volume=22\n|issue=4\n|pages=260\u2013273\n|via=Ebscohost\n|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=123c7d3d-4352-4a8c-b4d6-c8d9a9246ff2%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}</ref>{{rp|261}} Similarly, black leaders, such as James Forten, who had previously supported the Colonization Movement, changed their minds as a result of widespread black resistance to the idea.<ref name=\":1\">White, Deborah Gray. \"Slavery and Freedom in the New Republic.\" In <nowiki>''Freedom on my mind''</nowiki>.

At the same time, many religious people in America struggled to reconcile slavery with their beliefs.\n\nWhen the enslaved population of America was mostly [[Muslim]] or practiced indigenous African religions, slavery was substantiated on Christian evangelical grounds. In the 19th century, many religious Americans found it difficult to continue supporting the enslavement of their brothers in Christ, especially amongst the [[Quakers]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Two examples of such Christians are Reverend Moses Tichnell and Reverend Samuel R. Houston, who freed slaves and sent them to Liberia in 1855 and 1856 respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> These two men, believing that they were morally obligated to finance such voyages, played an important role in the colonization movement.\n\n===American Colonization Society===\n{{main|American Colonization Society}}\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was an early advocate of the idea of resettling American-born blacks in Africa. Founded in 1816 by [[Charles Fenton Mercer]], it was composed of two core groups: abolitionists and slave owners. Abolitionist members believed in freeing African slaves, along with their descendants, and providing them with the opportunity to return to Africa. Slave owning members believed free blacks endangered the system of slavery and sought to expel them from America.<ref>[http://personal.denison.edu/~waite/liberia/history/acs.htm The American Colonization Society.]</ref>\n\nSince its inception, the American Colonization Society struggled to garner support from within free black communities. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, the creation of an independent [[Liberia]]n state splintered the nearly uniform voice against colonization. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] provided the United States government ample power to recapture fugitive slaves. Following its passage, many black leaders promoted emigration and colonization to a nation that would provide and protect their rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=Brandon|title=The United States of Africa|journal=Journal of the Early Republic|date=2014|volume=34|issue=1|page=98|doi=10.1353/jer.2014.0012}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of this, several black critics were outspoken against the Back-to-Africa movement and the activities of the American Colonization Society.

Cox provided influential connections that the movement had previously lacked, and he gave the issue of black emigration political exposure when he managed to convince members of the Virginia General Assembly to recommend the US Congress provide financial aid for this in 1936.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Set the world on fire : black nationalist women and the global struggle for freedom|last=Blain, Keisha N., 1985\u2013|isbn=978-0-8122-9477-4|location=Philadelphia|oclc=1021885414|date = 2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\nHis support soon began to diminish and so Gordon looked elsewhere, once again finding an unlikely ally on the opposite side of the moral compass in Senator [[Theodore G. Bilbo]]. An ardent white supremacist, Bilbo had been campaigning within government for racial separatism for a while. He proposed an amendment to the House Joint Resolution 679 \u2013 a work relief bill \u2013 in 1938, that would have \"repatriated\" African-American volunteers to Liberia, providing them with financial assistance. This amendment was endorsed by [[Marcus Garvey]] and the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|UNIA]] at the Eight International UNIA convention.<ref name=\":2\" /> This provided the precedent for the movement to progress; Bilbo had the political capital to get the issue of black repatriation into wide-scale political debate. This continued, and in early 1939 Bilbo began drafting what came to be known as the Greater Liberia Bill. The bill suggested that the United States purchase four hundred thousand square miles of African land off England and France, crediting them as war debts, and provide financial assistance for black Americans to relocate to Africa.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOutside of the black nationalism movement, the bill did not garner much support, with leading civil rights groups such as the [[NAACP]] refusing to endorse it and the national press lambasting it. The bill was also not met with any real support in the Senate, and thus the idea of black repatriation lost much of is traction, with the outbreak of the Second World War also making any passing of the bill unlikely.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Liberia==\n{{main|History of Liberia}}\n[[File:(1896) Departure of colored emigrants for Liberia - The Illustrated American, March 21, 1896.jpg|thumb|African Americans depart for Liberia, 1896]]\nThe [[history of Liberia]] (after European arrival) is, with [[Sierra Leone]], unique in [[Africa]]; starting neither as a native state, nor as a European colony.

Their plan was to follow the paths that the British had taken, or simply take a chance on where they would land. At first, they followed the previous routes of the British and reached the coast of Sierra Leone. After leaving Sierra Leone, the Americans slowly reached a more southern part of the African coastline.\n\nThe Americans were eventually successful at finding a suitable spot to establish their colonies, arriving at what the British had named the Grain Coast. (The name of this region referred to the type of ginger spice used for medicine flavoring, ''aframomum meleguete''.) Along the Grain Coast, local African chiefs willingly gave the Americans tracts of land.{{dubious|date=August 2019}} Over the course of twenty years, a series of fragmented settlements sprung across Liberia's lightly settled shore. Along with the difficulty of gaining enough land, life proved hard for these early settlers. Disease was widespread, along with the lack of food. Hostile tribes presented the settlers with great struggle, destroying some of their new land settlements. Almost 50% of the new settlers died in the first twenty years after their arrival in Liberia.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Tim|title=Our Man In Liberia|journal=History Today|year=2010|volume=60|issue=10|pages=10\u201317}}</ref>\n\nLiberia declared independence on 26 July 1847.<ref name=barnes>Kenneth C.

Some 7,000 enslaved people were freed by their masters, so at that point those free African Americans left the U.S. to escape racism and have more opportunities (mainly because they had lost all hope of achievement). In the 1830s, the movement became increasingly dominated by Southern slave owners, who did not want free blacks and saw sending them to Liberia as a solution. Slaves freed from slave ships were sent here instead of their countries of origin. The emigration of free blacks to Liberia particularly increased after the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner rebellion]] of 1831. Middle-class blacks were more resolved to live as black Americans, many rural poor folks gave up on the United States and looked to Liberia to construct a better life. Liberia promised freedom and equality; it also represented a chance for a better life for the South's black farmers. The Liberian government offered 25 acres of free land for each immigrant family, and 10 acres for a single adult, who came to the Black republic. In the early 19th century, Liberia evoked mixed images in the minds of black Americans. They viewed Liberia as a destination for black families who left the United States in search of a better way of life, returning to their ancestral homeland of Africa.<ref name=barnes />{{rp|2\u20139}}\n\nAs noted by researcher Washington Hyde, \"Black Americans\u2014who in the time of slavery lost their original languages and much of their original culture, gained a distinctly American, English-speaking Christian identity, and had no clear idea of precisely where in the wide continent of Africa their ancestors had come from\u2014were perceived by the natives of Liberia as foreign settlers. Having an African ancestry and a black skin color were definitely not enough. Indeed, their settlement in Liberia had much in common with the contemporary white settlement of the [[American Frontier]] and these settlers' struggle with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.... The Liberian experience can also be considered as anticipating that of [[Zionism]] and [[Israel]] \u2013 with Jews similarly seeking redemption through a return to an ancestral land and similarly being regarded as foreign interlopers by the local Arab tribes. It would take [[Americo-Liberian]]s a century and more to become truly accepted as one of Liberia's ethnic groups.... All of which certainly contributed to most Black Americans rejecting the Back-to-Africa option and opting instead for seeking equal rights in America.\"<ref>Dr. Washington Hyde, ''The Tortuous Route of Black American History'', Ch. 3, 5.</ref>\n\n==Ex-slave repatriation==\n'''Ex-slave repatriation''' or the emigration of [[African-American]], [[Caribbean]], and [[Black British]] slaves to [[Africa]] occurred mainly during the late 18th century to mid-19th century. In the cases of [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], both were established by former slaves who were repatriated to Africa within a 28-year period.\n\n===Sierra Leone===\nMany freed slaves were discontent with where they were resettled in Canada after the American Revolution and were eager to return to their homeland. Beginning in 1787, the British government made their first attempt to settle people in Sierra Leone. 300 former slaves were settled on the Sierra Leone peninsula in West Africa. Two years later, most members of the settlement would die from disease or conflict with the local [[Temne people]]. In 1792, a second attempt at settlement was made when 1,100 freed slaves established Freetown with support from British abolitionist [[Thomas Clarkson]].\n\nIn 1815, [[Paul Cuffe]] brought the first group of thirty-eight emigrant freed slaves from the United States to Sierra Leone. In 1820, minister Daniel Coker led a group of ninety free blacks in hopes of founding a new colony in Sierra Leone. He intended to proselytize Christianity among the Africans. Leaving New York on the ship ''Elizabeth'', his voyage ended on an island off the coast of Sierra Leone. Arriving just before the rains of spring, the group of immigrants were soon stricken with fever. The survivors ultimately fled to Freetown, and the settlement disintegrated.\n\nThe American Colonization Society came under attack from American abolitionists, who insisted that the removal of freed slaves from the United States reinforced the institution of slavery.\n\nThe repatriation of slaves to Africa from the [[United Kingdom]] and its dependencies was initiated by the [[Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor]]. This organization was later succeeded by the [[Sierra Leone Company]]. In time, African American [[Black Loyalists]] and [[West Indians]] would immigrate to the colony of [[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]], Sierra Leone, in smaller numbers in efforts led by black merchants or beneficiaries such as Paul Cuffe.\n\nIn 2006, African-American actor [[Isaiah Washington]] was adopted into a Mende family and bestowed with the title [[Chieftain|chief]] GondoBay Manga. In 2010, he received Sierra Leonean citizenship after a genealogical DNA test revealed his ancestral descent from the Mendes. This was the first instance in which DNA testing was used to gain citizenship to an African nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.switsalone.com/9858_reclaiming-middle-passage-african/|title=Reclaiming the Middle Passage: African-American Actor Isaiah Washington becomes first to use DNA Testing to gain Citizenship to an African Nation (Sierra Leone) \u2013 Sierra Leone News|first=Vickie|last=Remoe|website=www.switsalone.com}}</ref>\n\n==Notable emigrants to Africa==\n*[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]] \u2013 first President of Liberia and founding father\n*[[Thomas Peters (black leader)]] \u2013 African-American Black Loyalist leader and founder of [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]]\n*[[William D.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers no. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nIn the Hoxie Farm site assemblage, 23.5%  of sherds are cordmarked, which is more than on any other Huber Culture site. Fine-line decoration is present on only 13% of decorated sherds.

James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations, felt that Huber was a Component of the Oneota Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and and Huber is the only one that has been found in association with early Historic European trade goods.  Nevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  Hoxie Farm, Griesmer and Moccasin Bluff are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the Oneota tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like Fifield, where Fisher pottery is associated with late Prehistoric artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the Protohistoric or early Historic period.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe artifacts present at Hoxie Farm represent a well-rounded view of life in the Huber culture.  Several items of personal adornment were found here, such as hair accessories, bracelets, and pendants.  Domestic items include knives, scrapers, chisels, needles, and awls.  The bone or antler dice implies games or gambling went on at the site; gambling among Native American tribes has been well-documented.  A bone rasp indicates music was being performed for entertainment or for ceremonial purposes.  The presence of stemmed pipes and several pieces of art with magical or spiritual overtones reflects on the spiritual life of the community.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere is direct evidence of cultivated plants at Hoxie Farm. The remains of [[maize]] were found along with hoes made of bison scapula and elk scapula.  Deer bone was also present in abundance, along with arrowheads for bows-and-arrows, indicating the site residents still relied on hunting; and fish and turtle were also present in the animal bone remains, so they were also exploiting food resources of the nearby marshes and creeks.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nWith regards to seasonality of occupation, based on an analysis of the animal bone remains, the researchers determined the site was occupied from at least spring through fall.  In fact the site may have been occupied year-round since there are storage pits to keep food during the winter.  The presence of non-utilitarian items for music, games and religion also implies an extended residence.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nDespite the fact that the Hoxie Farm site had European trade goods and thus was occupied at a very late date in prehistory, the pottery traits indicate an early placement in the Huber sequence.  The answer may be that the site was occupied longer than the other Huber sites, and therefore the pottery from the entire Huber sequence is present, with early and late types intermixed.  Since the site was not stratified, there was no way for the researchers to segregate artifacts from different time periods.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | editor = James A.

Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarking.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>\n\nOf the 7 whole or reconstructed vessels, 5 are of the type Fifield Bold, one of Huber Trailed, and one that is stylistically different from either Fisher or Huber.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n18 different rim profile types were identified but almost all of them are everted, mostly sharply everted, and 4 types make up the vast majority of vessels.  The most common type is sharply everted with flat lip; the other most common forms are sharply everted with pointed lip, sharply everted and lip thickened to the interior, and sharply everted with flat lip thickened to the exterior.  The most common form of decoration observed on body sherds was medium parallel lines.  This was true for both plain and cordmarked surfaces but the trend was more pronounced with the cordmarked surfaces.  Wide-notched lip decoration was most common; many were medium notched or unnotched but few were fine-notched.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nFollowing Faulkner's typology,<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\n* Huber Plain - 62.5%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 6%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 1.5%, characterized by a smooth surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 23.5%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - about 5% of the assemblage was identified as belonging to the Fisher tradition, another [[Upper Mississippian]] culture which existed in the southern [[Great Lakes]] and was at least partially coterminous with Huber. Fisher pottery is characterized by shell-tempering and predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surfaces, often decorated with curvilinear designs.<ref name=\"Herold\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Griffin\"/>  4% of Fisher sherds/vessels were classified as Fifield Trailed and 1% were Fiflield Bold.\n* Other types - 1%\n\n=== Chronology of Hoxie Farm pottery within the Huber sequence ===\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips.

From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far.

From the establishment of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]] in 1867 until the demise of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1933, the liberal-democratic camp was divided into a \"national-liberal\" and a \"left-liberal\" line of tradition. After 1918 the national-liberal strain was represented by the [[German People's Party]] (DVP), the left-liberal one by the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP, which merged into the [[German State Party]] in 1930). Both parties played an important role in government during the Weimar Republic era, but successively lost votes during the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] since the late-1920s. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]], both liberal parties agreed to the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] and subsequently dissolved themselves. During the 12 years of Hitler's rule, some former liberals collaborated with the Nazis (e.g. economy minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]]), while others resisted actively against Nazism (e.g. the [[Solf Circle]]).\n\nSoon after World War II, the Soviet Union pushed for the creation of licensed \"anti-fascist\" parties in [[Soviet occupation zone|its occupation zone]] in East Germany. In July 1945, former DDP politicians [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]], [[Eugen Schiffer]] and [[Waldemar Koch]] called for the establishment of a pan-German liberal party. Their [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany|Liberal-Democratic Party]] (LDP) was soon licensed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], under the condition that the new party joined the pro-Soviet \"[[Democratic Bloc (East Germany)|Democratic Bloc]]\".\n\nIn September 1945, citizens in [[Hamburg]]\u2014including the anti-Nazi resistance circle \"Association Free Hamburg\"\u2014established the ''Party of Free Democrats'' (PFD) as a [[bourgeois]] left-wing party and the first liberal Party in the Western occupation zones. The German Democratic Party was revived in some states of the Western occupation zones (in the Southwestern states of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] under the name of [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party]]).\n\nMany former members of DDP and DVP however agreed to finally overcome the traditional split of German liberalism into a national-liberal and a left-liberal branch, aiming for the creation of a united liberal party.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Alf Mintzel |title=Besatzungspolitik und Entwicklung der b\u00fcrgerlichen Parteien in den Westzonen (1945\u20131949) |editor=Dietrich Staritz |work=Das Parteiensystem der Bundesrepublik |publisher=Leske + Budrich |year=1976 |page=79}}</ref> In October 1945 a liberal coalition party was founded in the state of [[Bremen]] under the name of Bremen Democratic People's Party. In January 1946, liberal state parties of the [[British occupation zone]] merged into the ''Free Democratic Party of the British Zone'' (FDP). A similar state party in [[Hesse]], called Liberal-Democratic Party, was licensed by the [[Office of Military Government, United States|US military government]] in January 1946. In the state of Bavaria, a ''Free Democratic Party'' was founded in May 1946.\n\nIn the first post-war state elections in 1946, liberal parties performed well in W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden (16.8%), Bremen (18.3%), Hamburg (18.2%) and Greater Berlin (still undivided; 9.3%). The LDP was especially strong in the October 1946 state elections of the Soviet zone\u2014the last free parliamentary election in East Germany\u2014obtaining an average of 24.6% (highest in Saxony-Anhalt, 29.9%, and Thuringia, 28.5%), thwarting an absolute majority of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) that was favoured by the Soviet occupation power. This disappointment to the communists however led to a change of electoral laws in the Soviet zone, cutting the autonomy of non-socialist parties like the LDP and forcing it to join the SED-dominated [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front]], making it a dependent \"[[Bloc party (politics)|bloc party]]\".\n\nThe [[Democratic Party of Germany]] (DPD) was established in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]] on 17 March 1947 as a pan-German party of liberals from all four occupation zones. Its leaders were [[Theodor Heuss]] (representing the DVP of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden in the American zone) and [[Wilhelm K\u00fclz]] (representing the LDP of the Soviet zone). However, the project failed in January 1948 as a result of disputes over K\u00fclz's pro-Soviet direction.\n\n=== Founding of the party ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-098-20a, Heuss.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodor Heuss, first chairman of the FDP and first President of West Germany]]\nThe Free Democratic Party was established on 11\u201312 December 1948 in [[Heppenheim]], in [[Hesse]], as an association of all 13 liberal state parties in the three Western zones of occupation.<ref group=\"Note\">These regionally organised liberal parties were the ''Bremian Democratic People's Party'' (BDV) in the [[Bremen (state)|state of Bremen]], the ''Democratic Party of Southern and Middle Baden'' (DemP) in the [[South Baden|State of South Baden]], the ''Democratic Party'' (DP) in the [[Rhineland-Palatinate|State of Rhineland-Palatinate]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Northern W\u00fcrttemberg-Northern Baden]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]], the [[Democratic People's Party (Germany)|Democratic People's Party of Southern W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] (DVP) in the [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern|State of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]], the united ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) of the British zone of occupation (consisting of five state associations), the ''Free Democratic Party'' (F.D.P.) in the [[Free State of Bavaria]], the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) in the [[State of Hesse]], and the ''Liberal Democratic Party'' (LDP) of [[West Berlin]].

The place for the party's foundation was chosen deliberately: it was at the [[Heppenheim Assembly]] that the moderate liberals had met in October 1847 before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]]. Some regard the \"Heppenheim Assembly\", which was held at the Hotel ''Halber Mond'' on 10 October 1847, as a meeting of leading liberals that was the beginning of the German Revolution of 1848-49.\n\nThe FDP was founded on 11 December 1948 through the merger of nine regional liberal parties formed in 1945 from the remnants of the pre-1933 [[German People's Party]] (DVP) and the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP), which had been active in the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== 1949\u20131969: reconstruction of Germany ===\n[[File:Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter - FDP election campaign poster, Germany 1949.jpg|thumb|\"Schlu\u00dfstrich drunter!\"\u2014FDP election campaign poster before the 1949 Bundestag election in Hesse calling for a halt on [[denazification]]]]\nIn the [[1949 West German federal election|first elections to the Bundestag on 14 August 1949]], the FDP won a vote share of 11.9 percent (with 12 direct mandates, particularly in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse), and thus obtained 52 of 402 seats. In September of the same year the FDP chairman [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected the first [[President of Germany|President]] of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In his [[1954 West German presidential election|1954 re-election]], he received the best election result to date of a President with 871 of 1018 votes (85.6 percent) of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Assembly]]. Adenauer was also elected on the proposal of the new German President with an extremely narrow majority as the first Chancellor. The FDP participated with the CDU/CSU and the [[German Party (1947)|DP]] in Adenauer's coalition cabinet: they had three ministers: [[Franz Bl\u00fccher]] (Vice-Chancellor), [[Thomas Dehler]] (Justice) and [[Eberhard Wildermuth]] (housing).\n\nOn the most important economic, social and [[German question|German national]] issues, the FDP agreed with their coalition partners, the CDU/CSU. However, the FDP recommended to the bourgeois voters a secular party that refused the [[Parochial school|religious schools]] and  accused the opposition parties of clericalization. The FDP said they were known also as a consistent representative of the market economy, while the CDU was then dominated nominally from the [[Ahlen Programme]], which allowed a [[Third Way]] between [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]]. [[Ludwig Erhard]], the \"father\" of the [[social market economy]], had his followers in the early years of the Federal Republic in the Union rather than in the FDP.\n\nThe FDP won Hesse's 1950 state election with 31.8 percent, the best result in its history, through appealing to East Germans displaced by the war by including them on their ticket.\n\nUp to the 1950s, several of the FDP's regional organizations were to the right of the CDU/CSU, which initially had ideas of some sort of Christian socialism, and even former office-holders of the Third Reich were courted with national, patriotic values. The FDP voted in parliament at the end of 1950 against the CDU- and SPD- introduced [[de-nazification]] process. At their party conference in Munich in 1951 they demanded the release of all \"so-called [[war crime|war criminals]]\" and welcomed the establishment of the \"Association of German soldiers\" of former [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, to advance the integration of the nationalist forces in democracy. The 1953 Naumann-Affair, named after [[Werner Naumann]], identifies old Nazis trying to infiltrate the party, which had many right-wing and nationalist members in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Lower Saxony]]. After the [[British occupation zone|British occupation authorities]] had arrested seven prominent members of the [[Naumann circle]], the FDP federal board installed a commission of inquiry, chaired by Thomas Dehler, which particularly sharply criticized the situation in the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP. In the following years, the right wing lost power, and the extreme right increasingly sought areas of activity outside the FDP. In the [[1953 West German federal election|1953 federal election]], the FDP received 9.5 percent of the party votes, 10.8 percent of the primary vote (with 14 direct mandates, particularly in [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], Hesse, [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]) and 48 of 487 seats.\n\nIn the second term of the Bundestag, the South German Liberal democrats gained influence in the party.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Thomas Dehler, a representative of a more left-liberal course took over as party and parliamentary leader. The former Minister of Justice Dehler, who in 1933 suffered persecution by the Nazis, was known for his rhetorical focus. Generally the various regional associations were independent and translated so different from country to country accents in liberal politics. After the FDP had left in early 1956, the coalition with the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia and made with SPD and center a new state government, were a total of 16 members of parliament, including the four federal ministers from the FDP and founded the short-lived Free People's Party, which then up was involved to the end of the legislature instead of FDP in the Federal Government. The FDP first took it to the opposition.\n\nOnly one of the smaller post-war parties, the FDP survived despite many problems. In [[1957 West German federal election|1957 federal elections]] they still reached 7.7 percent of the vote to 1990 and their last direct mandate with which they had held 41 of 497 seats in the Bundestag. However, they still remained in opposition, because the Union won an absolute majority. In the following example, the FDP sat for a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe.\n\nEven before the election Dehler was assigned as party chairman. At the federal party in Berlin at the end January 1957 relieved him Reinhold Maier. Dehler's role as Group Chairman took over after the election of the national set very Erich Mende. Mende was also chairman of the party.\n\nIn the [[1961 West German federal election|1961 federal elections]], it achieved 12.8 percent nationwide, the best result until then, and the FDP entered a coalition with the CDU again. Although it was committed before the election to continuing to sit in any case in a government together with Adenauer, Chancellor Adenauer was again, however, to withdraw under the proviso, after two years. These events led to the FDP being nicknamed the ''Umfallerpartei'' (\"pushover party\").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OThqlaLQjFIC&pg=PA65 |page=66 |title=Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Eine Bilanz nach 60 Jahren |isbn=9783412202378 |last1=Schwarz |first1=Hans-Peter |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Spiegel Affair]], the FDP withdrew their ministers from the federal government. Although the coalition was renewed again under Adenauer in 1962, the FDP withdrew again on the condition in October 1963. This occurred even under the new Chancellor, Ludwig Erhard. This was for Erich Mende turn the occasion to go into the cabinet: he took the rather unimportant Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs.\n\nIn the [[1965 West German federal election|1965 federal elections]] the FDP gained 9.5 percent. The coalition with the CDU in 1966 broke on the subject of tax increases and it was followed by a grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD. The opposition also pioneered a course change to: The former foreign policy and the attitude to the eastern territories were discussed. The new chairman elected delegates in 1968 Walter Scheel, a European-oriented liberals, although it came from the national liberal camp, but with Willi Weyer and Hans-Dietrich Genscher led the new center of the party. This center strove to make the FDP coalition support both major parties. Here, the Liberals approached to by their reorientation in East Germany and politics especially of the SPD.\n\n=== 1969\u20131982: social changes and crises ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-047-20, Walter Scheel.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Scheel]] served as Foreign Minister, Vice Chancellor, Acting Chancellor and [[President of Germany]]]]\nOn 21 October 1969 began the period after the election of a Social-Liberal coalition with the SPD and the German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]. Walter Scheel was he who initiated the foreign policy reversal. Despite a very small majority he and Willy Brandt sat by the controversial New Ostpolitik. This policy was within the FDP quite controversial, especially since after the entry into the Federal Government defeats in state elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Saarland on 14 June 1970 followed. In Hanover and Saarbr\u00fccken, the party left the parliament.\n\nAfter the federal party congress in Bonn, just a week later supported the policy of the party leadership and Scheel had confirmed in office, founded by Siegfried party rights Zoglmann 11 July 1970 a \"non-partisan\" organization called the National-Liberal action on the Hohensyburgstra\u00dfe - to fall with the goal of ending the left-liberal course of the party and Scheel. However, this was not. Zoglmann supported in October 1970 a disapproval resolution of opposition to Treasury Secretary Alexander M\u00f6ller, Erich Mende, Heinz Starke, and did the same. A little later all three declared their withdrawal from the FDP; Mende and Strong joined the CDU, Zoglmann later founded the German Union ''(Deutsche Union)'', which remained a splinter party.\n\nThe foreign policy and the socio-political changes were made in 1971 by the Freiburg theses, which were as Rowohlt Paperback sold more than 100,000 times, on a theoretical basis, the FDP is committed to \"social liberalism\" and social reforms. Walter Scheel was first foreign minister and vice chancellor, 1974, he was then second-liberal President and paving the way for inner-party the previous interior minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher free.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974 the FDP supported the SPD Chancellor Willy Brandt, who was succeeded by [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Already by the end of the 70s there did not seem to be enough similarities between the FDP and the SPD to form a new coalition, but the CDU/CSU chancellor candidate of Franz Josef Strauss in 1980 pushed the parties to run together again. The FDP's policies, however, began to drift apart from the SPD's, especially when it came to the economy. Within the SPD, there was strong grassroots opposition to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's policies on the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]]. However, within the FDP, the conflicts and contrasts were always greater.\n\n=== 1982\u20131998: Kohl government, economic transition and reunification ===\nIn the fall of 1982, the FDP tore up its coalition agreement with the SPD and instead threw its support behind the CDU/CSU. On 1 October, the FDP and CDU/CSU were able to oust Schmidt and replace him with CDU party chairman Helmut Kohl as the new Chancellor. The coalition change resulted in severe internal conflicts, and the FDP then lost about 20 percent of its 86,500 members, as reflected in the general election in 1983 by a drop from 10.6 percent to 7.0 percent. The members went mostly to the SPD, the Greens and newly formed splinter parties, such as the left-liberal party Liberal Democrats (LD). The exiting members included the former FDP General Secretary and later EU Commissioner G\u00fcnter Verheugen. At the party convention in November 1982, the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] state chairman [[Uwe Ronneburger]] challenged [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] as party chairman. Ronneburger received 186 of the votes\u2014about 40 percent\u2014and was just narrowly defeated by Genscher.\n\nYoung FDP members who did not agree with the politics of the FDP youth organization [[JungdemokratInnen/Junge Linke|Young Democrats]] founded in 1980 the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]] (JuLis). For a time JuLis and the Young Democrats side by side, until the JuLis became the new official youth wing of the FDP. The Young Democrats split from the FDP and were left as a party-independent youth organization.\n\nAt the time of reunification, the FDP's objective was a special economic zone in the former East Germany, but could not prevail against the CDU / CSU, as this would prevent any loss of votes in the five new federal states in the general election in 1990.\n\nIn all federal election campaigns since the 1980s, the party sided with the CDU and CSU, the main conservative parties in Germany.  Following German reunification in 1990, the FDP merged with the [[Association of Free Democrats]], a grouping of liberals from [[East Germany]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]].\n\nDuring the political upheavals of 1989/1990 in the GDR new liberal parties emerged, like the FDP East Germany or the German Forum Party. They formed the Liberal Democratic Party, who had previously acted as a block party on the side of the SED and with Manfred Gerlach also the last Council of State of the GDR presented, the Alliance of Free Democrats, (BFD). Within the FDP came in the following years to considerable internal discussions about dealing with the former block party. Even before the reunification of Germany united on a joint congress in Hanover, the West German FDP united with the other parties to form the first all-German party. Both party factions brought the FDP a great, albeit short-lived, increase in membership. In the first all-German Bundestag elections, the CDU/CSU/FDP center-right coalition was confirmed, the FDP received 11.0 percent of the valid votes (79 seats) and won (in Halle (Saale)) the first direct mandate since 1957.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the FDP won between 6.2 and 11 percent of the vote in Bundestag elections. It last participated in the federal government by representing the junior partner in the government of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] of the CDU.\n\nIn 1998, the CDU/CSU - FDP coalition lost the federal election, which ended the FDP's nearly 30-year reign in government. In its 2002 campaign the FDP made an exception to its party policy of siding with the CDU/CSU when it adopted equidistance to the CDU and SPD. From 1998 until 2009 the FDP remained in the opposition until it became part of a new center-right coalition government.\n\n=== 2005 federal election ===\n[[File:Freie Demokratische Partei, Deutschland (logo - 2005).svg|thumb|100px|Former logo (2001\u20132014)]]\nIn the [[2005 German federal election|2005 general election]] the party won 9.8 percent of the vote and 61 federal deputies, an unpredicted improvement from prior opinion polls. It is believed that this was partly due to [[tactical voting]] by CDU and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] (CSU) alliance supporters who hoped for stronger market-oriented economic reforms than the CDU/CSU alliance called for. However, because the CDU did worse than predicted, the FDP and the CDU/CSU alliance were unable to form a coalition government. At other times, for example after the 2002 federal election, a coalition between the FDP and CDU/CSU was impossible primarily because of the weak results of the FDP.\n\nThe CDU/CSU parties had achieved the third-worst performance in German postwar history with only 35.2 percent of the votes. Therefore, the FDP was unable to form a coalition with its preferred partners, the CDU/CSU parties. As a result, the party was considered as a potential member of two other [[political coalition]]s, following the election. One possibility was a partnership between the FDP, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens]], known as a \"[[traffic light coalition]]\", named after the colors of the three parties. This coalition was ruled out, because the FDP considered the Social Democrats and the Greens insufficiently committed to market-oriented [[economic reform]]. The other possibility was a CDU-FDP-Green coalition, known as a \"[[Jamaica coalition (politics)|Jamaica coalition]]\" because of the colours of the three parties. This coalition wasn't concluded either, since the Greens ruled out participation in any coalition with the CDU/CSU. Instead, the CDU formed a [[Grand coalition]] with the SPD, and the FDP entered the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. FDP leader [[Guido Westerwelle]] became the unofficial leader of the opposition by virtue of the FDP's position as the largest opposition party in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Germany|2009 European Parliament elections]], the FDP received 11% of the national vote (2,888,084 votes in total) and returned 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse//|title=\u00dcbersicht|work=bundeswahlleiter.de|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231614/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/europawahlen/EU_BUND_09/ergebnisse/bundesergebnisse/|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u20132013: Merkel II government ===\n[[File:ChristianLindner-FDP-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christian Lindner]] is the party chairman, having succeeded [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]] in December 2013]]\nIn the [[2009 German federal election|September 2009 federal elections]], the FDP increased its share of the vote by 4.8 percentage points to 14.6%, an all-time record so far.

Medina is celebrated for containing ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi'' and as the city which gave refuge to him and his followers, and so ranks as the second holiest city of Islam, after Mecca.<ref>However, an article in [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200606/Saudi Aramco World] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} by John Anthony states: \"To the perhaps parochial Muslims of North Africa in fact the sanctity of [[Kairouan]] is second only to Mecca among all cities of the world.\" [[Saudi Aramco]]'s bimonthly magazine's goal is to broaden knowledge of the cultures, history and geography of the Arab and Muslim worlds and their connections with the West; pages 30\u201336 of the January/February 1967 print edition [https://web.archive.org/web/20040624130307/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/196701/the.fourth.holy.city.htm The Fourth Holy City]</ref> Muhammad was buried in Medina, under the [[Green Dome]], as were the first two [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], who were buried next to him in what used to be Muhammad's house.\n\nMedina is {{convert|210|mi|abbr=out}} north of Mecca and about {{convert|120|mi|abbr=out}} from the [[Red Sea]] coast. It is situated in the most fertile part of all the Hejazi territory, the streams of the vicinity tending to converge in this locality. An immense [[plain]] extends to the south; in every direction the view is bounded by hills and mountains.\n\nThe historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, {{convert|30|to|40|ft|abbr=out}} high, dating from the 12th century CE, and was flanked with towers, while on a rock, stood a castle. Of its four gates, the ''Bab-al-Salam'', or [[Egypt]]ian gate, was remarkable for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''.\n\nThe graves of [[Fatimah]] ([[Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters|Muhammad's daughter]]) and [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] ([[Ahl al-Bayt|Muhammad's grandson]]), across from the mosque at ''Jannat [[al-Baqi']]'', and Abu Bakr (first caliph and the father of [[Muhammad's wives|Muhammad's wife]], [[Aisha]]), and of Umar ibn Al-Khattab), the second caliph, are also here. The mosque dates back to the time of Muhammad, but has been twice reconstructed.<ref name=\"EA\">1954 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], vol. 18, pp.587, 588</ref>\n\nBecause of the Saudi government's religious policy and concern that historic sites could become the focus for [[idolatry in Islam|idolatry]], much of Medina's Islamic physical heritage has been [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|altered]].\n\n==Religious significance in Islam==\n{{Main|Muhammad in Medina}}\n[[File:The Green Dome, Masjid Nabawi, Madina.jpg|thumb|The Green Dome of the Prophet's Mosque]]\n\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of ''al-Masjid an-Nabawi''. The mosque was expanded by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Caliph [[Al-Walid I]]. [[Mount Uhud]] is a mountain north of Medina which was the site of the second battle between [[Muslim]] and Meccan forces.\n\nAfter Muhammad migrated to Madinah, he built Quba' Mosque and offered prayers in it. He would ride a camel or walk to the mosque every Saturday to offer 2 rakaats of prayers.<ref>{{Citation|last=Moore|first=Cerwyn|chapter=Friday Prayers and Sermon in the Grand Mosque of Mosul|date=2018-01-15|pages=147\u2013152|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-085644-1|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190856441.003.0010|title=Al-Qaeda 2.0}}</ref> Quba' Mosque is now located in the metropolitan area of Medina. It was destroyed by lightning, probably about 850 CE, and the graves were almost forgotten. In 892, the place was cleared up, the graves located and a fine mosque built, which was destroyed by fire in 1257 CE and almost immediately rebuilt. It was restored by [[Qaitbay]], the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Egyptian ruler]], in 1487.<ref name=\"EA\"/> \n\nMuslims are encouraged to perform 2 rakaat of Sunnah prayer at this Quba' Mosque. According to a hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad  said, ''\u201cWhoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\u201d'' (Hadith by Imam Ibn Majah)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muslim.sg/articles/11-places-to-visit-in-madinah?type=articles|title=10 Places To Visit In Madinah|website=muslim.sg|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n''Masjid al-Qiblatain'' is another mosque also historically important to Muslims. It is where the command was sent to Muhammad to change the direction of prayer ([[qibla]]) from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca, according to a [[hadith]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.dawntravels.com/performing-hajj-umrah/ |title=Place Pilgrims Visit During or After Performing Hajj / Umrah |publisher=Dawntravels.com |date= |accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref> At the prayer hall, you would be able to see signs showing the direction of Makkah as well as Jerusalem.

Both cities' numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their '[[Umrah]] (second pilgrimage after Hajj). Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina annually while performing pilgrimage [[Hajj]]. [[Al-Baqi']] is a significant cemetery in Medina where several [[Banu Hashim|family members of Muhammad]], caliphs and scholars are buried.\n\nIslamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times as being sacred in the Quran, for example [[ayah]]; 9:101, 9:129, 59:9, and ayah 63:7. [[Medinan sura]]s are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts.

When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}.

Beyond the walls of the city, west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations. These suburbs also had walls and gates.

When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], he was stopped from doing so by two [[rabbi]]s from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the [[Quraysh]] would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to [[Judaism]]. He took the [[rabbi]]s with him, and in [[Mecca]], they reportedly recognised the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] as a temple built by [[Abraham]] and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.<ref>Guillaume 7\u20139, Peters 49\u201350</ref>\n\nEventually the Banu Aus and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE/1 AH, they had been fighting for 120 years and were the sworn enemies of each other.<ref name=\"balagh.net\">Subhani, ''The Message'': [http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm The Events of the First Year of Migration] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524053521/http://www.balagh.net/english/ahl_bayt/the_message/27.htm |date=24 May 2012 }}</ref> The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aus, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.<ref>For alliances, see Guillaume 253</ref> They fought a total of four wars.<ref name=\"Medina\"/>\n\nTheir last and bloodiest battle was the [[Battle of Bu'ath]]<ref name=\"Medina\"/> that was fought a few years before the arrival of Muhammad.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia 1\"/> The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy]], one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. Until the arrival of Muhammad, he was the most respected inhabitant of Yathrib. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of the city met secretly with [[Muhammad]] in Al-Aqaba, a place between Makkah and Mina, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to Yathrib, where Muhammad could serve as disinterested mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\n\n===Muhammad's arrival===\n{{Main|Hijra (Islam)|Constitution of Medina}}\nIn 622 CE/1 AH, Muhammad and around 70 Meccan [[Muhajirun]] believers left Mecca for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as civic leader. The Muslim converts native to Yathrib of whatever background\u2014pagan Arab or Jewish\u2014were called ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'' (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the [[Zakat]] tax.\n\nAccording to [[Ibn Ishaq]], the local pagan Arab tribes, the Muslim ''[[Muhajirun]]'' from Mecca, the local Muslims (''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]''), and the Jewish population of the area signed an agreement, the [[Constitution of Medina]], which committed all parties to mutual co-operation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by [[Ibn Hisham]] is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement\u2014whether a single document originally or several\u2014is possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.<ref>Firestone 118. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters 116; \"Muhammad\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\"; \"Kurayza, Banu\", \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\".</ref> In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as ''kit\u0101b \u1e0fimmat al-nabi'', written in the 17th year of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]] (638 CE), and which gave express liberty unto Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but were required to pay the [[jizya]] (poll-tax) annually for their protection by their patrons.<ref>Shelomo Dov Goitein, ''The Yemenites \u2013 History, Communal Organization, Spiritual Life'' (Selected Studies), editor: Menahem Ben-Sasson, Jerusalem 1983, pp. 288\u2013299. {{ISBN|965-235-011-7}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Badr====\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Muhammad}}\n{{Main|Battle of Badr}}\n[[File:Battle of Badr.png|thumb|Battle positions at Badr]]\nThe Battle of Badr was a key battle in the early days of Islam and a turning point in Muhammad's struggle with his opponents among the Quraysh in Mecca. In the spring of 624, Muhammad received word from his intelligence sources that a trade caravan, commanded by [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], Chieftain of the Meccan Quraysh, and guarded by thirty to forty men, was travelling from [[Syria (region)|Syria]] back to Mecca. Muhammad gathered an army of 313 men, the largest army the Muslims had put in the field yet. However, many early Muslim sources, including the Quran, indicate that no serious fighting was expected,<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 Sahih al-Bukhari: Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821035058/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/059.sbt.html#005.059.287 |date=21 August 2011 }}</ref> and the future Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] stayed behind to care for his sick wife.\n\nAs the caravan approached Medina, Abu Sufyan began hearing from travellers and riders about Muhammad's planned ambush. He sent a messenger named Damdam to Mecca to warn the Quraysh and get reinforcements. Alarmed, the Quraysh assembled an army of 900\u20131,000 men to rescue the caravan. Many of the Qurayshi nobles, including [[Amr ibn Hish\u0101m]], [[Walid ibn Utba]], Shaiba, and [[Umayyah ibn Khalaf]], joined the army. However, some of the army was to later return to Mecca before the battle.\n\nThe battle started with champions from both armies emerging to engage in combat. The Muslims sent out [[Ali]], [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]] (Obeida), and [[Hamza ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib]]. The Muslims dispatched the Meccan champions in a three-on-three m\u00eal\u00e9e, Hamzah killed his opponent with the very first strike, although Ubaydah was mortally wounded.<ref>[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 Sunan Abu Dawud: Book 14, Number 2659] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820142432/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/abudawud/014.sat.html#014.2659 |date=20 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nNow both armies began firing arrows at each other.

Muhammad marched out to meet the force but before reaching the battle, about one third of the troops under Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew. With a smaller force, the Muslim army had to find a strategy to gain the upper hand. A group of archers were ordered to stay on a hill to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry forces and to provide protection at the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to somewhat retreat. The battle front was pushed further and further away from the archers, whom, from the start of the battle, had really nothing to do but watch. In their growing impatience to be part of the battle, and seeing that they were somewhat gaining advantage over the [[Kafir]]un ([[Infidel]]s) these archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading all along to the rest to not disobey their commanders' orders. But their words were lost among the enthusiastic yodels of their comrades.\n\nHowever, the Meccans' retreat was actually a manufactured manoeuvre that paid off. The hillside position had been a great advantage to the Muslim forces, and they had to be lured off their posts for the Meccans to turn the table over. Seeing that their strategy had actually worked, the Meccans cavalry forces went around the hill and re-appeared behind the pursuing archers. Thus, ambushed in the plain between the hill and the front line, the archers were systematically slaughtered, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill, shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but to little effect.\n\nHowever, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Medinans suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n====Battle of the Trench====\n{{Main|Battle of the Trench}}\n\nIn 627, Abu Sufyan once more led Meccan forces against Medina. Because the people of Medina had dug a trench to further protect the city, this event became known as the Battle of the Trench. After a protracted siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again. During the siege, Abu Sufyan had contacted the remaining Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the defenders from behind the lines. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Banu Aus now interceded on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to the appointment of one of their chiefs, [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]], as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish Law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason (Deutoronomy).<ref name=\"mantran\">Robert Mantran, ''L'expansion musulmane'' Presses Universitaires de France 1995, p. 86.</ref> This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The historian Robert Mantran argues that from this point of view it was successful&nbsp;\u2014 from this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.<ref name=\"mantran\"/>\n\n===Capital city of Muhammad and the Rashidun Caliphate===\n[[File:Madina Munavara.JPG|thumb|250px|Old depiction of Medina during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times]]\n\nIn the ten years following the [[hijra (Islam)|hijra]], Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he [[Conquest of Mecca|marched on Mecca]], entering it without battle in 629 CE/8 AH, all parties acquiescing to his leadership. Afterwards, however, despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca and the ongoing importance of the Meccan [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] for Islamic pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the capital of the early [[caliphate]].\n\n''Yathrib'' was renamed Medina from ''Madinat al-Nabi'' (\"city of the Prophet\" in [[Arabic]]) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and death there. (Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''Medinta'', which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dangoor.com/71page33.html|title=The Jews of Arabia|author=|date=|work=dangoor.com}}</ref>)\n\nUnder the first three caliphs [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], and [[Uthman]], Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the period of Uthman, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE/35 AH and murdered him in his own home. [[Ali]], the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to [[Kufa]] in [[Iraq]]. After that, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power.\n\nIn 1256 CE Medina was threatened by a lava flow from the [[Harrat Rahat]] volcanic area.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0301-07=|title=Harrat Rahat}}</ref><ref>Bosworth,C.

Medina was a city of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]]. Local rule was in the hands of the [[Hashemite]] clan as [[Sharif]]s or [[Emir]]s of Mecca. [[Fakhri Pasha]] was the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] governor of Medina. [[Ali of Hejaz|Ali bin Hussein]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]] and leader of the Hashemite clan, revolted against the [[Caliph]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) and sided with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The city of Medina was besieged by the Sharif's forces, and Fakhri Pasha tenaciously held on during the [[Siege of Medina]] from 1916 till 10 January 1919. He refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the [[Armistice of Moudros]], until he was arrested by his own men.<ref>Peters, Francis (1994).

Though the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is inhabited by an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers of other Arab nationalities (Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.) and Filipinos.\n\n==Geography==\nMedina is located in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz Region]] north-western of the country, {{convert|250|km|abbr=off}} east to the [[Red Sea]] , and {{convert|620|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies at the meeting-point of longitude 39\u00ba36' east and latitude 24\u00ba28' north. It covers an area of about {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}.\n\n===Topography===\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by mountains and volcanic hills, as mentioned in several references and sources. It was known as Yathrib in Writings of ancient Maeniand, this is obvious evidence that the population structure of this desert oasis is a combination of north Arabs and South Arabs, who settled there and built their civilization during the thousand years before Christ.\n\nThe soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly [[basalt]], while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first [[geological period]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era.  It is surrounded by a number of mountains: Al-Hujaj, or Pilgrims' Mountain to the west, Salaa to the north-west, Al-E'er or Caravan Mountain to the south and Uhad to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the junction of the three valleys of Al-Aql, Al-Aqiq, and Al-Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry mountainous region. Its western and southwestern parts have many volcanic rocks. \n\n===Climate===\nMedina has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Summers are extremely hot with daytime temperatures averaging about {{convert|43|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} with nights about {{convert|29|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}.
