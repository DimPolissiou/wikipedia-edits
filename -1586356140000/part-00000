M. Levey''') (25 October 1811 \u2013 28 June 1899) was an Irish violinist, conductor, composer, and teacher. He was one of a handful of noted musicians who kept Dublin's concert life in the nineteenth century alive under difficult economic circumstances.\n\n==Life==\nLevey was born in [[County Meath]], the actual place name is not established. Levey's original surname was O'Shaughnessy, but according to one of his most prominent pupils, the composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], he changed it \"for what he considered to be a more musical one\".{{sfn|Stanford|1914|p=34}} Levey was his mother's maiden name.{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=587}} The name was officially adopted, and all of his children and the following generations were called Levey (according to several sources, Levey had 20 children from three wives).{{sfn|Collins|2004|loc=c.&nbsp;31}}\n\nHe received tuition on the violin in Dublin by James Barton (c.1785\u2013c.1850) and became a member of the orchestra of the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]] in 1826, aged 15, succeeding Barton as concert master there in 1834. From 1834 until the destruction of the edifice by fire in 1880 he was also the musical director of the Theatre Royal, a role that involved conducting the orchestra, composing more than 100 overtures to plays, and directing operatic performances including vocal soloists, a chorus and the orchestra. He was also leader of the orchestras of the Antient Concerts Society and the Philharmonic Society as well as secretary of the Dublin Madrigal Society and the Irish Musical Fund. According to Beausang (2013), \"he was omnipresent for over 50 years at public concerts in Dublin by local and visiting musicians\".{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}} On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his association with the Theatre Royal, he was presented on stage with a \"testimonial\" from the [[Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]] and the [[James Caulfeild, 3rd Earl of Charlemont|Earl of Charlemont]] and a benefit performance.{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}}\n\nStill a young man, Levey played in the orchestra during [[Angelica Catalani]]'s tour of Ireland in 1829 and the visit to Dublin of [[Michael William Balfe]]'s opera company in 1839.{{sfn|Collins|2004|loc=c.&nbsp;31}} Levey also conducted the Irish premiere of Balfe's ''[[The Maid of Artois]]'' In 1840. Balfe, who had also studied with James Barton, remained a life-long friend of Levey's.{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}}\n\nIn addition, Levey was a prominent violin teacher in Dublin. In 1848, he was a co-founder of the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] and was its professor of violin from its foundation until 1897.{{sfn|Collins|2004|loc=c.&nbsp;31}} In 1852, he formed a class for advanced students there modelled on the methods of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]] in Paris and the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Academy of Music in Leipzig]].<ref>''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', 4 May 1852, quoted in {{harvnb|Beausang|2013|p=588}}</ref> His most prominent pupils were [[Robert Prescott Stewart]] and Charles V. Stanford.\n\nLevey was also a keen expert on Irish traditional music. He presented public lectures, played the violin in lectures by others, and published a collection of more than 100 dance tunes in 1858. Following reprints in 1965 and 2003, this is still in use today.\n\nAmong Levey's children was the birth of triplets in April 1837, two of whom became prominent musicians: the violin virtuoso Richard Michael Levey junior (1837\u20131911) who stylised himself as a \"Paganini Redivivus\" (the reborn Paganini) and the operatic composer and conductor [[William Charles Levey]] (1837\u20131894). His great-grandson, [[Michael Levey]] (1927\u20132008), was director the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986, and author of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' (1971).<ref>[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/18/love-that-mozart/ \"Love That Mozart\"], review by [[Charles Rosen]] of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 18 May 1972; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref>\n\nLevey lived to see the opening the new Theatre Royal in December 1897 and died in [[Dalkey]], County Dublin in 1899, aged 87.<ref>According to [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81226486/richard-michael-levey Levey's tombstone]; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref> He is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].\n\n==Assessment==\nAlong with [[John William Glover]], [[Joseph Robinson (composer)|Joseph Robinson]] and his brothers, John Stanford (the father of C. V. Stanford), and [[Robert Prescott Stewart]], Levey was part of a group of committed individuals who kept Dublin musical life going during economically difficult times.\n\nA contemporary source described Levey as \"an accomplished instrumentalist, a skilful composer, a firm but considerate director, an agreeable companion and a respected citizen\".<ref>(anonymous) ''The History of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1870), p.&nbsp;70.</ref> C. V. Stanford characterised him as \"a great character, with a face which might have been the model for the typical Irishman of the comic papers. He was a rough player but an admirable leader of an orchestra\".{{sfn|Stanford|1914|p=34}}\n\nAlthough his incidental music for orchestra does not seem to have survived, Levey's published music for piano, voice and ensembles is characterised by an assured technique and a light and humorous style. Most of Levey's extant compositions are [[quadrille]]s on topical and entertaining subjects of the day. They were published in piano arrangements for home use, but were in most cases publicly performed in band arrangements; some appear to derive from his music to comedies and plays at the Theatre Royal.\n\nTogether with John O'Rorke, Levey authored ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1880), which is an important source on the history of 19th-century Irish music and drama, written mostly in calendarial form.<ref>Paul Rodmell: \"Richard Michael Levey, ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (1880)\", in: Kerry Houston, Maria McHale, Michael Murphy (eds.), ''Documents of Irish Music History in the Long Nineteenth Century'' (= ''Irish Musical Studies'', vol. 12) (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2019), pp.&nbsp;64\u201374.</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nBecause not all dates can be established, works below are listed in alphabetical order (\"n.d.\" = not dated).\n\n===Piano music===\n* ''Ali Baba, or The Forty Thieves Galop'' (London, 1873)\n* ''Arrah-na-Pogue, or The Wicklow Wedding Quadrille'' (London: Metzler & Co., n.d.)\n* ''Beauty and the Beast.

He was also leader of the orchestras of the Antient Concerts Society and the Philharmonic Society as well as secretary of the Dublin Madrigal Society and the Irish Musical Fund. According to Beausang (2013), \"he was omnipresent for over 50 years at public concerts in Dublin by local and visiting musicians\".{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}} On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his association with the Theatre Royal, he was presented on stage with a \"testimonial\" from the [[Gerald FitzGerald, 5th Duke of Leinster|Duke of Leinster]] and the [[James Caulfeild, 3rd Earl of Charlemont|Earl of Charlemont]] and a benefit performance.{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}}\n\nStill a young man, Levey played in the orchestra during [[Angelica Catalani]]'s tour of Ireland in 1829 and the visit to Dublin of [[Michael William Balfe]]'s opera company in 1839.{{sfn|Collins|2004|loc=c.&nbsp;31}} Levey also conducted the Irish premiere of Balfe's ''[[The Maid of Artois]]'' In 1840. Balfe, who had also studied with James Barton, remained a life-long friend of Levey's.{{sfn|Beausang|2013|p=588}}\n\nIn addition, Levey was a prominent violin teacher in Dublin. In 1848, he was a co-founder of the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] and was its professor of violin from its foundation until 1897.{{sfn|Collins|2004|loc=c.&nbsp;31}} In 1852, he formed a class for advanced students there modelled on the methods of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Conservatoire]] in Paris and the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Academy of Music in Leipzig]].<ref>''[[Freeman's Journal]]'', 4 May 1852, quoted in {{harvnb|Beausang|2013|p=588}}</ref> His most prominent pupils were [[Robert Prescott Stewart]] and Charles V. Stanford.\n\nLevey was also a keen expert on Irish traditional music. He presented public lectures, played the violin in lectures by others, and published a collection of more than 100 dance tunes in 1858. Following reprints in 1965 and 2003, this is still in use today.\n\nAmong Levey's children was the birth of triplets in April 1837, two of whom became prominent musicians: the violin virtuoso Richard Michael Levey junior (1837\u20131911) who stylised himself as a \"Paganini Redivivus\" (the reborn Paganini) and the operatic composer and conductor [[William Charles Levey]] (1837\u20131894). His great-grandson, [[Michael Levey]] (1927\u20132008), was director the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986, and author of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' (1971).<ref>[https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1972/05/18/love-that-mozart/ \"Love That Mozart\"], review by [[Charles Rosen]] of ''The Life and Death of Mozart'' in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', 18 May 1972; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref>\n\nLevey lived to see the opening the new Theatre Royal in December 1897 and died in [[Dalkey]], County Dublin in 1899, aged 87.<ref>According to [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/81226486/richard-michael-levey Levey's tombstone]; retrieved 7 April 2020.</ref> He is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].\n\n==Assessment==\nAlong with [[John William Glover]], [[Joseph Robinson (composer)|Joseph Robinson]] and his brothers, John Stanford (the father of C. V. Stanford), and [[Robert Prescott Stewart]], Levey was part of a group of committed individuals who kept Dublin musical life going during economically difficult times.\n\nA contemporary source described Levey as \"an accomplished instrumentalist, a skilful composer, a firm but considerate director, an agreeable companion and a respected citizen\".<ref>(anonymous) ''The History of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1870), p.&nbsp;70.</ref> C. V. Stanford characterised him as \"a great character, with a face which might have been the model for the typical Irishman of the comic papers. He was a rough player but an admirable leader of an orchestra\".{{sfn|Stanford|1914|p=34}}\n\nAlthough his incidental music for orchestra does not seem to have survived, Levey's published music for piano, voice and ensembles is characterised by an assured technique and a light and humorous style. Most of Levey's extant compositions are [[quadrille]]s on topical and entertaining subjects of the day. They were published in piano arrangements for home use, but were in most cases publicly performed in band arrangements; some appear to derive from his music to comedies and plays at the Theatre Royal.\n\nTogether with John O'Rorke, Levey authored ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (Dublin, 1880), which is an important source on the history of 19th-century Irish music and drama, written mostly in calendarial form.<ref>Paul Rodmell: \"Richard Michael Levey, ''Annals of the Theatre Royal, Dublin'' (1880)\", in: Kerry Houston, Maria McHale, Michael Murphy (eds.), ''Documents of Irish Music History in the Long Nineteenth Century'' (= ''Irish Musical Studies'', vol. 12) (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2019), pp.&nbsp;64\u201374.</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nBecause not all dates can be established, works below are listed in alphabetical order (\"n.d.\" = not dated).\n\n===Piano music===\n* ''Ali Baba, or The Forty Thieves Galop'' (London, 1873)\n* ''Arrah-na-Pogue, or The Wicklow Wedding Quadrille'' (London: Metzler & Co., n.d.)\n* ''Beauty and the Beast.

In 1988, he was appointed to the Harriet Ryan Albee Professorship of Microbiology and Immunobiology at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1971, Kieff established an independent research laboratory at the University of Chicago. He focused his research on the newly discovered Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and characterized EBV DNA, RNAs, and virus encoded proteins, including annotation of their roles in infection and oncogenesis. He first purified intact EBV genome DNA, characterized the genome size, base composition, similarities and differences among EBV genomes from people with Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma and Infectious Mononucleosis.  Kieff developed annotated restriction enzyme maps of EBV genomes from humans and non-human primates, and characterized the principal EBV transcripts in latently infected cells.\n\nIn 1986, Kieff moved to Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, where he was appointed to the Harriett Ryan Albee Professorship. He established the utility of second site homologous recombination for genetic analyses that identified the essential EBV genes for growth transformation. His laboratory also identified the roles of EBV Nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and Latent Infection Membrane Proteins (LMPs) in EBV mediated cell growth transformation.  Kieff found LMP1 to be the principal EBV oncogene that uses transcription nuclear factors (TNF) receptor-associated factors to activate NF-\u03baB and promote EBV infected cell growth and survival.<ref name=\"harvard.edu\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, Kieff\u2019s laboratory identified the major signaling components that mediate LMP1 NF-\u03baB activation and characterized the functions of the EBV nuclear antigen proteins.

In 1988, he was appointed to the Harriet Ryan Albee Professorship of Microbiology and Immunobiology at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\n== Research ==\nIn 1971, Kieff established an independent research laboratory at the University of Chicago. He focused his research on the newly discovered Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and characterized EBV DNA, RNAs, and virus encoded proteins, including annotation of their roles in infection and oncogenesis. He first purified intact EBV genome DNA, characterized the genome size, base composition, similarities and differences among EBV genomes from people with Burkitt\u2019s Lymphoma and Infectious Mononucleosis.  Kieff developed annotated restriction enzyme maps of EBV genomes from humans and non-human primates, and characterized the principal EBV transcripts in latently infected cells.\n\nIn 1986, Kieff moved to Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, where he was appointed to the Harriett Ryan Albee Professorship. He established the utility of second site homologous recombination for genetic analyses that identified the essential EBV genes for growth transformation. His laboratory also identified the roles of EBV Nuclear antigens (EBNAs) and Latent Infection Membrane Proteins (LMPs) in EBV mediated cell growth transformation.  Kieff found LMP1 to be the principal EBV oncogene that uses transcription nuclear factors (TNF) receptor-associated factors to activate NF-\u03baB and promote EBV infected cell growth and survival.<ref name=\"harvard.edu\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, Kieff\u2019s laboratory identified the major signaling components that mediate LMP1 NF-\u03baB activation and characterized the functions of the EBV nuclear antigen proteins.
