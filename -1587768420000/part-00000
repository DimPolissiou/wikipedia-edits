The British government acted in expectation of that, especially in the southern campaigns in 1780\u201381. In practice, the number of Loyalists in military service was far lower than expected since Britain could not effectively protect them except in those areas where Britain had military control. The British were often suspicious of them, not knowing whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation; they were often looked down upon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Devoss |first1=David |title=Divided Loyalties |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/divided-loyalties-107489501/ |website=smithsonianmag.com |publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |accessdate=11 July 2019 |language=English |date=January 2004 |quote=Curiously, Tories suffered even at the hands of British officers who, for the most part, dismissed them as ignorant provincials.

Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. [[William Franklin]], the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader [[Benjamin Franklin]], became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778.  He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war, but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected.\n\nWhen their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000\u201370,000 people) fled to other parts of the [[British Empire]], to Britain itself, or to [[British North America]] (now Canada).  The southern Loyalists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, often bringing along their slaves.  Northern Loyalists largely migrated to [[Upper Canada|Ontario]], [[Lower Canada|Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]].  They called themselves [[United Empire Loyalist|United Empire Loyalists]].  Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.

Elsewhere there were few British troops and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina back country, Loyalist recruitment oustripped that of Patriots. A [[Siege of Savage's Old Fields|brief siege]] at [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]] in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting, and a [[Snow Campaign]] involving thousands of partisan militia resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the back country Loyalist leadership. North Carolina back country Scots and former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]].\n\nBy July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments.<ref>Calhoun (1973){{Page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked [[Province of New York|New York]] in August, defeating [[George Washington]]'s army at [[Long Island]] and capturing [[New York City]] and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including [[Philadelphia]] (1777), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1778\u201383), and [[Charleston, South Carolina]] (1780\u201382). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]<ref name = \"Gerogian\">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2709 Georgia Encyclop\u00e6dia].</ref> from 1779 to 1782, despite presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence.\n\n===Numbers of Loyalists===\nHistorian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Historians' best estimates put the proportion of adult white male loyalists somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. Approximately half the colonists of European ancestry tried to avoid involvement in the struggle\u2014some of them deliberate pacifists, others recent immigrants, and many more simple apolitical folk.

Many people\u2014including former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] in [[History of North Carolina|North Carolina]] \u2014 refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders.

Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. About 800 did so; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the [[Battle of Kemp's Landing]] and fought in the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], wearing the motto \"Liberty to Slaves\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], after which they served in the [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783. This forced the rebels to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental Army; however, such promises were often reneged upon by both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117055926/http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 }}</ref>\n\nAmericans who gained their freedom by fighting for the British became known as [[Black Loyalist|Black Loyalists]]. The British honored the pledge of freedom in New York City through the efforts of General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], who recorded the names of African Americans who had supported the British in a document called the [[Book of Negroes]], which granted freedom to slaves who had escaped and assisted the British. About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], where the British promised them land. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], instantly making it the largest [[Free Negro|free black]] community in North America. However, the inferior grants of land they were given and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the [[Shelburne riots|Shelburne Riots]] in 1784, made life very difficult for the community.<ref name=\"blackloyalist.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110054520/http://www.blackloyalist.com/historypage2.html]</ref> In 1791 Britain's [[Sierra Leone Company]] offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality.

However, many of Quebec's inhabitants remained neutral, resisting service to either the British or the Americans.\n\nAlthough some Canadians took up arms in support of the rebellion, the majority remained loyal to the King. [[French Canadians]] had been satisfied by the British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from [[New England]], who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the [[English language|English-speaking]] settlers had arrived following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of Canada]] in 1759\u20131760, and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (including what is now [[New Brunswick]]) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown.\n\nIn late 1775 the [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|sent a force into Quebec]], led by General [[Richard Montgomery]] and Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the Revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the King in the [[Siege of Fort St. Jean]]. In the region south of Montreal that was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the rebellion and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.<ref name = \"Wade\">Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'' (1955) 1:67\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn [[Nova Scotia]], there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the rebellion waned as American Privateers [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution|raided Nova Scotia communities]] throughout the war. As well, the Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the rebel cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax.<ref>George Rawlyck, ''A People Highly Favoured Of God.

The Continental forces would be driven from Quebec in 1776, after the breakup of ice on the St. Lawrence River and the arrival of British transports in May and June. There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the [[War of 1812]].\n\nIn 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York, and surrendered with General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October.  For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities.\n\n===Military service===\n{{Main|Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution}}\n\nThe Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780.<ref>Smith 264\u20137.</ref><ref name=\"Calhoon502\">Calhoon 502.</ref> In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces.<ref>Smith, p 267</ref>  Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].

A precise figure cannot be known because the records were incomplete and not accurate, and small numbers continued to leave after 1783. The 50,000 or-so white departures represented about 10% of the Loyalists (at 20-25% of the white population).<ref>{{cite book|author=Maya Jasanoff|title=Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC&pg=PA357|year=2012|publisher=Random House |page=357|isbn=9781400075478}}</ref> Loyalists (especially soldiers and former officials) could choose evacuation.

The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783.\n\nAfter 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government's offer of free land. Many departed the fledgling U.S. because they faced continuing hostility. In another migration-motivated mainly by economic rather than political reasons-<ref>''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', \"Loyalists\"; and ''Liberty's Exiles'', Maya Jasanoff, pp.&nbsp;206\u2013208.</ref> more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 30,000 \"Late Loyalists\" arrived in Ontario in the 1790s attracted by [[John Graves Simcoe|Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe]]'s policy of land and low taxes, one-fifth those in the US and swearing an oath{{when|date=May 2019}} of allegiance to the King.\n\nThe 36,000 or so who went to Nova Scotia were not well-received by the 17,000 Nova Scotians, who were mostly descendants of New Englanders settled there before the Revolution.<ref>Neil MacKinnon, ''This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia, 1783\u20131791'' (1989)</ref>  \"They [the Loyalists]\", Colonel Thomas Dundas wrote in 1786, \"have experienced every possible injury from the old inhabitants of Nova Scotia, who are even more disaffected towards the British Government than any of the new States ever were.

He was arrested, tried and executed in [[Toronto]], and later became heralded as a patriot to the movement which led to Canadian self governance.\n\nThe wealthiest and most prominent Loyalist exiles went to Great Britain to rebuild their careers; many received pensions. Many Southern Loyalists, taking along their slaves, went to the [[West Indies]], particularly to the [[Abaco Islands]] in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]].\n\nMany Loyalists brought their slaves with them to Canada (mostly to areas that later became [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]) where [[Slavery in Canada|slavery was legal]]. An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property.<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves.\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319</ref>\n\nThousands of [[Iroquois]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada. The descendants of one such group of Iroquois, led by [[Joseph Brant]] (Thayendenegea), settled at [[Six Nations of the Grand River]], the largest [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserve]] in Canada. (The remainder, under the leadership of [[Cornplanter]] (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for [[Sierra Leone]] after facing [[discrimination]] there.\n\nMany of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties was a major issue during the negotiation of the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794. The British Government eventually settled several thousand claims for more than 3.5 million Pounds Sterling,{{citation needed|reason=Lead says 3.0 million; neither cites a reference|date=May 2019}} an enormous sum of money worth at that time.\n\n==Return of some expatriates==\nThe great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including [[Samuel Seabury]], who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and [[Tench Coxe]]. There was a small, but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult.

Moderate Whigs in other States who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country mobilized to block radicals. Most States had rescinded anti-Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783\u201384. South Carolina which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780-82 adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property.  The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.<ref>Rebecca Brannon, ''From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists'' (Univ of South Carolina Press, 2016).</ref> In Connecticut much to the disgust of the Radical Whigs the moderate Whigs were advertising in New York newspapers in 1782-83 that Tories who would make no trouble would be welcome on the grounds that their skills and money would help the State's economy.

A major result was that a Patriot/Whig elite supplanted royal officials and affluent Tories.<ref>The Forging of the New Nation, 1781-1789, Robert B. Morris, 1987, p. 163.</ref>  In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley.  Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families\u2014Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen\u2014destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there.  Massachusetts passed an act banishing forty-six Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston's wealthiest families.  The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different.  One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that \"fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.\"  New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon S.

Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155.

The British government acted in expectation of that, especially in the southern campaigns in 1780\u201381. In practice, the number of Loyalists in military service was far lower than expected since Britain could not effectively protect them except in those areas where Britain had military control. The British were often suspicious of them, not knowing whom they could fully trust in such a conflicted situation; they were often looked down upon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Devoss |first1=David |title=Divided Loyalties |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/divided-loyalties-107489501/ |website=smithsonianmag.com |publisher=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |accessdate=11 July 2019 |language=English |date=January 2004 |quote=Curiously, Tories suffered even at the hands of British officers who, for the most part, dismissed them as ignorant provincials.

Many outspoken or militarily active Loyalists were forced to flee, especially to their stronghold of New York City. [[William Franklin]], the royal governor of New Jersey and son of Patriot leader [[Benjamin Franklin]], became the leader of the Loyalists after his release from a Patriot prison in 1778.  He worked to build Loyalist military units to fight in the war, but the number of volunteers was much fewer than London expected.\n\nWhen their cause was defeated, about 15 percent of the Loyalists (65,000\u201370,000 people) fled to other parts of the [[British Empire]], to Britain itself, or to [[British North America]] (now Canada).  The southern Loyalists moved mostly to Florida, which had remained loyal to the Crown, and to British Caribbean possessions, often bringing along their slaves.  Northern Loyalists largely migrated to [[Upper Canada|Ontario]], [[Lower Canada|Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]].  They called themselves [[United Empire Loyalist|United Empire Loyalists]].  Most were compensated with Canadian land or British cash distributed through formal claims procedures.  Loyalists who left the US received \u00a33 million{{citation needed|reason=Body of article says 3.5 millon; neither claims cites a source|date=May 2019}} or about 37% of their losses from the British government.

Others recalled the dreadful experiences of many [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebels after the failure of the last Jacobite rebellion as recently as 1745 who often lost their lands when the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] government won.<ref>See also N.

Elsewhere there were few British troops and the Patriots seized control of all levels of government, as well as supplies of arms and gunpowder. Vocal Loyalists recruited people to their side, often with the encouragement and assistance of royal governors. In the South Carolina back country, Loyalist recruitment oustripped that of Patriots. A [[Siege of Savage's Old Fields|brief siege]] at [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]] in the fall of 1775 was followed by a rapid rise in Patriot recruiting, and a [[Snow Campaign]] involving thousands of partisan militia resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the back country Loyalist leadership. North Carolina back country Scots and former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] joined forces in early 1776, but they were broken as a force at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]].\n\nBy July 4, 1776, the Patriots had gained control of virtually all territory in the Thirteen Colonies and expelled all royal officials. No one who openly proclaimed their loyalty to the Crown was allowed to remain, so Loyalists fled or kept quiet. Some of those who remained later gave aid to invading British armies or joined uniformed Loyalist regiments.<ref>Calhoun (1973){{Page needed|date=January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe British were forced out of Boston by March 17, 1776. They regrouped at Halifax and attacked [[Province of New York|New York]] in August, defeating [[George Washington]]'s army at [[Long Island]] and capturing [[New York City]] and its vicinity, and they occupied the mouth of the [[Hudson River]] until 1783. British forces seized control of other cities, including [[Philadelphia]] (1777), [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1778\u201383), and [[Charleston, South Carolina]] (1780\u201382). But 90% of the colonial population lived outside the cities, with the effective result that Congress represented 80 to 90 percent of the population. The British removed their governors from colonies where the Patriots were in control, but Loyalist civilian government was re-established in coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]<ref name = \"Gerogian\">[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2709 Georgia Encyclop\u00e6dia].</ref> from 1779 to 1782, despite presence of Patriot forces in the northern part of Georgia. Essentially, the British were only able to maintain power in areas where they had a strong military presence.\n\n===Numbers of Loyalists===\nHistorian Robert Calhoon wrote in 2000, concerning the proportion of Loyalists to Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies:\n\n{{quote|Historians' best estimates put the proportion of adult white male loyalists somewhere between 15 and 20 percent. Approximately half the colonists of European ancestry tried to avoid involvement in the struggle\u2014some of them deliberate pacifists, others recent immigrants, and many more simple apolitical folk. The patriots received active support from perhaps 40 to 45 percent of the white populace, and at most no more than a bare majority.<ref>Robert M.

Many active [[Church of England]] members became Loyalists. Some recent arrivals from Britain, especially those from Scotland, had a high Loyalist proportion. Loyalists in the southern colonies were suppressed by the local Patriots, who controlled local and state government. Many people\u2014including former [[War of the Regulation|Regulators]] in [[History of North Carolina|North Carolina]] \u2014 refused to join the rebellion, as they had earlier protested against corruption by local authorities who later became Revolutionary leaders. The oppression by the local [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]] during the Regulation led to many of the residents of backcountry North Carolina sitting out the Revolution or siding with the Loyalists.<ref name=\"Calhoon 1973\"/>\n\nIn areas under Patriot control, Loyalists were subject to [[Confiscation|confiscation of property]], and outspoken supporters of the king were threatened with public humiliation such as [[tarring and feathering]], or physical attack. It is not known how many Loyalist civilians were harassed by the Patriots, but the treatment was a warning to other Loyalists not to take up arms. In September 1775, [[William Drayton]] and Loyalist leader Colonel Thomas Fletchall signed a treaty of neutrality in the interior community of [[Ninety Six, South Carolina|Ninety Six]], [[South Carolina]].<ref>See [http://www.nps.gov/revwar/revolution_day_by_day/1775_main.html online NPS.gov]</ref> For actively aiding the British army when it occupied Philadelphia, two residents of the city were tried for treason, convicted, and executed by returning Patriot forces.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis P.

Many of the slaves in the South joined the Loyalists with intentions of gaining freedom and escaping the South. About 800 did so; some helped rout the Virginia militia at the [[Battle of Kemp's Landing]] and fought in the [[Battle of Great Bridge]] on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], wearing the motto \"Liberty to Slaves\", but this time they were defeated. The remains of their regiment were then involved in the evacuation of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], after which they served in the [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] area. Eventually the camp that they had set up there suffered an outbreak of smallpox and other diseases. This took a heavy toll, putting many of them out of action for some time. The survivors joined other British units and continued to serve throughout the war. Black colonials were often the first to come forward to volunteer and a total of 12,000 African Americans served with the British from 1775 to 1783. This forced the rebels to also offer freedom to those who would serve in the Continental Army; however, such promises were often reneged upon by both sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117055926/http://www.blackloyalist.com/canadiandigitalcollection/story/revolution/philipsburg.htm |archivedate=2007-11-17 }}</ref>\n\nAmericans who gained their freedom by fighting for the British became known as [[Black Loyalist|Black Loyalists]]. The British honored the pledge of freedom in New York City through the efforts of General [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]], who recorded the names of African Americans who had supported the British in a document called the [[Book of Negroes]], which granted freedom to slaves who had escaped and assisted the British. About 4,000 Black Loyalists went to the British colonies of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]], where the British promised them land. They founded communities across the two provinces, many of which still exist today. Over 2,500 settled in [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], instantly making it the largest [[Free Negro|free black]] community in North America. However, the inferior grants of land they were given and the prejudices of white Loyalists in nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]] who regularly harassed the settlement in events such as the [[Shelburne riots|Shelburne Riots]] in 1784, made life very difficult for the community.<ref name=\"blackloyalist.com\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20021110054520/http://www.blackloyalist.com/historypage2.html]</ref> In 1791 Britain's [[Sierra Leone Company]] offered to transport dissatisfied black Loyalists to the British colony of [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa, with the promise of better land and more equality.

However, many of Quebec's inhabitants remained neutral, resisting service to either the British or the Americans.\n\nAlthough some Canadians took up arms in support of the rebellion, the majority remained loyal to the King. [[French Canadians]] had been satisfied by the British government's [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, which offered religious and linguistic toleration; in general, they did not sympathize with a rebellion that they saw as being led by Protestants from [[New England]], who were their commercial rivals and hereditary enemies. Most of the [[English language|English-speaking]] settlers had arrived following the British [[Conquest of 1760|conquest of Canada]] in 1759\u20131760, and were unlikely to support separation from Britain. The older British colonies, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]] (including what is now [[New Brunswick]]) also remained loyal and contributed military forces in support of the Crown.\n\nIn late 1775 the [[Continental Army]] [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|sent a force into Quebec]], led by General [[Richard Montgomery]] and Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]], with the goal of convincing the residents of Quebec to join the Revolution. Although only a minority of Canadians openly expressed loyalty to King George, about 1,500 militia fought for the King in the [[Siege of Fort St. Jean]]. In the region south of Montreal that was occupied by the Continentals, some inhabitants supported the rebellion and raised two regiments to join the Patriot forces.<ref name = \"Wade\">Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians'' (1955) 1:67\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn [[Nova Scotia]], there were many Yankee settlers originally from New England, and they generally supported the principles of the revolution. The allegiance toward the rebellion waned as American Privateers [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution|raided Nova Scotia communities]] throughout the war. As well, the Nova Scotia government used the law to convict people for sedition and treason for supporting the rebel cause. There was also the influence of an influx of recent immigration from the British isles, and they remained neutral during the war, and the influx was greatest in Halifax.<ref>George Rawlyck, ''A People Highly Favoured Of God.

There would be no further serious attempt to challenge British control of present-day Canada until the [[War of 1812]].\n\nIn 1777, 1,500 Loyalist militia took part in the [[Saratoga campaign]] in New York, and surrendered with General [[John Burgoyne|Burgoyne]] after the [[Battles of Saratoga]] in October.  For the rest of the war, Quebec acted as a base for raiding expeditions, conducted primarily by Loyalists and Indians, against frontier communities.\n\n===Military service===\n{{Main|Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution}}\n\nThe Loyalists rarely attempted any political organization. They were often passive unless regular British army units were in the area. The British, however, assumed a highly activist Loyalist community was ready to mobilize and planned much of their strategy around raising Loyalist regiments. The British provincial line, consisting of Americans enlisted on a regular army status, enrolled 19,000 Loyalists (50 units and 312 companies). The maximum strength of the Loyalist provincial line was 9,700 in December 1780.<ref>Smith 264\u20137.</ref><ref name=\"Calhoon502\">Calhoon 502.</ref> In all about 19,000 at one time or another were soldiers or militia in British forces.<ref>Smith, p 267</ref>  Loyalists from South Carolina fought for the British in the [[Battle of Camden]].

The exiles amounted to about 2% of the total US population of 3 million at the end of the war in 1783.\n\nAfter 1783 some former Loyalists, especially Germans from Pennsylvania, emigrated to Canada to take advantage of the British government's offer of free land.

An imperial law in 1790 assured prospective immigrants to Canada that their slaves would remain their property.<ref>Patrick Bode, \"Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves.\" ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17\u201319</ref>\n\nThousands of [[Iroquois]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were expelled from New York and other states and resettled in Canada. The descendants of one such group of Iroquois, led by [[Joseph Brant]] (Thayendenegea), settled at [[Six Nations of the Grand River]], the largest [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserve]] in Canada. (The remainder, under the leadership of [[Cornplanter]] (John Abeel) and members of his family, stayed in New York.) A group of African-American Loyalists settled in Nova Scotia but emigrated again for [[Sierra Leone]] after facing [[discrimination]] there.\n\nMany of the Loyalists were forced to abandon substantial properties to America restoration of or compensation for these lost properties was a major issue during the negotiation of the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1794. The British Government eventually settled several thousand claims for more than 3.5 million Pounds Sterling,{{citation needed|reason=Lead says 3.0 million; neither cites a reference|date=May 2019}} an enormous sum of money worth at that time.\n\n==Return of some expatriates==\nThe great majority of Loyalists never left the United States; they stayed on and were allowed to be citizens of the new country. Some became nationally prominent leaders, including [[Samuel Seabury]], who was the first Bishop of the Episcopal Church, and [[Tench Coxe]]. There was a small, but significant trickle of returnees who found life in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick too difficult. Perhaps 10% of the refugees to New Brunswick returned to the States as did an unknown number from Nova Scotia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Christopher |title=The Loyalists : revolution, exile, settlement |date=1984 |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |isbn=978-0771060939 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/loyalists00chri/page/244 244\u2013252] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/loyalists00chri/page/244 }}</ref>  Some Massachusetts Tories settled in the Maine District. Nevertheless, the vast majority never returned. Captain Benjamin Hallowell, who as Mandamus Councilor in Massachusetts served as the direct representative of the Crown, was considered by the insurgents as one of the most hated men in the Colony, but as a token of compensation when he returned from England in 1796, his son was allowed to regain the family house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jphs.org/colonial/capt-benjamin-hallowell-homestead.html|title=Jamaica Plain Historical Society - 'Colonial Era' Editor - - Capt Benjamin Hallowell Homestead|website=www.jphs.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904235939/http://www.jphs.org/colonial/capt-benjamin-hallowell-homestead.html|archivedate=2008-09-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexander Hamilton]] enlisted the help of the Tories (ex-Loyalists) in New York in 1782\u201385 to forge an alliance with moderate Whigs to wrest the State from the power of the [[George Clinton (vice president)|Clinton]] faction. Moderate Whigs in other States who had not been in favor of separation from Britain but preferred a negotiated settlement which would have maintained ties to the Mother Country mobilized to block radicals. Most States had rescinded anti-Tory laws by 1787, although the accusation of being a Tory was heard for another generation. Several hundred who had left for Florida returned to Georgia in 1783\u201384. South Carolina which had seen a bitter bloody internal civil war in 1780-82 adopted a policy of reconciliation that proved more moderate than any other state. About 4500 white Loyalists left when the war ended, but the majority remained behind. The state government successfully and quickly reincorporated the vast majority. During the war, pardons were offered to Loyalists who switched sides and joined the Patriot forces. Others were required to pay a 10% fine of the value of the property.  The legislature named 232 Loyalists liable for confiscation of their property, but most appealed and were forgiven.<ref>Rebecca Brannon, ''From Revolution to Reunion: The Reintegration of the South Carolina Loyalists'' (Univ of South Carolina Press, 2016).</ref> In Connecticut much to the disgust of the Radical Whigs the moderate Whigs were advertising in New York newspapers in 1782-83 that Tories who would make no trouble would be welcome on the grounds that their skills and money would help the State's economy. The Moderates prevailed. All anti-Tory laws were repealed in early 1783 except for the law relating to confiscated Tory estates: \"... the problem of the loyalists after 1783 was resolved in their favor after the War of Independence ended.\" In 1787 the last of any discriminatory laws were rescinded.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zeichner |first1=Oscar |title=The Rehabilitation of Loyalists in Connecticut |journal=The New England Quarterly |date=June 1938 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=308\u2013330|doi=10.2307/360711 |jstor=360711 }}</ref>\n\n==Impact of the departure of Loyalist leaders==\nThe departure of so many royal officials, rich merchants and landed gentry destroyed the hierarchical networks that had dominated most of the colonies.  A major result was that a Patriot/Whig elite supplanted royal officials and affluent Tories.<ref>The Forging of the New Nation, 1781-1789, Robert B. Morris, 1987, p. 163.</ref>  In New York, the departure of key members of the De Lancey, De Peyster, Walton and Cruger families undercut the interlocking families that largely owned and controlled the Hudson Valley.  Likewise in Pennsylvania, the departure of powerful families\u2014Penn, Allen, Chew, Shippen\u2014destroyed the cohesion of the old upper class there.  Massachusetts passed an act banishing forty-six Boston merchants in 1778, including members of some of Boston's wealthiest families.  The departure of families such as the Ervings, Winslows, Clarks, and Lloyds deprived Massachusetts of men who had hitherto been leaders of networks of family and clients. The bases of the men who replaced them were much different.  One rich Patriot in Boston noted in 1779 that \"fellows who would have cleaned my shoes five years ago, have amassed fortunes and are riding in chariots.\"  New men became rich merchants but they shared a spirit of republican equality that replaced the former elitism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon S.

Indeed, the king replaced the pope as the demon Patriots had to fight against.  Anti-Catholicism remained strong among Loyalists, some of whom went to Canada after the war most remained in the new nation.  By the 1780s, Catholics were extended legal toleration in all of the New England states that previously had been so hostile. \"In the midst of war and crisis, New Englanders gave up not only their allegiance to Britain but one of their most dearly held prejudices.\"<ref>Francis Cogliano, ''No King, No Popery: Anti-Catholicism in Revolutionary New England'' (1995) pp 154-55, quote p 155.

Both parishes separated from St. James (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.<ref>Leslie Buck (2019), ''Peace be to the whole community: The story of St Paul's Anglican Church in the West End of Vancouver'', Vancouver: Second City Print Solutions, {{ISBN|978-1-77136-761-5}}.</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n=== Church buildings ===\nThe first church building was located at the centre of the parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 7</ref>  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.[[File:St Paul's new and old churches 1905.jpg|thumb|The new church on the site of the old church with the old church re-located alongside to become the parish hall, 1905]]  \n\nThe new church had eighteen windows (not including clerestory windows), all except three glazed with leaded lights.  Stained glass was fitted in windows in the east wall (portraying St Paul preaching in Athens), the west wall (St Peter with Dorcas doing good works), and the north transept (Faith, Hope and Charity).  Between 1952 and 1964, nine more windows were fitted with stained glass, all in some way portraying Christ.  Until 1952, the only portrayal of Christ in the church had been a print showing Jesus as a small boy.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 16.</ref>\n\nThe church pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, is said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 15.</ref>\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration,<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 4.</ref> except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 36.</ref>\n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism, and finances, revived after the Second World War and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church burns the mortgage, 1945.jpg|thumb|Godfrey Gower (centre) and parish officials burn the mortgage on the parish hall, 1945]]  \n\nDuring the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.<ref>Buck, op.cit, page 31.</ref>[[File:The Pendrellis entrance Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Entrance to The Pendrellis apartment building on Pendrell Street next to the church.]]  \n\n=== Parish activities ===\nThe first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908) during whose incumbency the new church was built.  He was followed by Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving reactor, Harold King (1914 - 1944).  As the Second World War ended Godfrey Gower (1944 \u2013 1951) became rector, resigning to become Bishop of New Westminster<ref>https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca/diocesan-profile/our-history, accessed 19 April 2020.</ref>, and he was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  \n\nFrom its founding, the parish thrived by serving a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  The parish followed a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and sponsored well-supported educational and social activities like Sunday Schools, Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nLiturgical practice tended to be conservative.  The introduction of a processional cross in 1931 was contentious,<ref>Parish Archives Folder D22/1.6, Minutes dated 20 April 1931.</ref> and even more so was the introduction of women into the choir in 1933.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 42.</ref> \n\n\n\n== Post-1980 changes ==\n\nAs the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.<ref>Parish Archives, Folder D11/2.1.</ref>  The situation was summarised thus: \n\n<blockquote>\"In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\" <ref>Buck, op.cit., page 50.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1985, David Crawley (1985\u20131990) was appointed rector.<ref>Crawley subsequently became Bishop of Kootenay (1990 - 2004) and then concurrently Archbishop of British Columbia and Yukon (1994 - 2004).</ref>, setting in process significant reforms of pastoral ministries and liturgical practices.  \n\n=== New ministries ===\n\nForemost of all, Crawley initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community,<ref>David Crawley, \"A Parish Transformed\".  In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.  He and his assistant priest, Neil Gray who became Crawley' successor (1991 - 2003), opened up the parish to the wider community and co-operated with other agencies like St Paul's Hospital<ref>The sharing of the name is quite coincidental.</ref> and AIDS Vancouver.<ref>Buck, Op.cit., page 73.</ref>  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: \"St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul\"<ref>Crawley, op.cit., page 207.</ref>\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Gray set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  \n\nThe result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion, meriting among other responses a rebuke from the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.  Ingham expressed his own position thus:\n\n<blockquote>\"In many places around the world homosexual people are still treated as criminals and even worse, and in some instances with the support of the church.  We regret this [. . . ] and express our sadness and disquiet at their suffering, and hope that our actions in this part of the world may bring comfort and relief to those millions of people who look to the church for safety and support instead of judgement and condemnation.\"<ref>Minutes of the 101st Diocesan Synod, 2003.  Synod Journal, 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.  From its inception, the program has been operated by a salaried director and volunteer associates (most of whom are not members of the parish), conducting as many as four thousand interviews in a year with clients from a wide area.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>[[File:St Paul's Labyrinth, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The way into the Labyrinth]]  \n\n=== Liturgical developments ===\n\nSignificant changes to liturgical practices began in 1981 when a contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used at St Paul's for the first time.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 48.</ref>  In 1986, a Eucharistic celebration additional to the traditional early-morning celebration (using the Book of Common Prayer) was introduced using the Book of Alternative Services.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 49.</ref>  At the same time the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer at the principal Sunday morning service, the latter being used for the last time in Epiphany 1995.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 55.</ref>\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004 \u2013 2012), made decreasing use of the Book of Common Prayer at the principal Sunday morning service, cutting back to three times a year by 2013.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 56.</ref>  In 2014, when D\u00fcnzkofer's successor, Jessica Schaap (2013 \u2013 2017), discontinued the early-morning celebration for lack of attendance, the Book of Common Prayer ceased to be used at all in a regular manner.  \n\nIn 1986, Crawley moved the high altar away from the east wall so that the celebrant could face the people.  He also introduced a portable altar which could be placed in the chancel or the nave, and he and his successors made inceasing use of it for celebrating Eucharist in a more intimate manner.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 52.</ref>\n\nOther changes made during this period included installing icons and an aumbry for the Reserved Sacrament, and introducing practices like Exchanging the Peace, all of which increased the level of participation in the Eucharistic celebration by members of the congregation.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 7,</ref> \n\nIn 1976, the then Bishop of New Westminster, David Somerville, ordained women as priests for the first time in the diocese.  In 1982, Barbara Blakely became the first woman priest to celebrate Eucharist at St Paul's.  Helen Patterson was the first woman to be appointed to staff, and she was succeeded as assistant priest by several other women.  In 2013, Jessica Schaap (2013 \u2013 2017) became the first woman to be appointed rector.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 45.\n</ref>[[File:Anglican woman priest with women acolytes.jpg|thumb|Jessica Schapp, assisted by two laywomen, celebrates Eucharist at an altar placed at the head of the nave]] \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://stpaulsanglican.bc.ca/ St. Paul's Anglican Church]\n\n{{coord|49.28321|N|123.13385|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Anglican Church (Vancouver)}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1905]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1881]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church Vancouver BC.jpg|thumb|St Paul's church with the parish hall (right) and the Pendrellis apartment building (left), 2015]]\n{{Infobox church\n| church name = St Paul's Anglican Church\n| denomination = Anglican Church of Canada\n| country = Canada\n| location = Vancouver, British Columbia\n| deanery = Kingsway\n| archdeaconry = Burrard\n| province = Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and the Yukon\n| diocese = New Westminster\n| archbishop = The Most Rev'd Melissa Skelton, Archbishop of New Westminster\n| rector = The Rev'd Philip Cochrane\n| asstpriest = \n}}\n'''St. Paul's Anglican Church''' (established 1889) serves the south-west downtown peninsula of Vancouver, British Columbia, (the West End and Yaletown neighbourhoods) alongside Christ Church Cathedral (established 1888) serving the north-east (Downtown and Coal Harbour neighbourhoods).
