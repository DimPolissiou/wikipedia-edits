Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social Security benefits are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.<ref>U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee.

This law extended the statute of limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman at the end of her career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.\n\nIn June 2017, Governor [[Kate Brown]] signed into law the Oregon Equal Pay Act, which forbids employers from using job seekers' prior salaries in hiring decisions.<ref>{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=Recent Legislation: Oregon Bans Employers from Asking Job Applicants About Prior Salary| volume=131| journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv.

They investigated whether participants would assign different pay to 3 types of jobs wherein the actual responsibilities and duties carried out by men and women were the same, but the job was situated in either a traditionally masculine or traditionally feminine domain. The researchers found statistically significant pay differentials between jobs defined as \"male\" and \"female,\" which suggest that gender-based discrimination, arising from occupational stereotyping and the devaluation of the work typically done by women, influences salary allocation.

Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.<ref>Bakalar, Nicholas. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/health/research/23perc.html?ref=science A Customer Bias in Favor of White Men.]\" ''New York Times'', June 23, 2009.</ref><ref>Vedantam, Shankar. \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/31/AR2009053102081.html Caveat for Employers.]\" ''Washington Post'', June 1, 2009.</ref><ref>Jackson, Derrick. \"[https://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2009/07/06/subtle_and_stubborn_race_bias/ Subtle, and stubborn, race bias.]\" ''Boston Globe'', July 6, 2009.</ref><ref>National Public Radio, [http://www.wuwm.com/programs/lake_effect/view_le.php?articleid=754 Lake Effect]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hekman |first1=David R. |last2=Aquino |first2=Karl |last3=Owens |first3=Bradley P. |last4=Mitchell |first4=Terence R. |last5=Schilpzand |first5=Pauline |last6=Leavitt |first6=Keith |year=2010 |title=An Examination of Whether and How Racial and Gender Biases Influence Customer Satisfaction |journal=Academy of Management Journal |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=238\u201364 |doi=10.5465/AMJ.2010.49388763|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/970ed400669c4b7f6b5878ae4301481a416c2ce9 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, a study (2000) conducted by economic experts [[Claudia Goldin]] from [[Harvard University]] and [[Cecilia Rouse]] from [[Princeton University]] shows that when evaluators of applicants could see the applicant's gender they were more likely to select men.

Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination.

Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.<ref>Laura Bassett (October 24, 2012) [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/gender-wage-gap-economic-stimulus_n_2007588.html \"Closing The Gender Wage Gap Would Create 'Huge' Economic Stimulus, Economists Say\"] ''Huffington Post''</ref>\n\n===Pensions===\nAccording to a report by the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]], the gender pay gap jeopardizes women's retirement security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social Security benefits are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.<ref>U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee.

This law extended the statute of limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman at the end of her career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.\n\nIn June 2017, Governor [[Kate Brown]] signed into law the Oregon Equal Pay Act, which forbids employers from using job seekers' prior salaries in hiring decisions.<ref>{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=Recent Legislation: Oregon Bans Employers from Asking Job Applicants About Prior Salary| volume=131| journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv.
