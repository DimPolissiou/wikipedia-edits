Modern colonial empires first emerged with a race of exploration between the then most advanced [[Europe]]an maritime powers, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], during the 15th century.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"kolonie [geschiedenis]. \u00a71.2 De moderne koloniale expansie\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref> The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was [[trade]], driven by the new ideas and the [[capitalism]] that grew out of the European [[Renaissance]]. Agreements were also made to divide the world up between them in [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas|1479]], [[Inter caetera|1493]], and [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494]]. European [[imperialism]] was born out of competition between European Christians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Muslims, the latter of which rose up quickly in the 14th century and forced the Spanish and Portuguese to seek new trade routes to [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and to a lesser extent, China.\n\nAlthough [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies existed]] in [[classical antiquity]], especially amongst the [[Phoenicians]] and the [[Ancient Greeks]] who settled many islands and coasts of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], these colonies were politically independent from the [[City-state|city-states]] they originated from, and thus did not constitute a colonial empire.<ref>Encarta, s.v. \"kolonie [geschiedenis]. \u00a71.1 Oudheid.</ref>\n\n== European colonial empires ==\n\nPortugal began establishing the first global trade network and one of the first colonial [[Portuguese Empire|empires]] (Together with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/concise-history-of-spain/spain-as-the-first-global-empire/F7B8F313785D9617BA12636F41696996#|title=Spain as the first global empire|first1=Jr|last1=William D.

The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories distributed across the globe (especially at one time in the 16th century) that are now parts of [[Evolution of the Portuguese Empire#Countries with territories part of the Portuguese Empire|60 different sovereign states]]. Portugal would eventually control [[Brazil]], territories such as what is now [[Colonia del Sacramento|Uruguay]] and some fishing ports in north, in the [[Americas]]; [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (among other territories and bases) in the [[North Africa|North]] and the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Subsaharan]] [[Africa]]; cities, forts or territories in all the [[Asia]]n Subcontinents, as [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Ormus]] and [[Bahrain]] (amongst other bases) in the [[Persian Gulf]]; [[Goa]], [[Bombay]] and [[Daman and Diu]] (amongst other coastal cities) in [[Portuguese India|India]]; [[Portuguese Ceylon]]; [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], bases in Southeast Asia and [[Oceania]], as [[Makassar]], [[Solor]], [[Banda Islands|Banda]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and others in the [[Moluccas]], [[Portuguese Timor]]; and the granted ''entrep\u00f4t''-base of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and the entrep\u00f4t-enclave of [[Dejima]] ([[Nagasaki]]) in [[East Asia]], amongst other smaller or short-lived possessions. \n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=3.4|{{center|The territorial evolution of modern colonial empires and some of their successor states (such as USSR, Turkey)}}]]\n\nDuring its ''[[Siglo de Oro]]'', the [[Spanish Empire]] had possession of [[Mexico]], [[South America]], the [[Philippines]], all of [[southern Italy]], a [[Spanish road|stretch of territories]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]] to the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Belgium]], parts of [[Burgundy]], and many colonial settlements in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Possessions in Europe, Africa, the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Americas, the [[Pacific Ocean]], and East Asia qualified the Spanish Empire as attaining a global presence. From 1580 to 1640 the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the Spanish Empire were conjoined in a [[personal union]] of its [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg monarchs]] during the period of the ''Iberian Union'', but beneath the highest level of government, their separate administrations were maintained.\n\nSubsequent colonial empires included the [[List of French possessions and colonies|French]], [[English overseas possessions|English]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] empires. By the mid-17th century, the [[Tsardom of Russia]], continued later as the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]], became the largest contiguous state in the world, and the modern [[Russian Federation]] continues to be so to this day. Russia today has nine [[time zones]], stretching across about half of the world's longitude.\n\nThe [[British Empire]], consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history by virtue of the improved transportation technologies of the time. At its height, the British Empire covered a quarter of the [[Earth]]'s land area and comprised a quarter of its population. During the [[New Imperialism]], Italy and Germany also built their [[Scramble for Africa|colonial empires in Africa]].\n\nIt is worth noting that, from the 16th to 19th century, there were also large non-European empires, most notably the Qing Empire of China, which conquered a huge area of East and Inner Asia, and the three [[Gunpowder empires]] of Mughal India, Ottoman Turkey, and Savafid Iran.

collective of territories (often called [[colony|colonies]]), either contiguous with the imperial center or located [[overseas]], [[Plantation (settlement or colony)|settled]] by the population of a certain [[Sovereign state|state]] and governed by that state.\n\nBefore the expansion of early modern European powers, other empires had conquered and colonized territory, such as the Romans in Iberia, or the Chinese in what is now south China. Modern colonial empires first emerged with a race of exploration between the then most advanced [[Europe]]an maritime powers, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], during the 15th century.<ref>Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993\u20132002) s.v. \"kolonie [geschiedenis]. \u00a71.2 De moderne koloniale expansie\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.</ref> The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was [[trade]], driven by the new ideas and the [[capitalism]] that grew out of the European [[Renaissance]]. Agreements were also made to divide the world up between them in [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas|1479]], [[Inter caetera|1493]], and [[Treaty of Tordesillas|1494]]. European [[imperialism]] was born out of competition between European Christians and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Muslims, the latter of which rose up quickly in the 14th century and forced the Spanish and Portuguese to seek new trade routes to [[Indian subcontinent|India]], and to a lesser extent, China.\n\nAlthough [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies existed]] in [[classical antiquity]], especially amongst the [[Phoenicians]] and the [[Ancient Greeks]] who settled many islands and coasts of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], these colonies were politically independent from the [[City-state|city-states]] they originated from, and thus did not constitute a colonial empire.<ref>Encarta, s.v. \"kolonie [geschiedenis]. \u00a71.1 Oudheid.</ref>\n\n== European colonial empires ==\n\nPortugal began establishing the first global trade network and one of the first colonial [[Portuguese Empire|empires]] (Together with the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/concise-history-of-spain/spain-as-the-first-global-empire/F7B8F313785D9617BA12636F41696996#|title=Spain as the first global empire|first1=Jr|last1=William D.

The empire spread throughout a vast number of territories distributed across the globe (especially at one time in the 16th century) that are now parts of [[Evolution of the Portuguese Empire#Countries with territories part of the Portuguese Empire|60 different sovereign states]]. Portugal would eventually control [[Brazil]], territories such as what is now [[Colonia del Sacramento|Uruguay]] and some fishing ports in north, in the [[Americas]]; [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (among other territories and bases) in the [[North Africa|North]] and the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Subsaharan]] [[Africa]]; cities, forts or territories in all the [[Asia]]n Subcontinents, as [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Ormus]] and [[Bahrain]] (amongst other bases) in the [[Persian Gulf]]; [[Goa]], [[Bombay]] and [[Daman and Diu]] (amongst other coastal cities) in [[Portuguese India|India]]; [[Portuguese Ceylon]]; [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], bases in Southeast Asia and [[Oceania]], as [[Makassar]], [[Solor]], [[Banda Islands|Banda]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and others in the [[Moluccas]], [[Portuguese Timor]]; and the granted ''entrep\u00f4t''-base of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and the entrep\u00f4t-enclave of [[Dejima]] ([[Nagasaki]]) in [[East Asia]], amongst other smaller or short-lived possessions. \n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=3.4|{{center|The territorial evolution of modern colonial empires and some of their successor states (such as USSR, Turkey)}}]]\n\nDuring its ''[[Siglo de Oro]]'', the [[Spanish Empire]] had possession of [[Mexico]], [[South America]], the [[Philippines]], all of [[southern Italy]], a [[Spanish road|stretch of territories]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]] to the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Belgium]], parts of [[Burgundy]], and many colonial settlements in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Possessions in Europe, Africa, the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Americas, the [[Pacific Ocean]], and East Asia qualified the Spanish Empire as attaining a global presence. From 1580 to 1640 the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the Spanish Empire were conjoined in a [[personal union]] of its [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg monarchs]] during the period of the ''Iberian Union'', but beneath the highest level of government, their separate administrations were maintained.\n\nSubsequent colonial empires included the [[List of French possessions and colonies|French]], [[English overseas possessions|English]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] empires. By the mid-17th century, the [[Tsardom of Russia]], continued later as the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]], became the largest contiguous state in the world, and the modern [[Russian Federation]] continues to be so to this day. Russia today has nine [[time zones]], stretching across about half of the world's longitude.\n\nThe [[British Empire]], consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history by virtue of the improved transportation technologies of the time. At its height, the British Empire covered a quarter of the [[Earth]]'s land area and comprised a quarter of its population. During the [[New Imperialism]], Italy and Germany also built their [[Scramble for Africa|colonial empires in Africa]].\n\nIt is worth noting that, from the 16th to 19th century, there were also large non-European empires, most notably the Qing Empire of China, which conquered a huge area of East and Inner Asia, and the three [[Gunpowder empires]] of Mughal India, Ottoman Turkey, and Savafid Iran. The British replaced the Mughals in India, and after the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1901, [[History of China#Imperial China|Imperial China]] made concessions to the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] (all the [[Great Powers]] of the time). By the end of the 20th century most of the previous colonial empires had been [[Decolonization|decolonized]], though the modern nation states of Russia and China inherited much of the territory of the Romanov and Qing empires, respectively.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{factual accuracy|date=January 2018}}\nThe chart below shows the span of some European colonial empires. \n* Black lines mark the year of

While many dialects of [[English language|English]] make use of diminutives, Australian English uses them more extensively than any other. Diminutives may be seen as [[slang]], but many forms are used widely across the whole of society. Some forms have also spread outside Australia to other English speaking countries.<ref name=smh>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/australian-slang-is-not-dying-its-making-its-way-up-in-the-world-20150529-ghamt6.html|title=Australian slang is not dying, it's making its way up in the world}}</ref> There are over 5,000 identified diminutives in use in Australian English.<ref name=ag>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2010/08/why-we-shorten-barbie,-footy-and-arvo|title=Why we shorten barbie, footy and arvo|work=australiangeographic.com.au}}</ref><ref name=adu>http://alldownunder.com/australian-slang/dictionary-diminutives.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2012/09/06/3584725.htm|title=A word in your ear: Diminutives|work=abc.net.au}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Kevin Rudd World Economic Forum 2013.jpg|thumb|Former Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] is well known for using Australian colloquialisms such as diminutives.]]\n\nIn Australian English, diminutives are usually formed by taking the first part of a word, and adding an ''a'', ''o'', ''ie'', or ''y''. Alternatively in some cases no ending may be added. While the form of a diminutive is arbitrary, their use follows strict rules. Diminutives are not used creatively. For example, an ambulance paramedic is called an ''ambo'', and is never pronounced ''ambie'' or ''amba''. The use of the ''-ie'' ending, for example in ''bikie'' (a motorcycle club member), does not carry a connotation of smallness or cuteness as it does in other English dialects.\n\nSome diminutives are almost always used in preference to the original form, while some are rarely used. Others might be restricted to certain demographic groups or locations. The use of diminutives also evolves over time with new words coming into use and falling out of favour. Some diminutives have become so common that the original form has fallen out of common usage. For example, ''Salvos'' has begun to replace the name ''[[Salvation Army]]'' to such an extent that some Australians do not recognise the Salvation Army name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2011/podcasts/how-australians-use-hypocoristics/transcript|title=Transcript|work=latrobe.edu.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2010/07/aussies-diminutives.html|title=Aussies diminutives|work=ABC Sydney|access-date=2014-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020035834/http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2010/07/aussies-diminutives.html|archive-date=2014-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Deli'' has become so universal that ''[[delicatessen#Australia|delicatessen]]'' is rarely used. Some words, such as ''ute'', from utility vehicle, a car with a tray back, have become universal.\n\nThere is common usage of the diminutive forms of people's names; Hargrave \u2192 Hargie; Wilkinson \u2192 Wilko; John \u2192 Jonno; David \u2192 Davo; Hogan \u2192 Hoges; James \u2192 Jimmy \u2192 Jim \u2192 Jimbo; Benjamin \u2192 Ben \u2192 Benno; Barry \u2192 Bazza. This is usually a display of affection and acceptance rather than belittlement.\n\nOrganizations and businesses will often embrace the diminutives given to them by Australians, using them in their own advertising and even registering it as a trademark. [[McDonald's]] Australia, for example, has registered and uses the name ''Macca's'', rather than the term ''McDonald's'' still seen on its restaurants in Australia.\n\nSome diminutives are rarely used, but widely recognised. For example, ''chalkie'' means ''teacher'', but most Australians simply call a teacher a teacher.\n\nDiminutives are often used for place names, and are only recognised by people in the local area, for example, ''cot'' for ''Cottesloe Beach'' in [[Perth]], ''Parra'' for ''Parramatta'' in [[Sydney]] and ''Broady'' for ''Broadmeadows'' in [[Melbourne]]. [[Pub]] and hotel names in particular are often shortened. For example, pubs called the Esplanade Hotel, such as the [[Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne)|Esplanade Hotel]] in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], will often be called ''The Espy''.\n\n==List of diminutives==\nThis list contains noteworthy and commonly understood diminutives from Australian English.\n\nThose marked \u2021 are also very common in British English.{{check|date=May 2018}}{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===A===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*'''Abo''', an [[indigenous Australian]].

Alternatively in some cases no ending may be added. While the form of a diminutive is arbitrary, their use follows strict rules. Diminutives are not used creatively. For example, an ambulance paramedic is called an ''ambo'', and is never pronounced ''ambie'' or ''amba''. The use of the ''-ie'' ending, for example in ''bikie'' (a motorcycle club member), does not carry a connotation of smallness or cuteness as it does in other English dialects.\n\nSome diminutives are almost always used in preference to the original form, while some are rarely used. Others might be restricted to certain demographic groups or locations. The use of diminutives also evolves over time with new words coming into use and falling out of favour. Some diminutives have become so common that the original form has fallen out of common usage. For example, ''Salvos'' has begun to replace the name ''[[Salvation Army]]'' to such an extent that some Australians do not recognise the Salvation Army name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2011/podcasts/how-australians-use-hypocoristics/transcript|title=Transcript|work=latrobe.edu.au}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2010/07/aussies-diminutives.html|title=Aussies diminutives|work=ABC Sydney|access-date=2014-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020035834/http://blogs.abc.net.au/nsw/2010/07/aussies-diminutives.html|archive-date=2014-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Deli'' has become so universal that ''[[delicatessen#Australia|delicatessen]]'' is rarely used. Some words, such as ''ute'', from utility vehicle, a car with a tray back, have become universal.\n\nThere is common usage of the diminutive forms of people's names; Hargrave \u2192 Hargie; Wilkinson \u2192 Wilko; John \u2192 Jonno; David \u2192 Davo; Hogan \u2192 Hoges; James \u2192 Jimmy \u2192 Jim \u2192 Jimbo; Benjamin \u2192 Ben \u2192 Benno; Barry \u2192 Bazza. This is usually a display of affection and acceptance rather than belittlement.\n\nOrganizations and businesses will often embrace the diminutives given to them by Australians, using them in their own advertising and even registering it as a trademark. [[McDonald's]] Australia, for example, has registered and uses the name ''Macca's'', rather than the term ''McDonald's'' still seen on its restaurants in Australia.\n\nSome diminutives are rarely used, but widely recognised. For example, ''chalkie'' means ''teacher'', but most Australians simply call a teacher a teacher.\n\nDiminutives are often used for place names, and are only recognised by people in the local area, for example, ''cot'' for ''Cottesloe Beach'' in [[Perth]], ''Parra'' for ''Parramatta'' in [[Sydney]] and ''Broady'' for ''Broadmeadows'' in [[Melbourne]]. [[Pub]] and hotel names in particular are often shortened.

This method works by analyzing the sequences as a whole, then utilizing the UPGMA/Neighbor-joining method to generate a distance matrix. A guide tree is then calculated from the scores of the sequences in the matrix, then subsequently used to build the multiple sequence alignment by progressively aligning the sequences in order of similarity.<ref name=\"CLUSTAL W Algorithm\">{{Cite web | url=https://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/clustalw/clustalw.html | title=CLUSTAL W Algorithm}}</ref> Essentially, Clustal creates multiple sequence alignments through three main steps:\n#Do a [[Sequence alignment|pairwise alignment]] using the progressive alignment method\n#Create a [[Molecular phylogenetics|guide tree]] (or use a user-defined tree)\n#Use the guide tree to carry out a multiple alignment\n\nThese steps are carried out automatically when you select \"Do Complete Alignment\".\nOther options are \"Do Alignment from guide tree and phylogeny\" and \"Produce guide tree only\".\n\n=== Input/Output ===\nThis program accepts a wide range of input formats, including NBRF/PIR, [[FASTA format|FASTA]], EMBL/[[UniProt|Swiss-Prot]], Clustal, GCC/MSF, GCG9 RSF, and GDE.\n\nThe output format can be one or many of the following: Clustal, NBRF/PIR, [[GCG (software)|GCG]]/MSF, [[PHYLIP]], GDE, or NEXUS.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nReading Multiple Sequence Alignment Output\n!Symbol\n!Definition\n!Meaning\n|-\n|*\n|asterisk\n|positions that have a single and fully conserved residue\n|-\n|:\n|colon\n|conservation between groups of strongly similar properties\nwith a score greater than .5 on the PAM 250 matrix\n|-\n|.\n|period\n|conservation between groups of weakly similar properties\nwith a score less than or equal to .5 on the PAM 250 matrix\n|}\nThe same symbols are shown for both DNA/RNA alignments and protein alignments, so while * (asterisk) symbols are useful to both, the other consensus symbols should be ignored for DNA/RNA alignments.\n\n=== Settings ===\nMany settings can be modified to adapt the alignment algorithm to different circumstances. The main parameters are the gap opening penalty, and the gap extension penalty.\n\n== Clustal and ClustalV ==\n=== Brief summary ===\nThe original program in the Clustal series of software was developed in 1988 as a way to generate multiple sequence alignments on personal computers. ClustalV was released 4 years later and greatly improved upon the original, adding and altering a few key features, including a switch to being written in C instead of Fortran like its predecessor.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nBoth versions use the same fast approximate algorithm to calculate the similarity scores between sequences, which in turn produces the pairwise alignments. The algorithm works by calculating the similarity scores as the number of k-tuple matches between two sequences, accounting for a set penalty for gaps. The more similar the sequences, the higher the score, the more divergent, the lower the scores. Once the sequences are scored, a [[dendrogram]] is generated through the UPGMA to represent the ordering of the multiple sequence alignment. The higher ordered sets of sequences are aligned first, followed by the rest in descending order. The algorithm allows for very large data sets, and works fast. However, the speed is dependent on the range for the k-tuple matches chosen for the particular sequence type.<ref name=\"aua.gr\">https://www.aua.gr/~eliop/mathimata/molevol/Askhsh1/clustalv.htm</ref>\n\n=== Notable ClustalV improvements ===\n\nSome of the most notable additions in ClustalV are profile alignments, and full command line interface options. The ability to use profile alignments allows the user to align two or more previous alignments or sequences to a new alignment and move misaligned sequences (low scored) further down the alignment order. This gives the user the option to gradually and methodically create multiple sequence alignments with more control than the basic option.<ref name=\"CLUSTAL W Algorithm\"/> The option to run from the command line greatly expedites the multiple sequence alignment process. Sequences can be run with a simple command,\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\"> clustalv nameoffile.seq </syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\"> clustalv /infile=nameoffile.seq </syntaxhighlight>\n\nand the program will determine what type of sequence it is analyzing. When the program is completed, the output of the multiple sequence alignment as well as the dendrogram go to files with .aln and .dnd extensions respectively. The command line interface uses the default parameters, and doesn't allow for other options.<ref name=\"aua.gr\"/>\n\n== ClustalW ==\n\n=== Brief summary ===\n[[File:Flowchart_for_ClustalW_Algorithm.svg|thumb|Depicts the steps the ClustalW software algorithm uses for global alignments]]\nClustalW like the other Clustal tools is used for aligning multiple nucleotide or protein sequences in an efficient manner. It uses progressive alignment methods, which align the most similar sequences first and work their way down to the least similar sequences until a global alignment is created. ClustalW is a matrix-based algorithm, whereas tools like [[T-Coffee]] and [[DIALIGN-T|Dialign]] are consistency-based. ClustalW has a fairly efficient algorithm that competes well against other software. This program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate a global alignment, for pairwise sequence alignment (2 sequences) use tools similar to [[EMBOSS]], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/lalign/ LALIGN].\n[[File:Neighbor_Joining_Phylogenetic_Tree.png|thumb|Diagram showing neighbor-joining method in sequence alignment for bioinformatics]]\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nClustalW uses progressive alignment methods as stated above. In these, the sequences with the best alignment score are aligned first, then progressively more distant groups of sequences are aligned. This heuristic approach is necessary due to the time and memory demand of finding the global optimal solution. The first step to the algorithm is computing a rough distance matrix between each pair of sequences, also known as [[Sequence alignment#Pairwise alignment|pairwise sequence alignment]]. The next step is a [[Neighbor joining|neighbor-joining method]] that uses midpoint rooting to create an overall guide tree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.megasoftware.net/web_help_7/hc_clustalw.htm|title=About CLUSTALW|website=www.megasoftware.net|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> The process it uses to do this is shown in the detailed diagram for the method to the right. The guide tree is then used as a rough template to generate a global alignment.\n\n=== Time complexity ===\nClustalW has a time complexity of <math>O(N^2)</math> because of its use of the neighbor-joining method. In the updated version (ClustalW2) there is an option built into the software to use [[UPGMA]] which is faster with large input sizes. The command line flag in order to use it instead of neighbor-joining is:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\">\n-clustering=UPGMA\n</syntaxhighlight>For example, on a standard desktop, running UPGMA on 10,000 sequences would produce results in less than a minute while neighbor-joining would take over an hour.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Larkin|first=M.A.|last2=Blackshields|first2=G.|last3=Brown|first3=N.P.|last4=Chenna|first4=R.|last5=McGettigan|first5=P.A.|last6=McWilliam|first6=H.|last7=Valentin|first7=F.|last8=Wallace|first8=I.M.|last9=Wilm|first9=A.|date=2007-09-10|title=Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=23|issue=21|pages=2947\u20132948|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm404|pmid=17846036|issn=1367-4803}}</ref> By running the ClustalW algorithm with this adjustment, it saves significant amounts of time.\n\nClustalW2 also has an option to use iterative alignment to increase alignment accuracy. While it is not necessarily faster or more efficient complexity-wise, the increase in accuracy is valuable and can be useful for smaller data sizes. These are the various command line flags to achieve this:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\">\n-Iteration=Alignment\n-Iteration=Tree\n-numiters\n\n</syntaxhighlight>The first command line option refines the final alignment. The second option incorporates the scheme into the progressive alignment step of the algorithm. The third specifies the number of iteration cycles where the default value is set to 3.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Accuracy and Results ===\nThe algorithm ClustalW uses provides a close-to-optimal result almost every time. However, it does exceptionally well when the data set contains sequences with varied degrees of divergence. This is because in a data set like this, the guide tree becomes less sensitive to noise. ClustalW was one of the first algorithms to combine pairwise alignment and global alignment in an attempt to be speed efficient, and it worked, but there is a loss in accuracy that other software doesn't have due to this.\n\nClustalW, when compared to other MSA algorithms, performed as one of the quickest while still maintaining a level of accuracy.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pais FS, Ruy PC, Oliveira G, Coimbra RS | title = Assessing the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment programs | journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24602402 | pmc = 4015676 | doi = 10.1186/1748-7188-9-4 }}</ref> There is still much to be improved compared to its consistency-based competitors like T-Coffee.

There have been updates and improvements to the algorithm that are present in ClustalW2 that work to increase accuracy while still maintaining its greatly valued speed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Clustal Omega ==\n\n=== Brief summary ===\n[[File:Clustal_Omega_Algorithm_Flowchart.svg|thumb|Flowchart depicting the step-by-step algorithm used in Clustal Omega.]]\n'''Clustal\u03a9''' (alternatively written as '''Clustal O''' and '''Clustal Omega''') is a fast and scalable program written in C and C++ used for [[multiple sequence alignment]]. It uses seeded guide trees and a new [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] engine that focuses on two profiles to generate these alignments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/|title=Clustal Omega < Multiple Sequence Alignment < EMBL-EBI|last=EMBL-EBI|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clustal.org/|title=Clustal Omega, ClustalW and ClustalX Multiple Sequence Alignment|last=Dineen|first=David|website=www.clustal.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate the [[multiple sequence alignment]], for two sequences use pairwise sequence alignment tools ([[EMBOSS]], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/lalign/ LALIGN]). Clustal Omega is consistency-based and is widely viewed as one of the fastest online implementations of all multiple sequence alignment tools and still ranks high in accuracy, among both consistency-based and matrix-based algorithms.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\n[[File:Profile_Hidden_Markov_Model.png|thumb|The structure of a profile HMM used in the implementation of Clustal Omega is shown here.]]\nClustal Omega has five main steps in order to generate the [[multiple sequence alignment]]. The first is producing a pairwise alignment using the k-tuple method, also known as the [[Sequence alignment#Word methods|word method]]. This, in summary, is a [[heuristic]] method that isn't guaranteed to find an optimal alignment solution, but is significantly more efficient than the dynamic programming method of alignment. After that, the sequences are clustered using the modified mBed method.<ref name=\":0\" /> The mBed method calculates pairwise distance using sequence embedding. This step is followed by the [[K-means clustering|k-means clustering method]]. Next, the guide tree is constructed using the [[UPGMA|UPGMA method]]. This is shown as multiple guide tree steps leading into one final guide tree construction because of the way the UPGMA algorithm works. At each step, (each diamond in the flowchart) the nearest two clusters are combined and is repeated until the final tree can be assessed. In the final step, the [[multiple sequence alignment]] is produced using HHAlign package from the [[HH-suite|HH-Suite]], which uses two profile [[Hidden Markov model|HMM's]]. A profile HMM is a linear state machine consisting of a series of nodes, each of which corresponds roughly to a position (column) in the alignment from which it was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/hmmanalysis.html|title=Profile HMM Analysis|website=www.biology.wustl.edu|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Time complexity ===\nThe exact way of computing an optimal alignment between ''N'' sequences has a computational complexity of <math>O(L^N)</math> for ''N'' sequences of length ''L'' making it prohibitive for even small numbers of sequences.

The speed and accuracy of the guide trees in Clustal Omega is attributed to the implementation of a modified mBed algorithm. It also reduces the computational time and memory requirements to complete alignments on large datasets.\n\n=== Accuracy and results ===\nThe accuracy of Clustal Omega on a small number of sequences is, on average, very similar to what are considered high quality sequence aligners. The difference comes when using large sets of data with hundreds of thousands of sequences. In these cases, Clustal Omega outperforms other algorithms across the board.

This improves the quality of the sensitivity and alignment significantly.<ref name=\":1\" /> This, combined with the mBed method, gives Clustal Omega its advantage over other sequence aligners. The results end up being very accurate and very quick which is the optimal situation.\n\nOn data sets with nonconserved terminal bases, Clustal Omega may be more accurate than [[ProbCons|Probcons]] and [[T-Coffee]] despite the fact that both of these are consistency-based algorithms, in contrast to Clustal Omega. On an efficiency test with programs that produce high accuracy scores, MAFFT was the fastest, closely followed by Clustal Omega.

This method works by analyzing the sequences as a whole, then utilizing the UPGMA/Neighbor-joining method to generate a distance matrix. A guide tree is then calculated from the scores of the sequences in the matrix, then subsequently used to build the multiple sequence alignment by progressively aligning the sequences in order of similarity.<ref name=\"CLUSTAL W Algorithm\">{{Cite web | url=https://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/clustalw/clustalw.html | title=CLUSTAL W Algorithm}}</ref> Essentially, Clustal creates multiple sequence alignments through three main steps:\n#Do a [[Sequence alignment|pairwise alignment]] using the progressive alignment method\n#Create a [[Molecular phylogenetics|guide tree]] (or use a user-defined tree)\n#Use the guide tree to carry out a multiple alignment\n\nThese steps are carried out automatically when you select \"Do Complete Alignment\".\nOther options are \"Do Alignment from guide tree and phylogeny\" and \"Produce guide tree only\".\n\n=== Input/Output ===\nThis program accepts a wide range of input formats, including NBRF/PIR, [[FASTA format|FASTA]], EMBL/[[UniProt|Swiss-Prot]], Clustal, GCC/MSF, GCG9 RSF, and GDE.\n\nThe output format can be one or many of the following: Clustal, NBRF/PIR, [[GCG (software)|GCG]]/MSF, [[PHYLIP]], GDE, or NEXUS.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nReading Multiple Sequence Alignment Output\n!Symbol\n!Definition\n!Meaning\n|-\n|*\n|asterisk\n|positions that have a single and fully conserved residue\n|-\n|:\n|colon\n|conservation between groups of strongly similar properties\nwith a score greater than .5 on the PAM 250 matrix\n|-\n|.\n|period\n|conservation between groups of weakly similar properties\nwith a score less than or equal to .5 on the PAM 250 matrix\n|}\nThe same symbols are shown for both DNA/RNA alignments and protein alignments, so while * (asterisk) symbols are useful to both, the other consensus symbols should be ignored for DNA/RNA alignments.\n\n=== Settings ===\nMany settings can be modified to adapt the alignment algorithm to different circumstances. The main parameters are the gap opening penalty, and the gap extension penalty.\n\n== Clustal and ClustalV ==\n=== Brief summary ===\nThe original program in the Clustal series of software was developed in 1988 as a way to generate multiple sequence alignments on personal computers. ClustalV was released 4 years later and greatly improved upon the original, adding and altering a few key features, including a switch to being written in C instead of Fortran like its predecessor.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nBoth versions use the same fast approximate algorithm to calculate the similarity scores between sequences, which in turn produces the pairwise alignments. The.  algorithm works by calculating the similarity scores as the number of k-tuple matches between two sequences, accounting for a set penalty for gaps. The more similar the sequences, the higher the score, the more divergent, the lower the scores. Once the sequences are scored, a [[dendrogram]] is generated through the UPGMA to represent the ordering of the multiple sequence alignment. The higher ordered sets of sequences are aligned first, followed by the rest in descending order. The algorithm allows for very large data sets, and works fast. However, the speed is dependent on the range for the k-tuple matches chosen for the particular sequence type.<ref name=\"aua.gr\">https://www.aua.gr/~eliop/mathimata/molevol/Askhsh1/clustalv.htm</ref>\n\n=== Notable ClustalV improvements ===\n\nSome of the most notable additions in ClustalV are profile alignments, and full command line interface options. The ability to use profile alignments allows the user to align two or more previous alignments or sequences to a new alignment and move misaligned sequences (low scored) further down the alignment order. This gives the user the option to gradually and methodically create multiple sequence alignments with more control than the basic option.<ref name=\"CLUSTAL W Algorithm\"/> The option to run from the command line greatly expedites the multiple sequence alignment process. Sequences can be run with a simple command,\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\"> clustalv nameoffile.seq </syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\"> clustalv /infile=nameoffile.seq </syntaxhighlight>\n\nand the program will determine what type of sequence it is analyzing. When the program is completed, the output of the multiple sequence alignment as well as the dendrogram go to files with .aln and .dnd extensions respectively. The command line interface uses the default parameters, and doesn't allow for other options.<ref name=\"aua.gr\"/>\n\n== ClustalW ==\n\n=== Brief summary ===\n[[File:Flowchart_for_ClustalW_Algorithm.svg|thumb|Depicts the steps the ClustalW software algorithm uses for global alignments]]\nClustalW like the other Clustal tools is used for aligning multiple nucleotide or protein sequences in an efficient manner. It uses progressive alignment methods, which align the most similar sequences first and work their way down to the least similar sequences until a global alignment is created. ClustalW is a matrix-based algorithm, whereas tools like [[T-Coffee]] and [[DIALIGN-T|Dialign]] are consistency-based. ClustalW has a fairly efficient algorithm that competes well against other software. This program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate a global alignment, for pairwise sequence alignment (2 sequences) use tools similar to [[EMBOSS]], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/lalign/ LALIGN].\n[[File:Neighbor_Joining_Phylogenetic_Tree.png|thumb|Diagram showing neighbor-joining method in sequence alignment for bioinformatics]]\n\n=== Algorithm ===\nClustalW uses progressive alignment methods as stated above. In these, the sequences with the best alignment score are aligned first, then progressively more distant groups of sequences are aligned. This heuristic approach is necessary due to the time and memory demand of finding the global optimal solution. The first step to the algorithm is computing a rough distance matrix between each pair of sequences, also known as [[Sequence alignment#Pairwise alignment|pairwise sequence alignment]]. The next step is a [[Neighbor joining|neighbor-joining method]] that uses midpoint rooting to create an overall guide tree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.megasoftware.net/web_help_7/hc_clustalw.htm|title=About CLUSTALW|website=www.megasoftware.net|access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref> The process it uses to do this is shown in the detailed diagram for the method to the right. The guide tree is then used as a rough template to generate a global alignment.\n\n=== Time complexity ===\nClustalW has a time complexity of <math>O(N^2)</math> because of its use of the neighbor-joining method. In the updated version (ClustalW2) there is an option built into the software to use [[UPGMA]] which is faster with large input sizes. The command line flag in order to use it instead of neighbor-joining is:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\">\n-clustering=UPGMA\n</syntaxhighlight>For example, on a standard desktop, running UPGMA on 10,000 sequences would produce results in less than a minute while neighbor-joining would take over an hour.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Larkin|first=M.A.|last2=Blackshields|first2=G.|last3=Brown|first3=N.P.|last4=Chenna|first4=R.|last5=McGettigan|first5=P.A.|last6=McWilliam|first6=H.|last7=Valentin|first7=F.|last8=Wallace|first8=I.M.|last9=Wilm|first9=A.|date=2007-09-10|title=Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0|journal=Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=23|issue=21|pages=2947\u20132948|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm404|pmid=17846036|issn=1367-4803}}</ref> By running the ClustalW algorithm with this adjustment, it saves significant amounts of time.\n\nClustalW2 also has an option to use iterative alignment to increase alignment accuracy. While it is not necessarily faster or more efficient complexity-wise, the increase in accuracy is valuable and can be useful for smaller data sizes. These are the various command line flags to achieve this:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c++\">\n-Iteration=Alignment\n-Iteration=Tree\n-numiters\n\n</syntaxhighlight>The first command line option refines the final alignment. The second option incorporates the scheme into the progressive alignment step of the algorithm. The third specifies the number of iteration cycles where the default value is set to 3.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Accuracy and Results ===\nThe algorithm ClustalW uses provides a close-to-optimal result almost every time. However, it does exceptionally well when the data set contains sequences with varied degrees of divergence. This is because in a data set like this, the guide tree becomes less sensitive to noise. ClustalW was one of the first algorithms to combine pairwise alignment and global alignment in an attempt to be speed efficient, and it worked, but there is a loss in accuracy that other software doesn't have due to this.\n\nClustalW, when compared to other MSA algorithms, performed as one of the quickest while still maintaining a level of accuracy.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pais FS, Ruy PC, Oliveira G, Coimbra RS | title = Assessing the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment programs | journal = Algorithms for Molecular Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24602402 | pmc = 4015676 | doi = 10.1186/1748-7188-9-4 }}</ref> There is still much to be improved compared to its consistency-based competitors like T-Coffee.

There have been updates and improvements to the algorithm that are present in ClustalW2 that work to increase accuracy while still maintaining its greatly valued speed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Clustal Omega ==\n\n=== Brief summary ===\n[[File:Clustal_Omega_Algorithm_Flowchart.svg|thumb|Flowchart depicting the step-by-step algorithm used in Clustal Omega.]]\n'''Clustal\u03a9''' (alternatively written as '''Clustal O''' and '''Clustal Omega''') is a fast and scalable program written in C and C++ used for [[multiple sequence alignment]]. It uses seeded guide trees and a new [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]] engine that focuses on two profiles to generate these alignments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/|title=Clustal Omega < Multiple Sequence Alignment < EMBL-EBI|last=EMBL-EBI|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clustal.org/|title=Clustal Omega, ClustalW and ClustalX Multiple Sequence Alignment|last=Dineen|first=David|website=www.clustal.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}</ref> The program requires three or more sequences in order to calculate the [[multiple sequence alignment]], for two sequences use pairwise sequence alignment tools ([[EMBOSS]], [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/lalign/ LALIGN]). Clustal Omega is consistency-based and is widely viewed as one of the fastest online implementations of all multiple sequence alignment tools and still ranks high in accuracy, among both consistency-based and matrix-based algorithms.\n\n=== Algorithm ===\n[[File:Profile_Hidden_Markov_Model.png|thumb|The structure of a profile HMM used in the implementation of Clustal Omega is shown here.]]\nClustal Omega has five main steps in order to generate the [[multiple sequence alignment]]. The first is producing a pairwise alignment using the k-tuple method, also known as the [[Sequence alignment#Word methods|word method]]. This, in summary, is a [[heuristic]] method that isn't guaranteed to find an optimal alignment solution, but is significantly more efficient than the dynamic programming method of alignment. After that, the sequences are clustered using the modified mBed method.<ref name=\":0\" /> The mBed method calculates pairwise distance using sequence embedding. This step is followed by the [[K-means clustering|k-means clustering method]]. Next, the guide tree is constructed using the [[UPGMA|UPGMA method]]. This is shown as multiple guide tree steps leading into one final guide tree construction because of the way the UPGMA algorithm works. At each step, (each diamond in the flowchart) the nearest two clusters are combined and is repeated until the final tree can be assessed. In the final step, the [[multiple sequence alignment]] is produced using HHAlign package from the [[HH-suite|HH-Suite]], which uses two profile [[Hidden Markov model|HMM's]]. A profile HMM is a linear state machine consisting of a series of nodes, each of which corresponds roughly to a position (column) in the alignment from which it was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biology.wustl.edu/gcg/hmmanalysis.html|title=Profile HMM Analysis|website=www.biology.wustl.edu|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Time complexity ===\nThe exact way of computing an optimal alignment between ''N'' sequences has a computational complexity of <math>O(L^N)</math> for ''N'' sequences of length ''L'' making it prohibitive for even small numbers of sequences.

The speed and accuracy of the guide trees in Clustal Omega is attributed to the implementation of a modified mBed algorithm. It also reduces the computational time and memory requirements to complete alignments on large datasets.\n\n=== Accuracy and results ===\nThe accuracy of Clustal Omega on a small number of sequences is, on average, very similar to what are considered high quality sequence aligners. The difference comes when using large sets of data with hundreds of thousands of sequences. In these cases, Clustal Omega outperforms other algorithms across the board. Its completion time and overall quality is consistently better than other programs.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Daugelaite|first=Jurate|last2=O' Driscoll|first2=Aisling|last3=Sleator|first3=Roy D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013|title=An Overview of Multiple Sequence Alignments and Cloud Computing in Bioinformatics|journal=ISRN Biomathematics|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1155/2013/615630|issn=2090-7702}}</ref> It is capable of running 100,000+ sequences on one processor in a few hours.\n\nClustal Omega uses the HHAlign package of the [[HH-suite|HH-Suite]], which aligns two profile [[Hidden Markov model|Hidden Markov Models]] instead of a profile-profile comparison. This improves the quality of the sensitivity and alignment significantly.<ref name=\":1\" /> This, combined with the mBed method, gives Clustal Omega its advantage over other sequence aligners. The results end up being very accurate and very quick which is the optimal situation.\n\nOn data sets with nonconserved terminal bases, Clustal Omega may be more accurate than [[ProbCons|Probcons]] and [[T-Coffee]] despite the fact that both of these are consistency-based algorithms, in contrast to Clustal Omega. On an efficiency test with programs that produce high accuracy scores, MAFFT was the fastest, closely followed by Clustal Omega.
