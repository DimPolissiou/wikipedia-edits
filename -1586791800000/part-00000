He was the 2016 [[Europe's Strongest Man]] champion.\n\n==Early life==\nShahlaei was born in [[Cheltenham|Cheltenham, Gloucestershire]],<ref name=\"Gl\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/sport/news/Shahlaei-England-s-strongest/article-1153427-detail/article.html |title=''Shahlaei is England's strongest'' in www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk |access-date=18 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716034031/http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/sport/news/Shahlaei-England-s-strongest/article-1153427-detail/article.html |archive-date=16 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the son of an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] father from [[Kermanshah]] and an [[English people|English]] mother from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He attended [[Balcarras School]], and later moved to [[Stroud|Stroud, Gloucestershire]].<ref name=\"Gl\"/>\n\n==Strongman career==\nShahlaei started strongman training in 2005 and entered his first novice competition that year, where he finished 8th. Within two years, he entered his first [[Britain's Strongest Man]] (\"BSM\"), having won the Midlands qualifier. In that competition, he made a huge impact, making it to the final, only to tear his biceps in the tyre flip, which forced him to withdraw. He won the Midlands qualifier again in 2008, and once again made the final, this time finishing 4th behind [[Jimmy Marku]], [[Terry Hollands]], and [[Mark Felix]]. This placing landed him an invite to the [[World's Strongest Man]] in 2008. Despite his impressive win in the squat, he did not make the final.\n\nIn 2009, just four years after beginning strongman, he became the [[UK Strength Council|UKSC]] Midlands Strongest Man and also won the UKSC [[England's Strongest Man]], citing this, alongside his WSM 2008 squat win, as the greatest moment of his career (the WSM qualifier titled \"England's Strongest Man\", which replaced the Britain's Strongest Man contest in 2009, was won by [[Terry Hollands]] and Shahlaei did not compete in that). His favourite strongman event is the farmer's walk because it is a good test of natural strength, whereas his least favourite strongman event is the Atlas stones. Shahlaei has said that he admires [[Bill Kazmaier]] and [[Vasyl Virastyuk]] for their intensity and belief in themselves, qualities he seeks to emulate, and that he believes the greatest strength athlete of all time is [[Zydrunas Savickas]].\n\nLaurence competed in World's Ultimate Strongman in Dubai at the Bab al-Shams Arena in October 2018. It is said that the prize money was 'more than ever before'. He competed against other top Strongmen such as Brian Shaw, Thor, Terry Hollands, Martins Liscis etc. Going in to the competition, Laurence was still recovering from a few minor injuries, and said he was going to do himself proud and not focus on the other athletes. After 5 gruelling events including a truck pull, silver dollar deadlift and overhead pressing medley, Laurence finished 5th, ahead of many other top athletes, proving he is still among the World's elite.\n\nLaurence Shahlaei's next competition is Britain's Strongest Man which will take place at the Fly DSA Arena in Sheffield in January 2019. With Eddie Hall having withdrawn from competing in Strongman after dominating the British scene for the last few years to go in to acting and presenting, Laurence has said publicly that he is aiming to claim back his title of the strongest man in Britain, but standing in his way will be other top British Athletes, including [[Terry Hollands]] , [[Adam Bishop]] , and [[Graham Hicks]] . Laurence reiterd from strongman in 2019 during the worlds strongest man 2019 laurence made it clear it was his last appearance Laurence ruptured his Achilles in the second event the yoke walk\n\n==Other work==\nShahlaei has said that he would like to set up a sports related business in the future, but his dream is to become an actor. He had a role in [[The Golden Compass (film)|''The Golden Compass'']] (2007).\n\nOn 19 August 2011, Shahlaei competed on ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', where he won \u00a320,000 and lifted presenter [[Noel Edmonds]] up above his head.\n\nIn August 2012, Shahlaei opened a [[personal training]] business in [[Swindon, Wiltshire]].<ref>[http://www.laurenceshahlaei.co.uk laurenceshahlaei.co.uk]</ref>.

V. Krishna Reddy]], starring [[J. D. Chakravarthy]] and [[Soundarya]] in lead roles. Upon release the film and soundtrack received positive reviews, and became a super-hit.\n\n==Plot==\nVenkata Narayana ([[Prakash Raj]]) is one of the biggest business tycoons in India having a personal net worth of Rs 2,500 crores. His motto of life is \"Dare to dream and care to achieve\". His only daughter is Madhavi ([[Soundarya]]). She is arriving from the US after doing her MBA. He wanted to make her the MD for his companies. But Madhavi tells him that she wants to join as a clerk in his firm and learn the tricks of trade and slowly take over Venkata Narayana's post when she is ready. Venkata Narayana likes her idea and he appoints her as a clerk in his office and she changes her name to Malati.\n\nManohar ([[J. D. Chakravarthy]]) just finished his B.Com. Manohar comes to know that Venkata Narayana is none but his own maternal uncle. Then he chooses the easy way out to become a millionaire. That is to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayara, Madhavi.\n\nOn his way to [[Hyderabad]], Manohar skillfully rescues a pregnant woman, who happened to be the friend of Madhavi. As expected, Manohar nonchalantly leaves the train without making any advances to Madhavi, though she attracted him with her charms.\n\nManohar joins his uncle's office as a dispatch clerk. Manohar gets surprised by knowing that the beautiful girl he met on the train is working at the same office. He meets his college-time bum chum Ravi ([[Ravi Teja]]) as the canteen owner for the same office. He puts up with Ravi. Obviously, Malati is staying on the ground floor of the same building in which these guys are staying.\n\nWhen Manohar and Ravi overhear the telephone conversation between Malati and her father, they come to know that Malati is none other than Madhavi. Then the inevitable thing happens and Manohar falls in love with Madhavi. Madhavi confesses to Venkata Narayana that she is in love with Manohar. Then Venkata Narayana tells her that Manohar is her brother-in-law and Manohar is more interested in her money than herself. Madhavi refuses to accept the allegation by her father and she tells him that she will prove that Manohar is not after money.\n\nShe performs a drama to lead Manohar and Ravi into believing that she is Malati, a poor fisherman's daughter. Manohar fails to acknowledge his love for her after he realizes that she is a daughter of a poor man. He confesses to Malati that he is here to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayana, but not Malati. He expresses his love and obsession for money.\n\nMadhavi has two choices now. One is to go back to her father and accept her defeat. The second is to change Manohar. She decides to do both. She meets Venkata Narayana and tells him that Manohar is a money-minded man. She asks him to give her a chance to change Manohar. They fix 31 December 1999 as the deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, Manohar loses his job in Venkata Narayana's company. Inspired by a spirited speech by Malati, he decides to do his own consultancy by giving solutions (ideas) to the CEOs who are facing labour and marketing problems. But he is still interested in money and the charm of Madhavi, whom he thinks he did not find. Manohar in turn upsets the apple cart of Venkata Narayana by making the strategic marketing deals with Venkata Narayana's business rival Rama ([[Ranganath (actor)|Ranganath]]). Now, Venkata Narayana decides to get even with Manohar and promises him that he will give his daughter to Manohar and the grand announcement of this news would be done at the New Year's Eve bash.\n\n[[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] is the younger brother of Venkata Narayana's wife (Y.

V. Krishna Reddy]], starring [[J. D. Chakravarthy]] and [[Soundarya]] in lead roles. Upon release the film and soundtrack received positive reviews, and became a super-hit.\n\n==Plot==\nVenkata Narayana ([[Prakash Raj]]) is one of the biggest business tycoons in India having a personal net worth of Rs 2,500 crores. His motto of life is \"Dare to dream and care to achieve\". His only daughter is Madhavi ([[Soundarya]]). She is arriving from the US after doing her MBA. He wanted to make her the MD for his companies. But Madhavi tells him that she wants to join as a clerk in his firm and learn the tricks of trade and slowly take over Venkata Narayana's post when she is ready. Venkata Narayana likes her idea and he appoints her as a clerk in his office and she changes her name to Malati.\n\nManohar ([[J. D. Chakravarthy]]) just finished his B.Com. Manohar comes to know that Venkata Narayana is none but his own maternal uncle. Then he chooses the easy way out to become a millionaire. That is to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayara, Madhavi.\n\nOn his way to [[Hyderabad]], Manohar skillfully rescues a pregnant woman, who happened to be the friend of Madhavi. As expected, Manohar nonchalantly leaves the train without making any advances to Madhavi, though she attracted him with her charms.\n\nManohar joins his uncle's office as a dispatch clerk. Manohar gets surprised by knowing that the beautiful girl he met on the train is working at the same office. He meets his college-time bum chum Ravi ([[Ravi Teja]]) as the canteen owner for the same office. He puts up with Ravi. Obviously, Malati is staying on the ground floor of the same building in which these guys are staying.\n\nWhen Manohar and Ravi overhear the telephone conversation between Malati and her father, they come to know that Malati is none other than Madhavi. Then the inevitable thing happens and Manohar falls in love with Madhavi. Madhavi confesses to Venkata Narayana that she is in love with Manohar. Then Venkata Narayana tells her that Manohar is her brother-in-law and Manohar is more interested in her money than herself. Madhavi refuses to accept the allegation by her father and she tells him that she will prove that Manohar is not after money.\n\nShe performs a drama to lead Manohar and Ravi into believing that she is Malati, a poor fisherman's daughter. Manohar fails to acknowledge his love for her after he realizes that she is a daughter of a poor man. He confesses to Malati that he is here to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayana, but not Malati. He expresses his love and obsession for money.\n\nMadhavi has two choices now. One is to go back to her father and accept her defeat. The second is to change Manohar. She decides to do both. She meets Venkata Narayana and tells him that Manohar is a money-minded man. She asks him to give her a chance to change Manohar. They fix 31 December 1999 as the deadline.\n\nMeanwhile, Manohar loses his job in Venkata Narayana's company. Inspired by a spirited speech by Malati, he decides to do his own consultancy by giving solutions (ideas) to the CEOs who are facing labour and marketing problems. But he is still interested in money and the charm of Madhavi, whom he thinks he did not find. Manohar in turn upsets the apple cart of Venkata Narayana by making the strategic marketing deals with Venkata Narayana's business rival Rama ([[Ranganath (actor)|Ranganath]]). Now, Venkata Narayana decides to get even with Manohar and promises him that he will give his daughter to Manohar and the grand announcement of this news would be done at the New Year's Eve bash.\n\n[[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] is the younger brother of Venkata Narayana's wife (Y. Vijaya). Surya is willing to marry Madhavi. This film-crazy and director aspirant Surya follows Venkata Narayana and weaves a hypothetical story around the incidents and concludes that Manohar is the villain of the entire episode.\n\nIt's 31 December 1999. Midnight is fast approaching. As he is the hero, Surya kidnaps Manohar and keeps him in his dungeon and goes to attend the midnight bash thrown by Venkata Narayana. Manohar attends the bash by bashing the guys who kidnapped him.  Venkata Narayana announces that he will marry off his daughter, Madhavi to Manohar. But, Manohar says that he will marry Malati not knowing that she is Madhavi. Venkata Narayana announces Malati is Madhavi.

Further evidence for this conclusion: Howard University in Washington, a university in which over 99 per cent of undergraduates are black, admits overseas applicants from the West Indies with five GCE O-level grades at A-C to the freshman year of their bachelor's degree programme; Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious of the private universities, states in its prospectus that advanced placement is available for students entering with either International Baccalaur\u00e9at or GCE A-level. The rider must be added, however, that an American education is very much more general than a UK education right up to bachelor's level; it would hardly be reasonable, therefore, to expect the same standard to be reached in the major subject. It was also noted that, in the highest quality institutions, some individual modules taken by senior students compared well in level with UK final honours standard.

Further evidence for this conclusion: Howard University in Washington, a university in which over 99 per cent of undergraduates are black, admits overseas applicants from the West Indies with five GCE O-level grades at A-C to the freshman year of their bachelor's degree programme; Johns Hopkins, one of the most prestigious of the private universities, states in its prospectus that advanced placement is available for students entering with either International Baccalaur\u00e9at or GCE A-level. The rider must be added, however, that an American education is very much more general than a UK education right up to bachelor's level; it would hardly be reasonable, therefore, to expect the same standard to be reached in the major subject. It was also noted that, in the highest quality institutions, some individual modules taken by senior students compared well in level with UK final honours standard.
