It lies some 30&nbsp;km northeast of [[Arnhem]], on the eastern bank of the river [[IJssel]] at the point where it is joined by the [[Berkel]].  First mentioned in the 11th century, the place-name appears to mean \"south [[fen]]\" ({{lang|nl|zuid-veen}} in modern Dutch). In 2005, the municipality of Zutphen was merged with the municipality of [[Warnsveld]], retaining its name. In {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}, the municipality had a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Zutphen}}}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nederland Gelderland Zutphen Snaphaan.jpg|left|thumb|\"Snaphaanschelling\" struck in Zutphen]]\n[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9166.tif|left|thumb|Zutphen taken by [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]] on 16 October 1572 during the [[Eighty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:Zutphen 1649 Blaeu.jpg|thumb|left|1649 map of Zutphen in [[Willem Blaeu|Willem]] and [[Joan Blaeu]]'s \"Toonneel der Steden\"]]\n[[File:Zutphen 1654.jpg|thumb|left|Zutphen (1654)]]\nIn about 300 AD, a Germanic settlement was the first permanent town on a complex of low river [[dune]]s. Whereas many such settlements were abandoned in the early [[Middle Ages]], Zutphen on its strategic confluence of [[IJssel]] and [[Berkel]] stayed. After the incorporation of the IJssel lands in [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Francia]], Zutphen became a local centre of governance under a [[count of Zutphen|count]]. The [[Normans]] raided and ravaged it in 882. Afterwards a [[circular fortress]] was built to protect the budding town against Viking attacks.\n\nIn the eleventh century, Zutphen was a royal residence for a number of years; a [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] was built, together with a large [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] church, the predecessor of the present St. Walburgis. The counts of Zutphen acquired a lot of power, until the [[count of Zutphen|line of counts]] became extinct in the twelfth century. After the death of her father and her brother, [[Ermengarde of Zutphen|Ermengarde]], the heiress of Zutphen married the count of [[Guelders]]; her son [[Henry I, Count of Guelders]] was the first to wear both titles.\n\nThe settlement received town rights between 1191 and 1196, making it one of the oldest towns in the country. This allowed it to self govern and have a judicial court. Only [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and [[Deventer]] preceded it in receiving town rights. Zutphen, in turn, became the mother town of several other towns in Guelders, such as [[Arnhem]], [[Doetinchem]], [[Doesburg]], [[Lochem]], [[Harderwijk]], [[Venlo]] and [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]. It also became part of the [[Hanseatic League]], a group of towns with great wealth; this league was the economic centre in that part of Europe.\n\nDuring the 12th century, coins were minted in Zutphen by the Counts of Guelders and Zutphen: [[Henry I, Count of Guelders|Henry I]] ({{circa|1150}}\u20131181) and [[Otto I, Count of Guelders|Otto I]] (1182\u20131207). Although the city had [[Mint (coin)|minting]] rights for a few centuries this was only actively used during four periods: 1478\u20131480, 1582\u20131583, 1604\u20131605 and 1687\u20131692.\n\nThe largest and oldest church of the city is the St. Walburgis ([[Saint Walpurga]]) church, which originally dates from the eleventh century. The present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building contains monuments of the former counts of Zutphen, a fourteenth-century [[candelabrum]], an elaborate copper [[baptismal font|font]] (1527), and a monument to the Van Heeckeren family (1700). The [[chapter-house]]'s library ({{interlanguage link|Librije (Zutphen)|lt=Librije|nl}}) contains a pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] collection, including some valuable [[manuscript]]s and [[incunabulum|incunabula]]. It is considered one of only five remaining medieval libraries in Europe (the others being in England and Italy). This [[chained library]]'s books are still chained to their ancient wooden desk \u2013 a custom from centuries ago, when the \"public library\" used chains to prevent theft.\n\nHaving been fortified the town withstood several sieges, specially during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the most celebrated fight under its walls being the [[Battle of Zutphen]] in September 1586 when [[Sir Philip Sidney]] was mortally wounded. Taken by the Spanish in 1587 by the treachery of the English commander [[Rowland York]], Zutphen was [[Siege of Zutphen (1591)|recovered]] by [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice, prince of Orange]], in 1591, and except for two short periods, one in 1672 and the other during the French Revolutionary Wars, it has since then remained a part of the Netherlands. Its fortifications were dismantled in 1874. In [[World War II]] the town was bombed several times by the allied forces because the bridge over the IJssel was vital to support the German troops at Arnhem after the [[Operation Market Garden]]. After two weeks of battle the town was liberated on 14 April 1945. After the war a renovation program started. Nowadays Zutphen has one of the best preserved medieval town centres of northwestern Europe, including the remains of the medieval town wall and a few hundred buildings dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n==Modern city==\n[[File:Zutphen-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of the city of Zutphen, 2014]]\n[[File:20140421 IJsselkade en Walburgkerk Zutphen.jpg|thumb|The IJssel river in Zutphen]]\n[[File:29 March 2014, almost 20 degrees^ Real springtime at Zutphen innercity - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Zutphen's old city centre]]\nThe old center survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] almost in its entirety, though some parts of the city were lost, especially the area around the railway station, in the northern part of the city center, known as the {{lang|nl|Nieuwstad}} (English: New City). The city center includes many monumental buildings dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, and some even date back to the 13th century, such as a retirement home area. There are also remains of the old town walls in several places.\n\nToday, Zutphen is a modern small city. The urban area, which includes the village of Warnsveld, has about 51,000 inhabitants. Food shops are open from 8:30 am and other stores are open from 9:30 am to 6 pm on weekdays, on Friday evening until 9 pm and on Saturday until 5 pm. Some stores open earlier, and the larger supermarkets usually stay open until 10 pm.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Interesting buildings and squares ===\nBecause Zutphen contains a large number of historical buildings with a tower, Zutphen is often called the tower city. Because there are almost no modern high-rise buildings in the city centre the historical tower spires are very visible and form the skyline of Zutphen. The title of tower city is often used in advertising to draw tourists to Zutphen.\n\n==== Religious architecture ====\nThe Walburgis church was built as a Roman collegiate church around 1050, after that it was redecorated, rebuild and remodeled on several occasions. There are six bells in the tower, which are still rung by hand. \n\nSince 1561 a library called the Librije was added to the church. It was founded as a public library for the rich citizens of Zutphen. These days the library contains an important collection of 15th- to 17th-century books.\n\nThe Broederen (brothers) church is a large early 14th-century monastery church of the Dominican order. Since 1983 the church has been used as the city's public library, and it was recently been extensively restored. On top of the church there is a roof turret from 1771 that contains the porter's bell. This bell is still rung every day between 9:50 and 10:00 pm,  the time at which, until 1853, the city gates would be closed.\n\nThe Nieuwstads (new city) church houses the Catholic community. It was founded as a parish church around 1250. Since then it has been expanded, remodelled and restored many times. It has four original medieval bells.\n\n==== Civic architecture ====\nThe Drogenaps tower was built between 1444 and 1446 as a city gate. In 1465 the entrance was bricked up after which it became known as a tower instead of a gate. City musician Tonis Drogenap lived there around 1555 and the tower's current name is derived from him. From 1888 till 1927 the tower was used as a water tower.\n\nThe Wijnhuis (Winery) Tower was built between 1618 and 1642 by the city master builder Emond Hellenraet, influenced by Hendrick de Keyser. In 1644 the brothers Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony made the world's first correctly tuned carillon for this tower. During the summer months carillon concerts are regularly held.\n\nThe Bourgonje tower is a defensive turret build in 1457. It was built during the Gelderland-Burgundian war. The Dutch theologian and philosopher Johannes Florentius Martinet wrote his ''Katechismus der Natuur'' (Catechism of Nature) in this tower.\n\nThe Berkel gate is part of the city wall on the east side of the medieval city. This gate over the river Berkel connected the old city and the new city. It was built in 1320. It also had a western counterpart but that gate was demolished in 1772.\n\n==== Other interesting sights in Zutphen ====\nThe city of Zutphen had almost 400 national monuments and over 500 local monuments. It is one of the most important and well-preserved historical city centres in the Netherlands. Zutphen has a great many medieval, especially 14th-century, houses. These houses, often with ornamental facades, can be spotted all through the city centre.\n\nWhen walking along the old city market you will see several large 18th- and 19th-century buildings that used to belong to well-to-do citizens and merchants.\n\n==Regional center==\n===Juridical centre===\nZutphen, although a relatively small town, houses one of the Netherlands' 13 [[court]]s, the national training institution for judges and public prosecutors (SSR), the national police academy for senior police investigators, three prisons and a large number of lawyers. It is the early emergence of Zutphen in the Middle Ages as the main town of a [[county]] that explains its current position in the juridical system.\n\nBesides a 'normal' prison, one may find in Zutphen the [[JPC de Sprengen]] penitentiary facility for boys. There are several buildings: new institutions replacing the old facilities, but the old prisons remained open after completion of the new facilities. Only the old prison called Lunette did not meet today's standards and has closed in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite paper\n  | author = Min. of Justice, Inspectie voor Sanctietoepassing\n  | title = Inspectierapport Doorlichting PI Achterhoek, lokatie Lunette\n  | year = 2007\n  | url = http://www.inspectiesanctietoepassing.nl/images/Inspectierapport%20PI%20Achterhoek%20locatie%20Lunette_tcm56-75983.pdf\n  | format = [[PDF]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Medical centre===\nLocated in Zutphen is the \"Spittaal\", location of the [[Gelre Hospitals|Gelre Ziekenhuizen]] (Gelre Hospitals) group. This is a regular hospital offering all common specialities (no cardio-thoracic or neurosurgery) and a 24/7 emergency department. It is located in the southeastern part of the town, in the district of Leesten. A sizable number of practitioners of alternative medicine are located in Zutphen.\n\n===Educational centre===\nZutphen is home to several well-known schools for secondary education on all levels. These include the \"Het Stedelijk\" (Dalton plan education and bilingual education), \"Baudartius College\", \"Vrije School Zutphen\", (a \"Vrije School\" being a [[Waldorf School]]) and \"Isendoorn College\" (with bilingual education,located in [[Warnsveld]]). Students from a wide area around Zutphen learn at these schools.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Zutphen haven 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Port of Zutphen]]\n=== Rail ===\n[[Zutphen railway station]] is an important regional railway centre. The main electrified lines, to [[Deventer]] and [[Zwolle]] in the north, and to [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]] in the south, are run by the national railway company [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] (NS). The secondary lines to [[Winterswijk]] and [[Apeldoorn]] are operated by [[Arriva]]. The secondary line to [[Hengelo]] is operated by [[Blauwnet]] (a division of [[Syntus]]). The regional rail service is run by a special subsidiary of the NS. All secondary lines run diesel trains. Zutphen's old station building (1863), upgraded in 1875, was partly destroyed during [[World War II]]. In the early 1950s a modern new station was built, a typical post-war building with concrete as its main material.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | last = Bramer  \n  | first = Wichor\n  | title = Station Zutphen\n  | work = Railwaystations in the Netherlands\n  | publisher = Stationsweb\n  | date = 2008-01-31\n  | url = http://www.stationsweb.com/zutphen\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}.\n</ref>\nHowever, in October 2007 the station building was designated as a State Monument. In 2006 and 2007, the area surrounding the railway station was completely renovated: a new bus terminal and an underground bicycle parking lot were constructed, and the main road leading from the railway station to the town centre was turned into a road for pedestrians and cyclists only.\n\n===Road===\nZutphen lies 10 kilometers south of the A1 motorway, which can be entered where it passes [[Deventer]]. From there the A1 leads East to [[Hengelo]] and West past [[Apeldoorn]] to [[Amsterdam]]. Main roads are the N348 (Arnhem to Zutphen, Deventer and Ommen), N314 (Zutphen to Doetinchem), N319 (Zutphen to Vorden and Winterswijk), N345 (Zutphen to Lochem and Hengelo), N826 (Zutphen to Almen and Laren).\n\n===Bus===\nAlmost all buses in and around Zutphen are operated by [[Arriva]]. There are three internal city bus lines, and regional lines to [[Doetinchem]], [[Deventer]], [[Almen]]-[[Laren, Gelderland|Laren]] and [[Vorden]]. The bus lines towards [[Apeldoorn]] and [[Dieren]] were cancelled in the past; these towns and the destinations in between can now only be reached by car or by train.\n\n==Sister cities==\n{{Main|List of twin towns and sister cities in The Netherlands}}\n\nZutphen is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Horstmar]], [[Germany]]\n* {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Satu Mare]], [[Romania]]\n||\n* {{flagicon|England}} [[Shrewsbury]], [[England]]  <ref> [https://www.shrewsburytowncouncil.gov.uk/shrewsbury-town-twinning-zutphen]  Shrewsbury Town Council\nWebsite; retrieved 18 December 2019 </ref>\n* {{flagicon|Nicaragua}} [[Villa Sandino]], [[Nicaragua]]\n|}\n\nDelegations including the mayors of the cities visit each other, and developmental aid programs are in place with Satu Mare, Tartu and Villa Sandino.\n\n==Notable residents==\n[[File:Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|140px|thumb|Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle, ca.1700]]\n[[File:Joopwesterweel.gif|140px|thumb|Joop Westerweel]]\n[[File:Jan brandts buys.jpg|140px|thumb|Jan Brandts Buys, 1893]]\n[[File:RoelvinkDuisburg.jpg|140px|thumb|Mirte Roelvink, 2011]]\n=== Public thinking & Public Service ===\n* [[Gerard Zerbolt of Zutphen]] (1367\u20131398) a mystical writer and early member of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]]\n* [[Johannes Mensing]] (1477\u20131547) a German Dominican theologian and controversialist, an opponent of [[Martin Luther]]\n* [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] (c.\u20091609\u20131667 and 1619\u20131680), bell founders, who built the world's first tuned carillon, installed in Zutphen's Wijnhuistoren tower in 1644\n* [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle]] (1670\u20131718) right-hand man of [[William III of Orange]] \n* [[Judith van Dorth]] (1747 in Warnsveld \u2013 1799) an [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|orangist]] and aristocrat, executed for treason\n* [[John Andrew Stedman]] (1778\u20131833) a general in the Dutch army during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] <ref> [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Stedman,_John_Andrew_(DNB00)   Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 54, Stedman, John Andrew] retrieved 19 December 2019 </ref>   \n* [[Jacob van Heeckeren tot Enghuizen]] (1792\u20131884) a Dutch diplomat\n* [[Herman Hendrik Baanders]] (1849\u20131905) architect who was primarily active in Amsterdam\n* [[Richard Constant Boer]] (1863 in Warnsveld -

It lies some 30&nbsp;km northeast of [[Arnhem]], on the eastern bank of the river [[IJssel]] at the point where it is joined by the [[Berkel]].  First mentioned in the 11th century, the place-name appears to mean \"south [[fen]]\" ({{lang|nl|zuid-veen}} in modern Dutch). In 2005, the municipality of Zutphen was merged with the municipality of [[Warnsveld]], retaining its name. In {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}, the municipality had a population of {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Zutphen}}}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nederland Gelderland Zutphen Snaphaan.jpg|left|thumb|\"Snaphaanschelling\" struck in Zutphen]]\n[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9166.tif|left|thumb|Zutphen taken by [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]] on 16 October 1572 during the [[Eighty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:Zutphen 1649 Blaeu.jpg|thumb|left|1649 map of Zutphen in [[Willem Blaeu|Willem]] and [[Joan Blaeu]]'s \"Toonneel der Steden\"]]\n[[File:Zutphen 1654.jpg|thumb|left|Zutphen (1654)]]\nIn about 300 AD, a Germanic settlement was the first permanent town on a complex of low river [[dune]]s. Whereas many such settlements were abandoned in the early [[Middle Ages]], Zutphen on its strategic confluence of [[IJssel]] and [[Berkel]] stayed. After the incorporation of the IJssel lands in [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Francia]], Zutphen became a local centre of governance under a [[count of Zutphen|count]]. The [[Normans]] raided and ravaged it in 882. Afterwards a [[circular fortress]] was built to protect the budding town against Viking attacks.\n\nIn the eleventh century, Zutphen was a royal residence for a number of years; a [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] was built, together with a large [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] church, the predecessor of the present St. Walburgis. The counts of Zutphen acquired a lot of power, until the [[count of Zutphen|line of counts]] became extinct in the twelfth century. After the death of her father and her brother, [[Ermengarde of Zutphen|Ermengarde]], the heiress of Zutphen married the count of [[Guelders]]; her son [[Henry I, Count of Guelders]] was the first to wear both titles.\n\nThe settlement received town rights between 1191 and 1196, making it one of the oldest towns in the country. This allowed it to self govern and have a judicial court. Only [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and [[Deventer]] preceded it in receiving town rights. Zutphen, in turn, became the mother town of several other towns in Guelders, such as [[Arnhem]], [[Doetinchem]], [[Doesburg]], [[Lochem]], [[Harderwijk]], [[Venlo]] and [[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]. It also became part of the [[Hanseatic League]], a group of towns with great wealth; this league was the economic centre in that part of Europe.\n\nDuring the 12th century, coins were minted in Zutphen by the Counts of Guelders and Zutphen: [[Henry I, Count of Guelders|Henry I]] ({{circa|1150}}\u20131181) and [[Otto I, Count of Guelders|Otto I]] (1182\u20131207). Although the city had [[Mint (coin)|minting]] rights for a few centuries this was only actively used during four periods: 1478\u20131480, 1582\u20131583, 1604\u20131605 and 1687\u20131692.\n\nThe largest and oldest church of the city is the St. Walburgis ([[Saint Walpurga]]) church, which originally dates from the eleventh century. The present [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building contains monuments of the former counts of Zutphen, a fourteenth-century [[candelabrum]], an elaborate copper [[baptismal font|font]] (1527), and a monument to the Van Heeckeren family (1700). The [[chapter-house]]'s library ({{interlanguage link|Librije (Zutphen)|lt=Librije|nl}}) contains a pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] collection, including some valuable [[manuscript]]s and [[incunabulum|incunabula]]. It is considered one of only five remaining medieval libraries in Europe (the others being in England and Italy). This [[chained library]]'s books are still chained to their ancient wooden desk \u2013 a custom from centuries ago, when the \"public library\" used chains to prevent theft.\n\nHaving been fortified the town withstood several sieges, specially during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the most celebrated fight under its walls being the [[Battle of Zutphen]] in September 1586 when [[Sir Philip Sidney]] was mortally wounded. Taken by the Spanish in 1587 by the treachery of the English commander [[Rowland York]], Zutphen was [[Siege of Zutphen (1591)|recovered]] by [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice, prince of Orange]], in 1591, and except for two short periods, one in 1672 and the other during the French Revolutionary Wars, it has since then remained a part of the Netherlands. Its fortifications were dismantled in 1874. In [[World War II]] the town was bombed several times by the allied forces because the bridge over the IJssel was vital to support the German troops at Arnhem after the [[Operation Market Garden]]. After two weeks of battle the town was liberated on 14 April 1945. After the war a renovation program started. Nowadays Zutphen has one of the best preserved medieval town centres of northwestern Europe, including the remains of the medieval town wall and a few hundred buildings dating from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.\n\n==Modern city==\n[[File:Zutphen-plaats-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of the city of Zutphen, 2014]]\n[[File:20140421 IJsselkade en Walburgkerk Zutphen.jpg|thumb|The IJssel river in Zutphen]]\n[[File:29 March 2014, almost 20 degrees^ Real springtime at Zutphen innercity - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Zutphen's old city centre]]\nThe old center survived the [[World War II|Second World War]] almost in its entirety, though some parts of the city were lost, especially the area around the railway station, in the northern part of the city center, known as the {{lang|nl|Nieuwstad}} (English: New City). The city center includes many monumental buildings dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, and some even date back to the 13th century, such as a retirement home area. There are also remains of the old town walls in several places.\n\nToday, Zutphen is a modern small city. The urban area, which includes the village of Warnsveld, has about 51,000 inhabitants. Food shops are open from 8:30 am and other stores are open from 9:30 am to 6 pm on weekdays, on Friday evening until 9 pm and on Saturday until 5 pm. Some stores open earlier, and the larger supermarkets usually stay open until 10 pm.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Interesting buildings and squares ===\nBecause Zutphen contains a large number of historical buildings with a tower, Zutphen is often called the tower city. Because there are almost no modern high-rise buildings in the city centre the historical tower spires are very visible and form the skyline of Zutphen. The title of tower city is often used in advertising to draw tourists to Zutphen.\n\n==== Religious architecture ====\nThe Walburgis church was built as a Roman collegiate church around 1050, after that it was redecorated, rebuild and remodeled on several occasions. There are six bells in the tower, which are still rung by hand. \n\nSince 1561 a library called the Librije was added to the church. It was founded as a public library for the rich citizens of Zutphen. These days the library contains an important collection of 15th- to 17th-century books.\n\nThe Broederen (brothers) church is a large early 14th-century monastery church of the Dominican order. Since 1983 the church has been used as the city's public library, and it was recently been extensively restored. On top of the church there is a roof turret from 1771 that contains the porter's bell. This bell is still rung every day between 9:50 and 10:00 pm,  the time at which, until 1853, the city gates would be closed.\n\nThe Nieuwstads (new city) church houses the Catholic community. It was founded as a parish church around 1250. Since then it has been expanded, remodelled and restored many times. It has four original medieval bells.\n\n==== Civic architecture ====\nThe Drogenaps tower was built between 1444 and 1446 as a city gate. In 1465 the entrance was bricked up after which it became known as a tower instead of a gate. City musician Tonis Drogenap lived there around 1555 and the tower's current name is derived from him. From 1888 till 1927 the tower was used as a water tower.\n\nThe Wijnhuis (Winery) Tower was built between 1618 and 1642 by the city master builder Emond Hellenraet, influenced by Hendrick de Keyser. In 1644 the brothers Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony made the world's first correctly tuned carillon for this tower. During the summer months carillon concerts are regularly held.\n\nThe Bourgonje tower is a defensive turret build in 1457. It was built during the Gelderland-Burgundian war. The Dutch theologian and philosopher Johannes Florentius Martinet wrote his ''Katechismus der Natuur'' (Catechism of Nature) in this tower.\n\nThe Berkel gate is part of the city wall on the east side of the medieval city. This gate over the river Berkel connected the old city and the new city. It was built in 1320. It also had a western counterpart but that gate was demolished in 1772.\n\n==== Other interesting sights in Zutphen ====\nThe city of Zutphen had almost 400 national monuments and over 500 local monuments. It is one of the most important and well-preserved historical city centres in the Netherlands. Zutphen has a great many medieval, especially 14th-century, houses. These houses, often with ornamental facades, can be spotted all through the city centre.\n\nWhen walking along the old city market you will see several large 18th- and 19th-century buildings that used to belong to well-to-do citizens and merchants.\n\n==Regional center==\n===Juridical centre===\nZutphen, although a relatively small town, houses one of the Netherlands' 13 [[court]]s, the national training institution for judges and public prosecutors (SSR), the national police academy for senior police investigators, three prisons and a large number of lawyers. It is the early emergence of Zutphen in the Middle Ages as the main town of a [[county]] that explains its current position in the juridical system.\n\nBesides a 'normal' prison, one may find in Zutphen the [[JPC de Sprengen]] penitentiary facility for boys. There are several buildings: new institutions replacing the old facilities, but the old prisons remained open after completion of the new facilities. Only the old prison called Lunette did not meet today's standards and has closed in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite paper\n  | author = Min. of Justice, Inspectie voor Sanctietoepassing\n  | title = Inspectierapport Doorlichting PI Achterhoek, lokatie Lunette\n  | year = 2007\n  | url = http://www.inspectiesanctietoepassing.nl/images/Inspectierapport%20PI%20Achterhoek%20locatie%20Lunette_tcm56-75983.pdf\n  | format = [[PDF]]\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Medical centre===\nLocated in Zutphen is the \"Spittaal\", location of the [[Gelre Hospitals|Gelre Ziekenhuizen]] (Gelre Hospitals) group. This is a regular hospital offering all common specialities (no cardio-thoracic or neurosurgery) and a 24/7 emergency department. It is located in the southeastern part of the town, in the district of Leesten. A sizable number of practitioners of alternative medicine are located in Zutphen.\n\n===Educational centre===\nZutphen is home to several well-known schools for secondary education on all levels. These include the \"Het Stedelijk\" (Dalton plan education and bilingual education), \"Baudartius College\", \"Vrije School Zutphen\", (a \"Vrije School\" being a [[Waldorf School]]) and \"Isendoorn College\" (with bilingual education,located in Warnsveld). Students from a wide area around Zutphen learn at these schools.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Zutphen haven 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Port of Zutphen]]\n=== Rail ===\n[[Zutphen railway station]] is an important regional railway centre. The main electrified lines, to [[Deventer]] and [[Zwolle]] in the north, and to [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]] in the south, are run by the national railway company [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] (NS). The secondary lines to [[Winterswijk]] and [[Apeldoorn]] are operated by [[Arriva]]. The secondary line to [[Hengelo]] is operated by [[Blauwnet]] (a division of [[Syntus]]). The regional rail service is run by a special subsidiary of the NS. All secondary lines run diesel trains. Zutphen's old station building (1863), upgraded in 1875, was partly destroyed during [[World War II]]. In the early 1950s a modern new station was built, a typical post-war building with concrete as its main material.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | last = Bramer  \n  | first = Wichor\n  | title = Station Zutphen\n  | work = Railwaystations in the Netherlands\n  | publisher = Stationsweb\n  | date = 2008-01-31\n  | url = http://www.stationsweb.com/zutphen\n  | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}.\n</ref>\nHowever, in October 2007 the station building was designated as a State Monument. In 2006 and 2007, the area surrounding the railway station was completely renovated: a new bus terminal and an underground bicycle parking lot were constructed, and the main road leading from the railway station to the town centre was turned into a road for pedestrians and cyclists only.\n\n===Road===\nZutphen lies 10 kilometers south of the A1 motorway, which can be entered where it passes [[Deventer]]. From there the A1 leads East to [[Hengelo]] and West past [[Apeldoorn]] to [[Amsterdam]].

Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}</ref>\n\nThe Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar. The central tower of the temple is {{cvt|180|ft|m}} tall. The temple represents the quintessence of the [[Kalinga architecture]] and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswar.<ref name=\"Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra 1986 Page 69\"/> The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamsi dynasty]], with later additions from the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Ganga]] rulers. The temple is built in the ''[[Deula]]'' style that has four components namely, ''[[vimana]]'' (structure containing the sanctum), ''[[jagamohana]]'' (assembly hall), ''natamandira'' (festival hall) and ''bhoga-mandapa'' (hall of offerings), each increasing in the height to its predecessor. The temple complex has 50 other shrines and is enclosed by a large compound wall.\n\nBhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree (Ekamra) as noted in ''Ekamra Purana'', a 13th-century [[Sanskrit]] treatise. The temple is active in worship practises, unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar and Shiva is worshipped as [[Harihara]], a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva. The temple has images of Vishnu, possibly because of the rising prominence of [[Jagannath]] sect emanating from the Ganga rulers who built the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]] in the 12th century.\n\nLingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI). The temple has an average of 6,000 visitors per day and receives lakhs of visitors during festivals. [[Shivaratri]] festival is the major festival celebrated in the temple and event during 2012 witnessed 200,000 visitors.  The temple compound is not open to non-Hindus, but there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors.  This was originally erected for a visit by [[Lord Curzon]] when [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lingaraj Temple Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[vimana]] and temples in the Lingaraja Temple complex.]]\n[[File:Lingaraj temple Bhubaneswar 11005.jpg|thumb|left|Minor temples in the Lingaraja Temple complex.|alt=Image of a conical temple tower with smaller shrines around it.]]\nLingaraja, literally means the king of [[Lingam]], the iconic form of Shiva.

''Ekamra Purana'', a Sanskrit treatise of the 13th century mentions that the presiding deity was not seen as [[lingam]] (an aniconic form of Shiva) during the [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] and [[Treta yuga]]s and only during the [[Dvapara Yuga|Dwapara]] and [[Kali]] yugas, it emerged as a lingam. The lingam in the temple is a natural unshaped stone that rests on a Sakti. Such a lingam is called Krutibasa or [[Swayambhu]] and is found in 64 places in different parts of India. With the advent of the Ganga dynasty in the early 12th century, who had Vaishnavaite orientation, a new movement started resulting in the synthesis of [[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]]. The Ekamra was associated with Vaishanavite gods [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] during the period.<ref name=\"ekamra\">{{cite journal|title=Lingaraj Worship in Ekamra Kshetra |date=April 2011 |volume=LXVII |issue=9 |pages=61\u201362 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/april.pdf |journal=The Orissa Review |publisher=Government of Orissa |accessdate=29 December 2012 |last=Panda |first=Dr.Saroj Kumar |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203033726/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/april.pdf |archivedate= 3 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIt is attributed the raising prominence of Jagannath sect that became predominant during the construction of the temple. The Gangas remodelled the temple and introduced certain Vaishnavite elements like images of Vaishnava Dwarapalas namely Jaya and Prachanda, [[Jagannatha]], Lakshmi Narayan and [[Garuda]] were installed. Tulsi leaves, which are favoured by [[Vishnu]], was used along with Bela leaves for the worship of Lingaraja. Lingaraja thus came to be known as Harihara, a combination of Shiva and Vishnu. The flag of the temple was fixed to a Pinaka bow instead of trident usually found in Shiva temples. The temple priests also changed the mark in their forehead from horizontal to a \"U\" sign with a dotted middle line. The Gangas also introduced certain fairs like Swing festival, Sun worship and mock quarrel between priests after chariot festival, similar to the practises in Jagannath Temple in Puri. The influence of the Ganga dynasty has led to cosmopolitan culture, that has reduced the status of Lingaraja temple as a distinct Saivite shrine.<ref name=\"Bhubaneswar Lingaraj Temple\"/><ref name=\"ekamra\"/>\n\n==Festival and worship practises==\nAs per Hindu legend, an underground river originating from the Lingaraja temple fills the [[Bindusagar Tank]] (meaning ocean drop) and the water is believed to heal physical and spiritual illness.

The central tower of the temple is {{cvt|180|ft|m}} tall. The temple represents the quintessence of the [[Kalinga architecture]] and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswar.<ref name=\"Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra 1986 Page 69\"/> The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamsi dynasty]], with later additions from the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Ganga]] rulers. The temple is built in the ''[[Deula]]'' style that has four components namely, ''[[vimana]]'' (structure containing the sanctum), ''[[jagamohana]]'' (assembly hall), ''natamandira'' (festival hall) and ''bhoga-mandapa'' (hall of offerings), each increasing in the height to its predecessor. The temple complex has 50 other shrines and is enclosed by a large compound wall.\n\nBhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree (Ekamra) as noted in ''Ekamra Purana'', a 13th-century [[Sanskrit]] treatise. The temple is active in worship practises, unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar and Shiva is worshipped as [[Harihara]], a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva. The temple has images of Vishnu, possibly because of the rising prominence of [[Jagannath]] sect emanating from the Ganga rulers who built the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] in [[Puri]] in the 12th century.\n\nLingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI). The temple has an average of 6,000 visitors per day and receives lakhs of visitors during festivals. [[Shivaratri]] festival is the major festival celebrated in the temple and event during 2012 witnessed 200,000 visitors.  The temple compound is not open to non-Hindus, but there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors.  This was originally erected for a visit by [[Lord Curzon]] when [[Viceroy of India|Viceroy]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lingaraj Temple Complex.jpg|thumb|left|Central [[vimana]] and temples in the Lingaraja Temple complex.]]\n[[File:Lingaraj temple Bhubaneswar 11005.jpg|thumb|left|Minor temples in the Lingaraja Temple complex.|alt=Image of a conical temple tower with smaller shrines around it.]]\nLingaraja, literally means the king of [[Lingam]], the iconic form of Shiva. Shiva was originally worshipped as Kirtivasa and later as Harihara and is commonly referred to as Tribhuvaneshwara (also called Bhubaneswar), the master of three worlds, namely, heaven, earth, and netherworld. His consort is called [[Bhuvaneshvari]].\n\nThe temple in its present form dates back to the last decade of the eleventh century.

''Ekamra Purana'', a Sanskrit treatise of the 13th century mentions that the presiding deity was not seen as [[lingam]] (an aniconic form of Shiva) during the [[Satya Yuga|Satya]] and [[Treta yuga]]s and only during the [[Dvapara Yuga|Dwapara]] and [[Kali]] yugas, it emerged as a lingam. The lingam in the temple is a natural unshaped stone that rests on a Sakti. Such a lingam is called Krutibasa or [[Swayambhu]] and is found in 64 places in different parts of India. With the advent of the Ganga dynasty in the early 12th century, who had Vaishnavaite orientation, a new movement started resulting in the synthesis of [[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]]. The Ekamra was associated with Vaishanavite gods [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] during the period.<ref name=\"ekamra\">{{cite journal|title=Lingaraj Worship in Ekamra Kshetra |date=April 2011 |volume=LXVII |issue=9 |pages=61\u201362 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/april.pdf |journal=The Orissa Review |publisher=Government of Orissa |accessdate=29 December 2012 |last=Panda |first=Dr.Saroj Kumar |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203033726/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/april.pdf |archivedate= 3 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIt is attributed the raising prominence of Jagannath sect that became predominant during the construction of the temple. The Gangas remodelled the temple and introduced certain Vaishnavite elements like images of Vaishnava Dwarapalas namely Jaya and Prachanda, [[Jagannatha]], Lakshmi Narayan and [[Garuda]] were installed. Tulsi leaves, which are favoured by [[Vishnu]], was used along with Bela leaves for the worship of Lingaraja. Lingaraja thus came to be known as Harihara, a combination of Shiva and Vishnu. The flag of the temple was fixed to a Pinaka bow instead of trident usually found in Shiva temples. The temple priests also changed the mark in their forehead from horizontal to a \"U\" sign with a dotted middle line. The Gangas also introduced certain fairs like Swing festival, Sun worship and mock quarrel between priests after chariot festival, similar to the practises in Jagannath Temple in Puri. The influence of the Ganga dynasty has led to cosmopolitan culture, that has reduced the status of Lingaraja temple as a distinct Saivite shrine.<ref name=\"Bhubaneswar Lingaraj Temple\"/><ref name=\"ekamra\"/>\n\n==Festival and worship practises==\nAs per Hindu legend, an underground river originating from the Lingaraja temple fills the [[Bindusagar Tank]] (meaning ocean drop) and the water is believed to heal physical and spiritual illness.

[[Conium|Hemlock]] or hemlock flowers which are generally offered in other Shiva temples is not allowed in the Lingaraja temple. [[Aegle marmelos|Bilva]] leaves (Aegle marmelos) and [[tulasi]] (Ocimum sanctum) are used in daily worship. Offerings of cooked rice, curries and sweets are displayed in the ''bhogamandapa'' (hall of offering) and the divinity is invoked to accept them amidst scores of chanting of Sanskrit texts. Coconut, ripe plantains and [[Lia (food)|kora-khai]] are generally offered to Lingaraja by the pilgrims. [[Bhang]] beverage is offered to Lingaraja by some devotees especially on the day of [[Pana Sankranti]] (Odia new year).\n\nThe Lingaraja temple is open from 6 a.m. to about 9 p.m. and is intermittently closed during ''bhoga'' (food offering) to the deity. During early morning, lamps in the cella are lit to awaken Lingaraja from his sleep, ablution is performed, followed by adoration and ''[[arati]]'' (waving of light). The temple is closed at about 12 noon until about 3.30 p.m.  A ceremony is known as  ''Mahasnana'' (ablution)  is performed once the doors are closed, followed by pouring of ''[[Panchamrita]]'' (a mixture of milk, curdled milk, clarified butter, honey, and ghee) upon the deity for purification. At about 1:00&nbsp;p.m., a ripe plantain is divided into two, one half is offered to Sun god and the other half to Dwarapala (the guarding deities in the doorway).  Between 1 p.m. and 1:30&nbsp;p.m.  the food offering called ''Ballabha Bhoga'' (breakfast containing curdled milk, curd, and vegetables) is offered to the deity. The consecrated food is carried to the temple of Parvati and placed before her as an offering, a practice commonly observed by the orthodox Hindu housewives. At about 2 p.m., the ''Sakala Dhupa'' (morning's offering of food) takes place. After the food is offered to Lingaraja, the offerings are carried to the temple of Parvati to serve her.  An offering called ''Bhanda Dhupa'' is carried out at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. at the hall of the offering. This food is later offered by the inmates to the pilgrims as ''[[prasad|Mahaprasada]]''.\n\nA light refreshment known as ''Ballabha Dhupa'' is offered to the deity at around 4:30&nbsp;p.m. At around 5:00&nbsp;p.m., ''Dwipahar Dhupa'' (mid-day meal) is offered. At around 7 p.m., another offering called ''Palia Badu'' is placed before the deity. ''Sandhya arati'' (waving of lights in the evening) is performed during that time. Another light meal called ''Sahana Dhupa'' is offered at around 8:30&nbsp;p.m. After the meals, the ceremony of waving light (''arati'') is performed before the deity. At 9.30 p.m., the last service of the day, ''Bada Singara'' (the great decoration) is performed when the deity is decorated with flowers and ornaments after which a light food offering is made. A wooden palanquin is laid in the room, incense is lighted, drinking water is served and prepared betel is placed. Panchabaktra Mahadeva comes to the palanquin and returns to his own abode after the ''arati'' is performed. This is a bronze image of Mahadeva having five faces and Parvati in his lap.

{"title_page": "The Wool Road (New South Wales)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date = November 2019}}\n'''The Wool Road''' (also later known as 'The Old Wool Road') was a [[Historic roads|historic road]] of New South Wales, Australia, that ran from [[Nerriga, New South Wales|Nerriga]] to what is now [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] on [[Jervis Bay]]. It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia. The remainder of the original route still in use today is made up of a significant part of the Braidwood Road (MR92), Wandean Road, and a short section of the Princes Highway.[[File:Wandean Gap - Bottom of First Sideling of 1841 Wool Road in February 2019.jpg|thumb|256x256px|Wandean Gap - The bottom of the first of three steep sidelings on  Wandean Road (1841 Wool Road) that take it from the plateau of the Pigeon House Range to the ridge-line sloping toward the coast.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales. In the late 1820s and 1830s colonial settlement had spread to the vicinity of [[Lake George (New South Wales)|Lake George]], [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]], [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]], the Limestone Plains (now [[Canberra]]), and beyond to the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro district]]. The country settled was well-suited for the production of wool, for which there was a booming export market, but lay far from the existing port of Sydney. Transporting the [[wool bale]]s using the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the time involved a long and arduous journey from Braidwood\u2014taking around three weeks at the bullock's slow pace and with their need to stop for rest, feeding and watering\u2014via [[Bungonia, New South Wales|Bungonia]] and [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] to Sydney. The owner of [[Government House, Canberra#History of the site|Yarralumla]], [[Terence Aubrey Murray|Terence Murray]], further away at the Limestone Plains, complained that, in wet weather, the drays could take as long as three months to reach Sydney.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wilson|first=Gwendoline|title=Murray, Sir Terence Aubrey (1810\u20131873)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/murray-sir-terence-aubrey-2498|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1830s, a bridle-track known as the Corn Trail was made, from [[Clyde Mountain]] to the coastal [[Buckenbowra River|Buckenbowra Valley]], but it was steep and only usable by pack horses. Transport of wool in [[Wool bale|bales]] required a road that could be used by bullock drays.\n\nJervis Bay, a large sheltered bay that was suitable as a deepwater port lay far closer than Sydney but there was no road from Braidwood toward the coast beyond Nerriga. From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony. Convicts were a workforce that could be put to work on roadmaking.\n\n== Route ==\n[[File:Tianjara Creek looking north from Tianjara falls.jpg|thumb|209x209px|The valley of Tianjara Creek, looking north from Tianjara Falls.

The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]]. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga. The 1841 road traversed the ridge to the north of Bulee Mountain and went through the man-made Bulee Gap,<ref name=\":5\" />  whereas the 1856 alignment and the current road pass to the south of Bulee Mountain[[File:Sussex Inlet from Jerrawangala lookout.jpg|thumb|View from Jerrawangala lookout atop the coastal escarpment approx. 500m south of Wandean Gap.

Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, ''\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226356874|title=COUNTRY NEWS.|date=1842-01-08|work=Sydney Free Press (NSW : 1841 - 1842)|access-date=2019-02-02|pages=2}}</ref> A year later, in January 1843, an article in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] stated that, ''\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously clrculated respecting them by interested parties\"''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12413192|title=&quot;JERVIS BAY.|date=1843-01-11|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-12-09|pages=2}}</ref> There was some factual basis for such negative views.\n\nGeographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time.\n\nThe steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there. With hindsight, the route of The Wool Road via the Wandean Gap had been a poor choice; far better routes for roads over the coastal escarpment would be found later.\n\nThe truth about the road\u2014and the country through which it ran\u2014was very much contrary to the apparently exaggerated claims that had been made, when town allotments in South Huskisson had been sold for high prices in 1841.<ref name=\":15\" /> The country atop the Pidgeon House Range was infertile land that was unsuitable to provide grazing for the bullock teams, with the exception of the natural clearing at Yerock (or Yarrock) Flat\u2014known as McKenzie's Paddock<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sassafras : the story of the Post Town at Sassafras Mountain on the old Wool Road in the County of St. Vincent|last=Charles.|first=Snedden, Robert|date=1996|publisher=R C Snedden|isbn=0646259822|location=Duffy, A.C.T.|pages=22 & 24|oclc=38411506}}</ref>\u2014and the nearby area of volcanic soil around [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]].

It was constructed privately in 1841, using convict labour. Its purpose was to provide a shorter route to a seaport for wool grown at [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] and beyond.\n\nThe historical significance of The Wool Road is that it was the first road, capable of being used by wheeled vehicles, linking the inland area around [[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]] to the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]]. The road led to the foundation of the privately-owned port town of South Huskisson (called [[Vincentia, New South Wales|Vincentia]] since 1952) and the adjacent 'government townshIp' of [[Huskisson, New South Wales|Huskisson]].\n\nThe Wool Road's route made its use difficult and the port on Jervis Bay was not a success. In 1856, the original road was realigned and extended to [[Terara]] (near [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra]]) instead of Jervis Bay, becoming the Braidwood Road. The old route through the coastal escarpment to Jervis Bay fell into disuse for many years.\n\nMuch of the original route of The Wool Road remains in use today but some parts are accessible only to four-wheel drive traffic. Only a part of the original route that is currently in use is known as The Wool Road or The Old Wool Road today\u2014the section from the Princes Highway to Vincentia.

In the 1830s and 1840s, the Wandandian people still lived on their traditional lands.\n\nThe land also lay within the [[St Vincent County|County of St. Vincent]], one of the [[Nineteen Counties]] in which white settlement was permitted by the colonial government of New South Wales.

From 1831, there were sea-going auxiliary steamships\u2014such as the ''[[Sophia Jane]]''\u2014operating in New South Wales but steam powered railways were not in place before the mid-1850s.\n\nAlthough transportation of [[Convicts in Australia|convicts]] to New South Wales had ceased in 1840, it was still a penal colony.

The significant geographical obstacles to be overcome were crossing the [[Endrick River]] near Nerriga, climbing to a plateau in the northern part of the Pigeon House Range, then avoiding the steep valleys and gorges cut into that plateau by tributaries of the [[Shoalhaven River|Shoalhaven]] and [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde]] rivers, and subsequently descending from the plateau to the coastal plain to reach Jervis Bay.\n\nAfter fording the Endrick River, The Wool Road broadly followed the direction of the modern-day Braidwood Road (MR92), from Nerriga to near the Boolijah Peak, a point east of [[Sassafras, New South Wales|Sassafras]]. The current Braidwood Road alignment is the result of an upgrade in 1856. The original 1841 road's exact route was different in some places, most significantly where it climbs the Pigeon House Range at Bulee Mountain near Nerriga.

Soon after the road opened, in January 1842, an anonymous report of difficulties using it appeared, which included a prediction that, ''\"it is doubtful if ever it will be completed and when finished, a constant thoroughfare to the sea coast; inasmuch as the route is chiefly barren scrub, and badly watered.\"''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article226356874|title=COUNTRY NEWS.|date=1842-01-08|work=Sydney Free Press (NSW : 1841 - 1842)|access-date=2019-02-02|pages=2}}</ref> A year later, in January 1843, an article in the [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] stated that, ''\"The township, the wharf, and the road, have all still to contend against the evil reports which have been so industriously clrculated respecting them by interested parties\"''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12413192|title=&quot;JERVIS BAY.|date=1843-01-11|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-12-09|pages=2}}</ref> There was some factual basis for such negative views.\n\nGeographic and economic difficulties affected The Wool Road and these, rather than the 'evil reports', caused it to fall into disuse after a relatively short time.\n\nThe steep descent proved a problem for the cumbersome [[Bullocky|bullock drays]] of the day. Although the distance was short, the slowness of the fully laden bullock drays descending the steep route led to ships being delayed at Jervis Bay and on at least one occasion leaving without taking on a cargo there.

It features a hydraulically retractable tricycle-type landing gear. The single-wheeled main units retract inward and the twin nose wheel unit retracts forward. About a quarter of the aircraft's line replaceable units are common between it and the [[HAL Tejas]] trainer variant.\n\nIn the cockpit, the HJT-36 has a conventional tandem two-seat configuration with the trainee pilot forward and the instructor in the raised seat to the rear. The single-piece canopy gives both pilots good, all-round vision. The prototype aircraft used [[NPP Zvezda|Zvezda]] K-26LT lightweight [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s. However, these may be replaced with [[Martin-Baker]] Mk.16 IN16S seats, due to a price escalation of the former.<ref name=\"supplier\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?program=641|title=HAL HJT-36 Sitara - program supplier guide|website=www.airframer.com}}</ref> The pilots have both conventional and manual flight controls.<ref name=at-hjt/>\n\nThe trainer has a full glass cockpit with a layout similar to current generation combat aircraft. It uses an integrated digital avionics system from [[GE Aviation Systems]].

There is one centre-line hardpoint under the fuselage and two weapon pylons under each wing for carrying rockets, gun pods and bombs. The maximum external payload is 1,000&nbsp;kg.\n\nThe prototype aircraft were initially powered by a [[SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac 04-H-20]] non-afterburning [[turbofan]] developing 14.12&nbsp;kN of thrust. All production models will use the more powerful [[NPO Saturn AL-55I]] engine with about 16.9&nbsp;kN of thrust, as stipulated by the 2005 air staff requirements from the Air Force.\n\n== Specifications (HJT-36, prototypes) ==\n[[File:Profil HAL HJT-36.png|right|300px]]\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All the World's Aircraft<ref name=\"jawa-1617\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Jackson|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Peacock|editor2-first=Lindsay|editor3-last=Bushell|editor3-first=Susan|editor4-last=Willis|editor4-first=David|editor5-last=Winchester|editor5-first=Jim|title=IHS Jane's All the World's Aircraft: Development & Production|date=2016\u20132017|location=Couldson|isbn=978-0710631770|page=304|chapter=India}}</ref>\n|prime units?=met<!-- imp or kts first for US aircraft, and UK aircraft pre-metrification, \nmet(ric) first for all others.

The lines from pole to pole are lines of constant [[longitude]], or '''meridians'''. The circles parallel to the [[equator]] are lines of constant latitude, or '''parallels'''. The graticule shows the latitude and longitude of points on the surface. In this example meridians are spaced at 6\u00b0 intervals and parallels at 4\u00b0 intervals.]]\n\nIn [[geography]], '''latitude''' is a [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]] that specifies the [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the [[Equator]] to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or ''parallels'', run east\u2013west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [[longitude]] to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the ''geodetic latitude'' as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal]]'') to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six ''auxiliary latitudes'' which are used in special applications.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the [[geoid]], a surface which approximates the [[Sea level|mean sea level]] over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a [[sphere]], but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the ''actual'' surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of [[Altitude|height]] constitute a [[geographic coordinate system]] as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.{{efn|The current full documentation of ISO 19111 may be purchased from http://www.iso.org but drafts of the final standard are freely available at many web sites, one such is available at the following\n[https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/Xmml/CoordinateReferenceSystems/19111_FDIS20021107.pdf CSIRO]}}\n\nSince there are many different [[reference ellipsoid]]s, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that \"without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst\". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.\n\nIn English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter [[phi (letter)|phi]] ({{mvar|\u03c6}} or {{mvar|\u03d5}}). It is measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[arcminute|minutes and seconds]] or [[decimal degrees]], north or south of the equator.\n<!--The latitude of a point on the reference surface is defined as the angle between the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference surface (at the point in question) and the equatorial plane. A corollary of this definition is that the latitude angle of a point on the reference surface is not unique: it depends on the precise choice of the reference surface. -->\n\nThe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up [[theodolite]]s or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the [[figure of the Earth]] together with its gravitational field is the science of [[geodesy]].\n<!-- here except in relation to the definition of the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].-->\n\nThis article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.\n\n==Latitude on the sphere==\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on a sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A perspective view of the Earth showing how latitude (<math>\\phi</math>) and longitude (<math>\\lambda</math>) are defined on a spherical model. The graticule spacing is 10 degrees.]]\n\n===The graticule on the sphere===\nThe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the [[Geographical pole|poles]] where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the [[Prime Meridian]]) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the [[Equator]]. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0\u00b0, the [[North Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 North (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;N or +90\u00b0), and the [[South Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 South (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;S or \u221290\u00b0). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is  along the radius vector.\n\nThe latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.\n\n===Named latitudes on the Earth===\n[[File:December solstice geometry.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The orientation of the Earth at the December solstice.]]\nBesides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| [[Arctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Cancer]] ||23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Capricorn]] || 23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) S\n|-\n| [[Antarctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) S\n|}\nThe plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the [[ecliptic]], and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by {{mvar|i}}. The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to {{mvar|i}} and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90\u00b0 - ''i''). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on [[axial tilt]].{{efn|The value of this angle today is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}. This figure is provided by [[Template:Circle of latitude]].}}\n\nThe figure shows the geometry of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December [[solstice]] when the Sun is overhead at some point of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The south polar latitudes below the [[Antarctic Circle]] are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two [[tropics]] is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]).\n\nOn [[map projections]] there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.\n{| style=\"text-align:left\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-valign=top\n! width=\"1%\" |\n! width=\"36%\"|Normal Mercator\n! width=\"3%\"|\n! width=\"36%\" |Transverse Mercator\n! width=\"1%\" |\n|-valign=top\n|\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercNormSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|\n\\\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercTranSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|}\n\n===Meridian distance on the sphere===\nOn the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) is\ntherefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]] is denoted by {{math|''m''(''\u03c6'')}} then\n:<math> m(\\phi)=\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}R\\phi_\\mathrm{degrees} = R\\phi_\\mathrm{radians}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|R}} denotes the [[Earth radius#Mean radii|mean radius]] of the Earth. {{mvar|R}} is equal to {{convert|6371|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}. No higher accuracy is appropriate for {{mvar|R}} since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for {{mvar|R}} the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is {{convert|111.2|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is {{convert|1.853|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is {{convert|30.8|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}} (see [[nautical mile]]).\n\n==Latitude on the ellipsoid==\n\n===Ellipsoids===\n\n{{main|Ellipsoid}}\nIn 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] ellipsoid.<ref name=newton>{{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Newton|title=Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|chapter=Book III Proposition XIX Problem III|page= [https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/407 407] |translator-first=Andrew |translator-last=Motte |url=https://archive.org/details/100878576}}</ref> (This article uses the term ''ellipsoid'' in preference to the older term ''spheroid''.) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See [[Meridian arc]].) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). \"Oblate ellipsoid of revolution\" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)\n\nMany different [[Figure of the Earth|reference ellipsoids]] have been used in the history of [[geodesy]]. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the [[geoid]] over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of [[GPS]], it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as [[WGS84]]) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out [[Datum (geodesy)|datum transformations]] which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.\n\n===The geometry of the ellipsoid===\n[[File:Ellipsoid parametric euler mono.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed along the ''z'' axis to form an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]\n\nThe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the [[ellipse]] which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the [[ellipse|semi-major axis]], {{mvar|a}}. The other parameter is usually (1)&nbsp;the polar radius or [[ellipse|semi-minor axis]], {{mvar|b}}; or (2)&nbsp;the (first) [[flattening]], {{mvar|f}}; or (3)&nbsp;the [[ellipse|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}. These parameters are not independent: they are related by\n\n:<math>f=\\frac{a-b}{a}, \\qquad e^2=2f-f^2,\\qquad b=a(1-f)=a\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\,.</math>\nMany other parameters (see [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]]) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}}. Both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}} are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order {{sfrac|1|298}} and 0.0818 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in [[Figure of the Earth]]. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the ''inverse'' flattening, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}}. For example, the defining values for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.htmlNIMA |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication |title=TR8350.2 |pages=3\u20131 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* {{mvar|a}} (equatorial radius): {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} exactly\n* {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}} (inverse flattening): {{val|298.257223563}} exactly\nfrom which are derived\n* {{mvar|b}} (polar radius): {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}\n* {{math|''e''<sup>2</sup>}} (eccentricity squared): {{val|0.00669437999014}}\nThe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}} and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.\n\n===Geodetic and geocentric latitudes===\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) and longitude ({{mvar|\u03bb}}) on an ellipsoid. The normal to the surface does not pass through the centre, except at the equator and at the poles.]]\nThe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:\n\n*{{anchor|Geodetic}}'''Geodetic latitude:''' the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The standard notation in English publications is {{mvar|\u03c6}}. This is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification. The definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid.\n*{{anchor|Geocentric}}'''Geocentric latitude:''' the angle between the radius (from centre to the point on the surface) and the equatorial plane. (Figure [[#Geocentric latitude|below]]). There is no standard notation: examples from various texts include {{mvar|\u03b8}}, {{mvar|\u03c8}}, {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|\u03c6\u2032}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>c</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>g</sub>}}. This article uses {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n*'''Spherical latitude:''' the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane.\n*'''Geographic latitude''' must be used with care. Some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].\n*'''Latitude''' (unqualified) should normally refer to the geodetic latitude.\n\nThe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the [[Eiffel Tower]] has a geodetic latitude of 48\u00b0&nbsp;51\u2032&nbsp;29\u2033&nbsp;N, or 48.8583\u00b0&nbsp;N and longitude of 2\u00b0&nbsp;17\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033&nbsp;E or 2.2944\u00b0E. The same coordinates on the datum [[ED50]] define a point on the ground which is {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=off}} distant from the tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.\n\n===Length of a degree of latitude===\n{{main|Meridian arc}}\nIn [[Meridian arc]] and standard texts<ref name=torge>{{cite book|last=Torge |first=W. |date=2001 |title=Geodesy |edition=3rd |publisher=De Gruyter |isbn=3-11-017072-8}}</ref><ref name=osborne/><ref name=rapp/> it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} to the equator is given by ({{mvar|\u03c6}} in radians)\n\n:<math>m(\\phi) = \\int_0^\\phi M(\\phi')\\, d\\phi' = a\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\int_0^\\phi \\left(1 - e^2 \\sin^2\\phi'\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\, d\\phi'</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''M''(''\u03c6'')}} is the meridional [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].\n\nThe distance from the equator to the pole is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm{p} = m\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\,</math>\n\nFor [[WGS84]] this distance is {{val|10001.965729|u=km}}.\n\nThe evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection.

An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude. This was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metres.  However, for all practical purposes distances are measured from the latitude scale of charts.  As the [[Royal Yachting Association]] says in its manual for [[Day Skipper|day skipper]]s: \"1 (minute) of Latitude = 1 sea mile\", followed by \"For most practical purposes distance is measured from the latitude scale, assuming that one minute of latitude equals one nautical mile\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Sara|title=RYA day skipper handbook - sail|year=2012|isbn=9781-9051-04949|publisher=The Royal Yachting Association|place=Hamble|p=76}}</ref>\n\n==Auxiliary latitudes==\n\nThere are six '''auxiliary latitudes''' that have applications to special problems in geodesy, geophysics and the theory of map projections:\n* Geocentric latitude\n* Parametric (or reduced) latitude\n* Rectifying latitude\n* Authalic latitude\n* Conformal latitude\n* Isometric latitude\nThe definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes, like the geodetic latitude, can be extended to define a three-dimensional [[geographic coordinate system]] as discussed [[#Latitude and coordinate systems|below]]. The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used ''only'' as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, and the eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}.

(See also [[Mercator projection#Alternative expressions|Mercator projection]].)\n\nThe conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of ''arbitrary'' radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of ''small'' elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).\n\n===Isometric latitude===\nThe '''isometric latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c8}}, is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. The name \"isometric\" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of {{mvar|\u03c8}} and longitude {{mvar|\u03bb}} give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] defined by the lines of constant {{mvar|\u03c8}} and constant {{mvar|\u03bb}}, divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):<ref name=snyder/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\psi(\\phi) &= \\ln\\left[\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)\\right] +\n                  \\frac{e}{2}\\ln\\left[\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) -e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi) \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi)-e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor the ''normal'' Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is {{mvar|E}} (units of length or pixels) then the distance, {{mvar|y}}, of a parallel of latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} from the equator is\n:<math>y(\\phi) = \\frac{E}{2\\pi}\\psi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\nThe isometric latitude {{mvar|\u03c8}} is closely related to the conformal latitude {{mvar|\u03c7}}:\n:<math>\\psi(\\phi) = \\operatorname{gd}^{-1} \\chi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\n===Inverse formulae and series===\nThe formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are [[fixed-point iteration]] and [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson]] root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of [[Lagrange reversion]]. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity.<ref name=adams1921/> Osborne<ref name=osborne/> derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ |title=Maxima computer algebra system |website=[[Sourceforge]]}}</ref> and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.\n\n===Numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes===\n[[File:Auxiliary Latitudes Difference.svg|inline|right]]\nThe plot to the right shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid. The differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes. \nIn the Northern hemisphere (positive latitudes), ''\u03b8'' \u2264 ''\u03c7'' \u2264 ''\u03bc'' \u2264 ''\u03be'' \u2264 ''\u03b2'' \u2264 ''\u03c6''; in the Southern hemisphere (negative latitudes), the inequalities are reversed, with equality at the equator and the poles. Although the graph appears symmetric about 45\u00b0, the minima of the curves actually lie between 45\u00b0 2\u2032 and 45\u00b0 6\u2032. Some representative data points are given in the table below.

To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.\n\n===Geodetic coordinates===\n[[File:Geodetic coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}}]]\nAt an arbitrary point {{math|P}} consider the line {{math|PN}} which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}} are the latitude and longitude of the point {{math|N}} on the ellipsoid and the distance {{math|PN}}. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of {{math|PN}} will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.\n\n===Spherical polar coordinates===\n\n[[File:Geocentric coords 02.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe geocentric latitude {{mvar|\u03b8}} is the complement of the polar angle {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} in conventional [[spherical polar coordinates]] in which the coordinates of a point are {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}} where {{mvar|r}} is the distance of {{math|P}} from the centre {{math|O}}, {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and {{mvar|\u03bb}} is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points {{math|P'}} on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.\n\n===Ellipsoidal coordinates===\n[[File:Ellipsoidal coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ellipsoidal coordinates {{math|P(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point {{math|P}} not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes {{math|OA}} and {{math|OB}}) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci {{math|F}}, {{math|F\u2032}}) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product {{mvar|ae}} of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let {{mvar|u}} be the semi-minor axis ({{math|OD}}) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let {{mvar|\u03b2}} be the parametric latitude of {{math|P}} on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set {{math|(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}} define the ellipsoid coordinates.<ref name=torge/>{{rp|\u00a74.2.2}} These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.\n\n===Coordinate conversions===\nThe relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in [[Geographic coordinate conversion]]. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in [[Spherical coordinate system]]. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.<ref name=torge/>\n\n==Astronomical latitude==\n'''Astronomical latitude''' ({{math|\u03a6}}) is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a [[plumb line]], is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the [[gravitational acceleration]] (mass-based) and the [[centrifugal acceleration]] at that latitude.<ref name=torge/> Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the [[zenith]] and stars whose [[declination]] is accurately known.\n\nIn general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.<ref name=torge/><ref name=wellenhofmoritz>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1=B. |last2=Moritz |first2=H. |date=2006 |title=Physical Geodesy |edition=2nd |isbn=3-211-33544-7}}</ref> The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape \"at mean sea level\". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.\n\nAstronomical latitude is not to be confused with [[declination]], the coordinate [[astronomer]]s use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[celestial equator]] (see [[equatorial coordinates]]), nor with [[ecliptic latitude]], the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[ecliptic]] (see [[ecliptic coordinates]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Altitude]] ([[sea level|mean sea level]])\n*[[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator]]\n*[[Cardinal direction]]\n*[[Circle of latitude]]\n*[[Declination]] on [[celestial sphere]]\n*[[Degree Confluence Project]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n*[[Geodetic datum]]\n*[[Geographic coordinate system]]\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Geotagging]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[History of latitude measurements]]\n*[[Horse latitudes]]\n*[[List of countries by latitude]]\n*[[Longitude]]\n*[[Natural Area Code]]\n*[[Navigation]]\n*[[Orders of magnitude (length)]]\n*[[World Geodetic System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks}}\n*[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ GEONets Names Server], access to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]'s (NGA) database of foreign geographic feature names.\n*[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cvm/latlon_find_location.html Resources for determining your latitude and longitude]\n*[http://geography.about.com/library/howto/htdegrees.htm Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds] - Info about decimal to [[sexagesimal]] conversion\n*[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds]\n*[http://www.marinewaypoints.com/learn/greatcircle.shtml Distance calculation based on latitude and longitude] - JavaScript version\n*[https://www.academia.edu/12297694/16th_Century_Latitude_Survey 16th Century Latitude Survey]\n*[http://www.longcamp.com/nav.html Determination of Latitude by Francis Drake on the Coast of California in 1579]\n\n{{geographical coordinates|state=collapsed}}\n{{Map projection}}\n\n[[Category:Lines of latitude| ]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the geographical reference system}}\n{{short description|geographic coordinate specifying north\u2013south position}}\n{{more sources|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Division of the Earth into Gauss-Krueger zones - Globe.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the Earth as a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]].

The graticule shows the latitude and longitude of points on the surface. In this example meridians are spaced at 6\u00b0 intervals and parallels at 4\u00b0 intervals.]]\n\nIn [[geography]], '''latitude''' is a [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinate]] that specifies the [[north]]\u2013[[south]] position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0\u00b0 at the [[Equator]] to 90\u00b0 (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or ''parallels'', run east\u2013west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with [[longitude]] to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. On its own, the term latitude should be taken to be the ''geodetic latitude'' as defined below. Briefly, geodetic latitude at a point is the angle formed by the vector perpendicular (or ''[[Normal (geometry) |  normal]]'') to the ellipsoidal surface from that point, and the equatorial plane. Also defined are six ''auxiliary latitudes'' which are used in special applications.\n\n==Preliminaries==\nTwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the [[geoid]], a surface which approximates the [[Sea level|mean sea level]] over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a [[sphere]], but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the ''actual'' surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of [[Altitude|height]] constitute a [[geographic coordinate system]] as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.{{efn|The current full documentation of ISO 19111 may be purchased from http://www.iso.org but drafts of the final standard are freely available at many web sites, one such is available at the following\n[https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/pub/Xmml/CoordinateReferenceSystems/19111_FDIS20021107.pdf CSIRO]}}\n\nSince there are many different [[reference ellipsoid]]s, the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique: this is stressed in the ISO standard which states that \"without the full specification of the coordinate reference system, coordinates (that is latitude and longitude) are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst\". This is of great importance in accurate applications, such as a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), but in common usage, where high accuracy is not required, the reference ellipsoid is not usually stated.\n\nIn English texts the latitude angle, defined below, is usually denoted by the Greek lower-case letter [[phi (letter)|phi]] ({{mvar|\u03c6}} or {{mvar|\u03d5}}). It is measured in [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[arcminute|minutes and seconds]] or [[decimal degrees]], north or south of the equator.\n<!--The latitude of a point on the reference surface is defined as the angle between the [[Surface normal|normal]] to the reference surface (at the point in question) and the equatorial plane. A corollary of this definition is that the latitude angle of a point on the reference surface is not unique: it depends on the precise choice of the reference surface. -->\n\nThe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up [[theodolite]]s or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the [[figure of the Earth]] together with its gravitational field is the science of [[geodesy]].\n<!-- here except in relation to the definition of the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].-->\n\nThis article relates to coordinate systems for the Earth: it may be extended to cover the Moon, planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclature.\n\n==Latitude on the sphere==\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on a sphere.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A perspective view of the Earth showing how latitude (<math>\\phi</math>) and longitude (<math>\\lambda</math>) are defined on a spherical model. The graticule spacing is 10 degrees.]]\n\n===The graticule on the sphere===\nThe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the [[Geographical pole|poles]] where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the [[Prime Meridian]]) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the [[Equator]]. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0\u00b0, the [[North Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 North (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;N or +90\u00b0), and the [[South Pole]] has a latitude of 90\u00b0 South (written 90\u00b0&nbsp;S or \u221290\u00b0). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal to the surface of the sphere is  along the radius vector.\n\nThe latitude, as defined in this way for the sphere, is often termed the spherical latitude, to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this article.\n\n===Named latitudes on the Earth===\n[[File:December solstice geometry.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The orientation of the Earth at the December solstice.]]\nBesides the equator, four other parallels are of significance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n| [[Arctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Cancer]] ||23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) N\n|-\n| [[Tropic of Capricorn]] || 23\u00b0 26\u2032 (23.43\u00b0) S\n|-\n| [[Antarctic Circle]] || 66\u00b0 34\u2032 (66.57\u00b0) S\n|}\nThe plane of the Earth's orbit about the Sun is called the [[ecliptic]], and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the Earth is the equatorial plane. The angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt, the obliquity, or the inclination of the ecliptic, and it is conventionally denoted by {{mvar|i}}. The latitude of the tropical circles is equal to {{mvar|i}} and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement (90\u00b0 - ''i''). The axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]. The time variation is discussed more fully in the article on [[axial tilt]].{{efn|The value of this angle today is {{circle of latitude|tropical|convert}}. This figure is provided by [[Template:Circle of latitude]].}}\n\nThe figure shows the geometry of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the Earth and the Sun at the December [[solstice]] when the Sun is overhead at some point of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The south polar latitudes below the [[Antarctic Circle]] are in daylight, whilst the north polar latitudes above the Arctic Circle are in night. The situation is reversed at the June solstice, when the Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. Only at latitudes in between the two [[tropics]] is it possible for the Sun to be directly overhead (at the [[zenith]]).\n\nOn [[map projections]] there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear. The examples below show the named parallels (as red lines) on the commonly used [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. On the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical, whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical: both are complicated curves.\n{| style=\"text-align:left\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-valign=top\n! width=\"1%\" |\n! width=\"36%\"|Normal Mercator\n! width=\"3%\"|\n! width=\"36%\" |Transverse Mercator\n! width=\"1%\" |\n|-valign=top\n|\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercNormSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|\n\\\n| align=\"center\" width=\"200px\" | [[File:MercTranSph enhanced.png|center|200px]]\n|}\n\n===Meridian distance on the sphere===\nOn the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) is\ntherefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned. If the [[Meridian arc|meridian distance]] is denoted by {{math|''m''(''\u03c6'')}} then\n:<math> m(\\phi)=\\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ}R\\phi_\\mathrm{degrees} = R\\phi_\\mathrm{radians}</math>\nwhere {{mvar|R}} denotes the [[Earth radius#Mean radii|mean radius]] of the Earth. {{mvar|R}} is equal to {{convert|6371|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=in}}. No higher accuracy is appropriate for {{mvar|R}} since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model. With this value for {{mvar|R}} the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is {{convert|111.2|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (60.0 nautical miles). The length of 1 minute of latitude is {{convert|1.853|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=preunit||statute }} (1.00 nautical miles), while the length of 1 second of latitude is {{convert|30.8|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=in}} (see [[nautical mile]]).\n\n==Latitude on the ellipsoid==\n\n===Ellipsoids===\n\n{{main article|Ellipsoid}}\nIn 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] ellipsoid.<ref name=newton>{{cite book|first=Isaac |last=Newton|title=Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|chapter=Book III Proposition XIX Problem III|page= [https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/407 407] |translator-first=Andrew |translator-last=Motte |url=https://archive.org/details/100878576}}</ref> (This article uses the term ''ellipsoid'' in preference to the older term ''spheroid''.) Newton's result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century. (See [[Meridian arc]].) An oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis (minor axis). \"Oblate ellipsoid of revolution\" is abbreviated to 'ellipsoid' in the remainder of this article. (Ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxial.)\n\nMany different [[Figure of the Earth|reference ellipsoids]] have been used in the history of [[geodesy]]. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the [[geoid]] over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of [[GPS]], it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids (such as [[WGS84]]) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out [[Datum (geodesy)|datum transformations]] which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.\n\n===The geometry of the ellipsoid===\n[[File:Ellipsoid parametric euler mono.svg|thumb|right|200px |A sphere of radius ''a'' compressed along the ''z'' axis to form an oblate ellipsoid of revolution.]]\n\nThe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the [[ellipse]] which is rotated about its minor (shorter) axis. Two parameters are required. One is invariably the equatorial radius, which is the [[ellipse|semi-major axis]], {{mvar|a}}. The other parameter is usually (1)&nbsp;the polar radius or [[ellipse|semi-minor axis]], {{mvar|b}}; or (2)&nbsp;the (first) [[flattening]], {{mvar|f}}; or (3)&nbsp;the [[ellipse|eccentricity]], {{mvar|e}}. These parameters are not independent: they are related by\n\n:<math>f=\\frac{a-b}{a}, \\qquad e^2=2f-f^2,\\qquad b=a(1-f)=a\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\,.</math>\nMany other parameters (see [[ellipse]], [[ellipsoid]]) appear in the study of geodesy, geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}}. Both {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|e}} are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations; they are of the order {{sfrac|1|298}} and 0.0818 respectively. Values for a number of ellipsoids are given in [[Figure of the Earth]]. Reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the ''inverse'' flattening, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}}. For example, the defining values for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid, used by all GPS devices, are<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350_2.htmlNIMA |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication |title=TR8350.2 |page=3\u20131 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* {{mvar|a}} (equatorial radius): {{val|6378137.0|u=m}} exactly\n* {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}}}} (inverse flattening): {{val|298.257223563}} exactly\nfrom which are derived\n* {{mvar|b}} (polar radius): {{val|6356752.3142|u=m}}\n* {{math|''e''<sup>2</sup>}} (eccentricity squared): {{val|0.00669437999014}}\nThe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=in}} and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening; on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels. This would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere, so illustrations usually exaggerate the flattening.\n\n===Geodetic and geocentric latitudes===\n[[File:latitude and longitude graticule on an ellipsoid.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The definition of geodetic latitude ({{mvar|\u03c6}}) and longitude ({{mvar|\u03bb}}) on an ellipsoid. The normal to the surface does not pass through the centre, except at the equator and at the poles.]]\nThe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing:\n\n*{{anchor|Geodetic}}'''Geodetic latitude:''' the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The standard notation in English publications is {{mvar|\u03c6}}. This is the definition assumed when the word latitude is used without qualification. The definition must be accompanied with a specification of the ellipsoid.\n*{{anchor|Geocentric}}'''Geocentric latitude:''' the angle between the radius (from centre to the point on the surface) and the equatorial plane. (Figure [[#Geocentric latitude|below]]). There is no standard notation: examples from various texts include {{mvar|\u03b8}}, {{mvar|\u03c8}}, {{mvar|q}}, {{mvar|\u03c6\u2032}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>c</sub>}}, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>g</sub>}}. This article uses {{mvar|\u03b8}}.\n*'''Spherical latitude:''' the angle between the normal to a spherical reference surface and the equatorial plane.\n*'''Geographic latitude''' must be used with care. Some authors use it as a synonym for geodetic latitude whilst others use it as an alternative to the [[#Astronomical latitude|astronomical latitude]].\n*'''Latitude''' (unqualified) should normally refer to the geodetic latitude.\n\nThe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example. On the reference ellipsoid for WGS84, the centre of the [[Eiffel Tower]] has a geodetic latitude of 48\u00b0&nbsp;51\u2032&nbsp;29\u2033&nbsp;N, or 48.8583\u00b0&nbsp;N and longitude of 2\u00b0&nbsp;17\u2032&nbsp;40\u2033&nbsp;E or 2.2944\u00b0E. The same coordinates on the datum [[ED50]] define a point on the ground which is {{convert|140|m|ft|abbr=off}} distant from the tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower; the reference ellipsoid is rarely specified.\n\n===Length of a degree of latitude===\n{{main article|Meridian arc}}\nIn [[Meridian arc]] and standard texts<ref name=torge>{{cite book|last=Torge |first=W. |date=2001 |title=Geodesy |edition=3rd |publisher=De Gruyter |isbn=3-11-017072-8}}</ref><ref name=osborne/><ref name=rapp/> it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} to the equator is given by ({{mvar|\u03c6}} in radians)\n\n:<math>m(\\phi) = \\int_0^\\phi M(\\phi')\\, d\\phi' = a\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\int_0^\\phi \\left(1 - e^2 \\sin^2\\phi'\\right)^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\, d\\phi'</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''M''(''\u03c6'')}} is the meridional [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]].\n\nThe distance from the equator to the pole is\n\n:<math>m_\\mathrm{p} = m\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\,</math>\n\nFor [[WGS84]] this distance is {{val|10001.965729|u=km}}.\n\nThe evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection.

The remaining latitudes are not used in this way; they are used ''only'' as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid. Their numerical values are not of interest. For example, no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nThe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude, the semi-major axis, {{mvar|a}}, and the eccentricity, {{mvar|e}}.

The sphere may then be projected to the plane with an [[equirectangular projection]] to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale. An example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the [[equidistant conic projection]]. (Snyder, Section 16).<ref name=snyder/> The rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]].\n\n===Authalic latitude===\n{{see also|Authalic radius}}\nThe '''authalic''' (Greek for [[wiktionary:authalic|same area]]) latitude, {{mvar|\u03be}}, gives an area-preserving transformation to a sphere.\n:<math>\\xi(\\phi) = \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\frac{q(\\phi)}{q_\\mathrm{p}}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  q(\\phi) &= \\frac{\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\sin\\phi}{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi} -\n               \\frac{1 - e^2}{2e}\\ln \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right) \\\\[2pt]\n          &= \\frac{\\left(1 - e^2\\right)\\sin\\phi}{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\phi} + \\frac{1 - e^2}{e}\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  q_\\mathrm{p} = q\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n    &= 1 - \\frac{1 - e^2}{2e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - e}{1 + e}\\right) \\\\\n    &= 1 + \\frac{1 - e^2}{e}\\tanh^{-1}e\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand the radius of the sphere is taken as\n:<math>R_q = a\\sqrt{\\frac{q_\\mathrm{p}}{2}}\\,.</math>\n\nAn example of the use of the authalic latitude is the [[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]].<ref name=snyder/>{{rp|\u00a714}}\n\n===Conformal latitude===\nThe '''conformal latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c7}}, gives an angle-preserving ([[Conformal map|conformal]]) transformation to the sphere.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\chi(\\phi) &= 2\\tan^{-1}\\left[\n    \\left(\\frac{1 +  \\sin\\phi}{1 -  \\sin\\phi}\\right)\n    \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right)^e\\right\n  ]^\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\[2pt]\n             &= 2\\tan^{-1}\\left[\n                  \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)\n                  \\left(\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right)^\\frac{e}{2}\n                \\right] - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\\\[2pt]\n             &= \\tan^{-1}\\left[\\sinh\\left(\\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) - e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\\right)\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}\\left[\\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi) - e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi)\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|gd(''x'')}} is the [[Gudermannian function]]. (See also [[Mercator projection#Alternative expressions|Mercator projection]].)\n\nThe conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of ''arbitrary'' radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of ''small'' elements is well preserved). A further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the [[Transverse Mercator projection]] on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).\n\n===Isometric latitude===\nThe '''isometric latitude''', {{mvar|\u03c8}}, is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal [[Mercator projection]] and the [[Transverse Mercator projection]]. The name \"isometric\" arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of {{mvar|\u03c8}} and longitude {{mvar|\u03bb}} give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] defined by the lines of constant {{mvar|\u03c8}} and constant {{mvar|\u03bb}}, divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15):<ref name=snyder/>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\psi(\\phi) &= \\ln\\left[\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)\\right] +\n                  \\frac{e}{2}\\ln\\left[\\frac{1 - e\\sin\\phi}{1 + e\\sin\\phi}\\right] \\\\\n             &= \\sinh^{-1}(\\tan\\phi) -e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi) \\\\\n             &= \\operatorname{gd}^{-1}(\\phi)-e\\tanh^{-1}(e\\sin\\phi).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nFor the ''normal'' Mercator projection (on the ellipsoid) this function defines the spacing of the parallels: if the length of the equator on the projection is {{mvar|E}} (units of length or pixels) then the distance, {{mvar|y}}, of a parallel of latitude {{mvar|\u03c6}} from the equator is\n:<math>y(\\phi) = \\frac{E}{2\\pi}\\psi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\nThe isometric latitude {{mvar|\u03c8}} is closely related to the conformal latitude {{mvar|\u03c7}}:\n:<math>\\psi(\\phi) = \\operatorname{gd}^{-1} \\chi(\\phi)\\,.</math>\n\n===Inverse formulae and series===\nThe formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and parametric latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are [[fixed-point iteration]] and [[Newton's method|Newton\u2013Raphson]] root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of [[Lagrange reversion]]. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity.<ref name=adams1921/> Osborne<ref name=osborne/> derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ |title=Maxima computer algebra system |website=[[Sourceforge]]}}</ref> and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.\n\n===Numerical comparison of auxiliary latitudes===\n[[File:Auxiliary Latitudes Difference.svg|inline|right]]\nThe plot to the right shows the difference between the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude (which diverges to infinity at the poles) for the case of the WGS84 ellipsoid.

To define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions. Three latitudes are used in this way: the geodetic, geocentric and parametric latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates, spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectively.\n\n===Geodetic coordinates===\n[[File:Geodetic coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}}]]\nAt an arbitrary point {{math|P}} consider the line {{math|PN}} which is normal to the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic coordinates {{math|P(''\u0278'',''\u03bb'',''h'')}} are the latitude and longitude of the point {{math|N}} on the ellipsoid and the distance {{math|PN}}. This height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location. The direction of {{math|PN}} will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line. The relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the Earth.\n\n===Spherical polar coordinates===\n\n[[File:Geocentric coords 02.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9| Geocentric coordinate related to spherical polar coordinates {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe geocentric latitude {{mvar|\u03b8}} is the complement of the polar angle {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} in conventional [[spherical polar coordinates]] in which the coordinates of a point are {{math|P(''r'',''\u03b8''\u2032,''\u03bb'')}} where {{mvar|r}} is the distance of {{math|P}} from the centre {{math|O}}, {{mvar|\u03b8\u2032}} is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and {{mvar|\u03bb}} is longitude. Since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points {{math|P'}} on the normal, which all have the same geodetic latitude, will have differing geocentric latitudes. Spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity field.\n\n===Ellipsoidal coordinates===\n[[File:Ellipsoidal coordinates.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ellipsoidal coordinates {{math|P(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}}]]\nThe parametric latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system. For a point {{math|P}} not on the reference ellipsoid (semi-axes {{math|OA}} and {{math|OB}}) construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal (same foci {{math|F}}, {{math|F\u2032}}) with the reference ellipsoid: the necessary condition is that the product {{mvar|ae}} of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids. Let {{mvar|u}} be the semi-minor axis ({{math|OD}}) of the auxiliary ellipsoid. Further let {{mvar|\u03b2}} be the parametric latitude of {{math|P}} on the auxiliary ellipsoid. The set {{math|(''u'',''\u03b2'',''\u03bb'')}} define the ellipsoid coordinates.<ref name=torge/>{{rp|\u00a74.2.2}} These coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a rotating ellipsoidal body.\n\n===Coordinate conversions===\nThe relations between the above coordinate systems, and also Cartesian coordinates are not presented here. The transformation between geodetic and Cartesian coordinates may be found in [[Geographic coordinate conversion]]. The relation of Cartesian and spherical polars is given in [[Spherical coordinate system]]. The relation of Cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in Torge.<ref name=torge/>\n\n==Astronomical latitude==\n'''Astronomical latitude''' ({{math|\u03a6}}) is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface. The true vertical, the direction of a [[plumb line]], is also the direction of the gravity acceleration, the resultant of the [[gravitational acceleration]] (mass-based) and the [[centrifugal acceleration]] at that latitude.<ref name=torge/> Astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the [[zenith]] and stars whose [[declination]] is accurately known.\n\nIn general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid. The angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy.<ref name=torge/><ref name=wellenhofmoritz>{{cite book|last1=Hofmann-Wellenhof |first1=B. |last2=Moritz |first2=H. |date=2006 |title=Physical Geodesy |edition=2nd |isbn=3-211-33544-7}}</ref> The reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is, because the geoid is an idealized, theoretical shape \"at mean sea level\". Points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly. Also, the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces, which the theoretical geoid averages out.\n\nAstronomical latitude is not to be confused with [[declination]], the coordinate [[astronomer]]s use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[celestial equator]] (see [[equatorial coordinates]]), nor with [[ecliptic latitude]], the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars north/south of the [[ecliptic]] (see [[ecliptic coordinates]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Altitude]] ([[sea level|mean sea level]])\n*[[Bowditch's American Practical Navigator]]\n*[[Cardinal direction]]\n*[[Circle of latitude]]\n*[[Declination]] on [[celestial sphere]]\n*[[Degree Confluence Project]]\n*[[Geodesy]]\n*[[Geodetic datum]]\n*[[Geographic coordinate system]]\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Geotagging]]\n*[[Great-circle distance]]\n*[[History of latitude measurements]]\n*[[Horse latitudes]]\n*[[List of countries by latitude]]\n*[[Longitude]]\n*[[Natural Area Code]]\n*[[Navigation]]\n*[[Orders of magnitude (length)]]\n*[[World Geodetic System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Noteslist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks}}\n*[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ GEONets Names Server], access to the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]'s (NGA) database of foreign geographic feature names.\n*[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~cvm/latlon_find_location.html Resources for determining your latitude and longitude]\n*[http://geography.about.com/library/howto/htdegrees.htm Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds] - Info about decimal to [[sexagesimal]] conversion\n*[http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/DDDMMSS-decimal.html Convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, seconds]\n*[http://www.marinewaypoints.com/learn/greatcircle.shtml Distance calculation based on latitude and longitude] - JavaScript version\n*[https://www.academia.edu/12297694/16th_Century_Latitude_Survey 16th Century Latitude Survey]\n*[http://www.longcamp.com/nav.html Determination of Latitude by Francis Drake on the Coast of California in 1579]\n\n\n{{geographical coordinates|state=collapsed}}\n{{Map projection}}\n\n[[Category:Lines of latitude| ]]\n[[Category:Geodesy]]\n[[Category:Navigation]]\n", "name_user": "Lakun.patra", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: north/south \u2192 north\u2013south (2), However  \u2192 However, , east-west \u2192 east\u2013west", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"}

In 1930, all sections ([[Tachikawa Station|Tachikawa]] - [[Haijima Station|Haijima]] - [[Musashi-Itsukaichi Station|Musashi-Itsukaichi]] - Musashi-Iwai) were opened. There were two competing railways between Tachikawa and Haijima: the \u014cme Electric Railway (now the [[\u014cme Line]]) and the Itsukaichi Railway. In 1940, the Itsukaichi Railway was taken over by the Nambu Railway, becoming the Nambu Railway Itsukaichi Line. In 1944, Nambu Railway was nationalized and this line became the [[Japanese Government Railways|JGR]] Itsukaichi Line. At the same time, the section of the line between Tachikawa and Haijima was deemed non-essential and closed. However, the Tachikawa - Musashi-Uenohara and Musahi-Uenohara - [[Nishi-Tachikawa Station|Nishi-Tachikawa]] sections of the former Nambu Railway are still used by [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line]] and [[Nambu Line]] trains traveling to and from the southern area of Tachikawa Station.\n\n===Chronology===\n*24 April 1925: Itsukaichi Railway opens between Haijima (temporary) and Itsukaichi (6.6&nbsp;mi, 10.62&nbsp;km) stations.
