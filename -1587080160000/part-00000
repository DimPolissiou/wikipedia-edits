After meeting [[Rekeson]] in a nightclub and doing a freestyle with him, they decided to form a rap duo, and that's where [[Guerrilla Seca]] (GCK) was born. In those times; approximately in the year 1995, rap was very underground, sounding only \"La Corte.\" Rekeson and Prieto Beretta (then known as Colombia), were dedicated to improvise in the streets, where they caught the attention of Juan Carlos Echendia, who hired them for Subterr\u00e1neo Records, where they made their first record with other underground rap groups, called [[Venezuela Subterr\u00e1nea]].\n\nAfter three years, they decided to release another record, and from the hand of Subterr\u00e1neo Records the second (First solo) disc of Guerrilla Seca was born, which they called \"La Realidad M\u00e1s Real\" (The Most Real Reality), it was quite famous, making them known practically in all of Venezuela, and urging rap to be populaized.\n\nIn 2006, three years after the success of The Most Real Reality, El Prieto and Rekeson had some personal problems and decided to release two albums alone, but at the same time and under the name of GCK so as not to damage the duo. This is how \"Yo contra el mundo\" (Me Against the World) and \"Jugando Vivo\" (Playing Live) were bon.

The album was very accepted by the fans, but its success did not last long because one year later El Prieto and Rekeson had differences again, which caused them to separate definitively and culminate with the Guerrilla Seca project, leaving many fans disappointed.

She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California.\n\n\n\n==Life==\n===Early Life===\nNoskowiak was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography.<ref name=\"Darsie2002\">{{cite book|author=Darsie Alexander|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=149}}</ref> In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915. In 1919, she moved to San Francisco to enroll in secretarial school.<ref name=\"Marnie1979\">{{cite book|author=Marnie Gillett|title=Sonya Noskowiak|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=1979|pages=4}}</ref>  Interested in photography at an early age, in 1925, Noskowiak would become a receptionist in [[Johan Hagemeyer]]'s photographic studio in Los Angeles County. Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. \n\n===Becoming a Photographer===\nIn early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer [[Edward Weston]] at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos--touching up flaws in prints--before he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved, were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives.[[File:Red Cabbage Halved.jpg|thumb|Edward Weston, Artichoke Halved, 1930]] Weston even once stated: \"Any of these I would sign as my own.\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in-law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\"<ref name=\"Hagemeyer1933\">{{cite journal|first=Dora|last=Hagemeyer|date=8 September 1933|title=Noskowiak Exhibit Important to Art|journal=Carmel Pine Cone|page=4}}</ref>\n==Photography==\n===Group F.64===\nPhotography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by [[pictorialism]], a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'. This was in response to claims that photography was not an art but merely scientific documentation.<ref name=\"Karlstrom1996\"> {{cite book|author=Paul J Karlstrom|title= On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art|publisher= University of California Press |year=1996|pages=246 }}</ref> Weston and other photographers began to turn away from pictorialism, with many having growing concerns about their place in photography.  In 1932 Noskowiak became an organizing member of the short-lived [[Group f/64]], which included such important photographers as [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], Weston and his son [[Brett Weston|Brett]].  Noskowiak's works were shown at Group f/64's inaugural exhibition at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum; she had nine photographs in the exhibit \u2013 the same number as Weston.[5] .<ref name=\"Therese1992\">{{cite book|author=Therese Thau Heyman|title=Seeing Straight: The f.64 Revolution in Photography|publisher=Oakland Museum |year=1992|pages=67 }}</ref>\n===Early Success===\nIn the summer of 1933, Noskowiak, along with Weston and Van Dyke, traveled to New Mexico for scenery shots. Her photographs Cottonwood Tree - Taos, New Mexico, and Ovens, Taos Pueblo, New Mexico both are from this trip and differ from her previous work. Cottonwood Tree is not nearly as intimate as her other works while Ovens is the earliest of her work to focus on human-made culture. [[File:Ovens.jpg|thumb|Sonya Noskowiak, Ovens, Taos Pueblo, New Mexico, 1933]]  Later that summer, she had her first solo show at Denny-Watrous Gallery in Carmel. The exhibition included a series of photographs from New Mexico. She held another solo exhibition at 683 Brockhurst in November.  Between 1933 and 1940, she participated in a few of Group f.64 exhibitions, including shows such as the Fine Arts Gallery in San Diego, Fresno State College, and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. \n===Group F.64 dissolvement===\nNoskowiak and Weston broke up in 1935, Group f. 64 disbanded shortly thereafter. Perhaps, due to her frayed relationship with Weston and perhaps because other members of the group were going their separate ways.<ref name=\"Donna1979\">{{cite book|author=Donna Bender|title=Sonya Noskowiak Archive, Guide Series 5|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=1979|pages=5}}</ref> Although writings from Noskowiak began to dwindle during this time her career did not. Noskowiak also moved to San Francisco and opened a portrait studio this same year.  This same year Noskowiak moved to San Francisco to open a portrait studio on Union Street. In 1936, she was one of eight photographers, including Weston, selected for the California region of the [[Federal Art Project]] to document California during the Great Depression\n===Commercial Work===\nNoskowiak also engaged in commercial work and commissions to make a living. After Groupf.64 dissolved, she spent the next year photographing California artists and their paintings, sculptures, and murals. These images then toured to a variety of public institutions. Though she continued to photograph as an artist, Noskowiak's livelihood from the 1940s on was based on portraiture, fashion and architectural images.

She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California.\n\n\n\n==Life==\n===Early Life===\nNoskowiak was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography.<ref name=\"Darsie2002\">{{cite book|author=Darsie Alexander|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=149}}</ref> In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915. In 1919, she moved to San Francisco to enroll in secretarial school.<ref name=\"Marnie1979\">{{cite book|author=Marnie Gillett|title=Sonya Noskowiak|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=1979|pages=4}}</ref>  Interested in photography at an early age, in 1925, Noskowiak would become a receptionist in [[Johan Hagemeyer]]'s photographic studio in Los Angeles County. Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. \n\n===Becoming a Photographer===\nIn early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer [[Edward Weston]] at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos--touching up flaws in prints--before he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved [[File:Red Cabbage Halved.jpg|thumb|Edward Weston, Artichoke Halved, 1930]], were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives. Weston even once stated: \"Any of these I would sign as my own.\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in-law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\"<ref name=\"Hagemeyer1933\">{{cite journal|first=Dora|last=Hagemeyer|date=8 September 1933|title=Noskowiak Exhibit Important to Art|journal=Carmel Pine Cone|page=4}}</ref>\n==Photography==\n===Group F.64===\nPhotography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by [[pictorialism]], a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'. This was in response to claims that photography was not an art but merely scientific documentation.<ref name=\"Karlstrom1996\"> {{cite book|author=Paul J Karlstrom|title= On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art|publisher= University of California Press |year=1996|pages=246 }}</ref> Weston and other photographers began to turn away from pictorialism, with many having growing concerns about their place in photography.  In 1932 Noskowiak became an organizing member of the short-lived [[Group f/64]], which included such important photographers as [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], Weston and his son [[Brett Weston|Brett]].  Noskowiak's works were shown at Group f/64's inaugural exhibition at San Francisco's M. H. de Young Museum; she had nine photographs in the exhibit \u2013 the same number as Weston.[5] .<ref name=\"Therese1992\">{{cite book|author=Therese Thau Heyman|title=Seeing Straight: The f.64 Revolution in Photography|publisher=Oakland Museum |year=1992|pages=67 }}</ref>\n===Early Success===\nIn the summer of 1933, Noskowiak, along with Weston and Van Dyke, traveled to New Mexico for scenery shots. Her photographs Cottonwood Tree - Taos, New Mexico, and Ovens, Taos Pueblo, New Mexico both are from this trip and differ from her previous work. Cottonwood Tree is not nearly as intimate as her other works while Ovens is the earliest of her work to focus on human-made culture. [[File:Ovens.jpg|thumb|Sonya Noskowiak, Ovens, Taos Pueblo, New Mexico, 1933]]  Later that summer, she had her first solo show at Denny-Watrous Gallery in Carmel. The exhibition included a series of photographs from New Mexico. She held another solo exhibition at 683 Brockhurst in November.  Between 1933 and 1940, she participated in a few of Group f.64 exhibitions, including shows such as the Fine Arts Gallery in San Diego, Fresno State College, and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. \n===Group F.64 dissolvement===\nNoskowiak and Weston broke up in 1935, Group f. 64 disbanded shortly thereafter. Perhaps, due to her frayed relationship with Weston and perhaps because other members of the group were going their separate ways.<ref name=\"Donna1979\">{{cite book|author=Donna Bender|title=Sonya Noskowiak Archive, Guide Series 5|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=1979|pages=5}}</ref> Although writings from Noskowiak began to dwindle during this time her career did not. Noskowiak also moved to San Francisco and opened a portrait studio this same year.  This same year Noskowiak moved to San Francisco to open a portrait studio on Union Street. In 1936, she was one of eight photographers, including Weston, selected for the California region of the [[Federal Art Project]] to document California during the Great Depression\n===Commercial Work===\nNoskowiak also engaged in commercial work and commissions to make a living. After Groupf.64 dissolved, she spent the next year photographing California artists and their paintings, sculptures, and murals. These images then toured to a variety of public institutions.

The center is [[Gusinje]]. The municipality is located in northeastern region of Montenegro. Gusinje Municipality was created in 2014, when it was split from [[Plav Municipality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223123018/http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |archivedate=2014-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nGusinje and neighbouring [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] are part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range. Its settlements stands at an elevation of about 1,000m. They are surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Montenegro. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro is located in the National Park \"Prokletije\" about 10km south of the town itself.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> [[Visitor (mountain)|Mount Visitor]] overlooks Gusinje and Plav. At the mountain's foothills stands the village of [[Martinaj]].\n\nGusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center near the village of [[Vusanje]] (Vuthaj). The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. \n\nThe town of Gusinje is the seat of the municipality. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. It covers 157 km\u00b2, 1.1% of the total area of Montenegro.<ref name=\"opstina5\">{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}}</ref> Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding. The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated to the north of [[Lake Plav]].{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics.

The center is [[Gusinje]]. The municipality is located in northeastern region of Montenegro. Gusinje Municipality was created in 2014, when it was split from [[Plav Municipality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223123018/http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |archivedate=2014-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nGusinje and neighbouring [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] are part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range. Its settlements stands at an elevation of about 1,000m. They are surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Montenegro. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro is located in the National Park \"Prokletije\" about 10km south of the town itself.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> [[Visitor (mountain)|Mount Visitor]] overlooks Gusinje and Plav. At the mountain's foothills stands the village of [[Martinaj]].\n\nGusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center near the village of [[Vusanje]] (Vuthaj). The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. \n\nThe town of Gusinje is the seat of the municipality. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. It covers 157 km\u00b2, 1.1% of the total area of Montenegro.<ref name=\"opstina5\">{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}}</ref> Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding. The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated to the north of [[Lake Plav]].{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics. They form the only Catholic community in Gusinje.\n\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Historical demography of Gusinje Municipality{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}}\n|-\n!
