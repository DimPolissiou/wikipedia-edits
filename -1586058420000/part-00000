{"title_page": "Captain general", "text_new": "{{short description|Military grade}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n'''Captain general''' (and its literal equivalent in several languages) is a high [[military rank]] of [[general officer]] grade, and a [[Governor|gubernatorial]] title.\n\n==History==\nThe term \"Captain General\" started to appear in the 14th century, with the meaning of [[Commander in Chief]] of an army (or fleet) in the field, probably the first usage of the term [[General]] in military settings. A popular term in the 16th and 17th centuries, but with various meanings depending on the country, it became less and less used in the 18th century, usually replaced with, simply, [[General]] or [[Field Marshal]]; and after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] it had all but disappeared in most European countries, except Spain and former colonies. See also ''[[Feldhauptmann]]'' (\"field captain\"). Other ranks of general officer, as distinct from [[field officer]], had the suffix \"general\"; e.g. [[major general]], [[lieutenant general]], [[brigadier general]], [[colonel general]].\n\n=== Republic of Venice ===\nIn the [[Republic of Venice]], it meant the commander in chief in war time. The captain general of the land forces was usually a foreign mercenary or [[condottiere]], but the [[Venetian navy]] was always entrusted to a member of the city's patriciate, who became [[Captain general of the Sea]]. It is at least documented since 1370 and was used up to the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]] in 1797.\n\n=== Great Britain ===\nFrom 30 June to 22 October 1513, [[Catherine of Aragon]] held the titles Governor of the Realm and Captain General of the King's Forces as [[regent|Queen Regent]] of [[England]], {{failed verification|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Tudors/catherine_aragon_timeline.htm|title=The Tudors - Catherine of Aragon Timeline - History|date=4 December 2013|website=historyonthenet.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126103655/http://www.historyonthenet.com/tudors/catherine_aragon_timeline.htm|archivedate=26 January 2017}}</ref> winning the [[Battle of Flodden]] against a Scottish invasion while [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was in France fighting the [[Battle of the Spurs]]. \n\n==== Commander-in-Chief of the Forces====\nIn the mid-17th century, with the first establishment in England of something akin to a [[standing army]], the title Captain General was used (either alongside or in place of that of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces]]) to signify its commanding officer.

Thereafter there was no permanent Commander-in-Chief or equivalent appointed until 1744; the following year the office of Captain General was vested in [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]]. Cumberland resigned in 1757; his successors in command were for the most part appointed Commander-in-Chief but not Captain General, with one exception: the last appointment of a Captain General of the Forces was that of [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick, the Duke of York]] in 1799.<ref name=Roper1998/>\n\nAny distinction that there may have been at this time between the office of 'Captain General' and 'Commander-in-Chief' is unclear.

This was a \"confederal\" office, under the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. He was also [[stadtholder]] of five of the seven provinces, which was a ''provincial'' appointive office, under the sovereign States of the several provinces. Maurice's nephew [[William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]] was concurrently also a stadtholder (in two provinces) but he held a normal commission in the States Army. The office was not hereditary, but after 1747 only members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] could be ''appointed'' to it.\n\n=== Spain ===\n\nBy the late 15th century Captain General was, besides the usual meaning of commander-in-chief in the field, also linked to the highest commander of specialized military branches (artillery, royal guards, etc.), usually signaling the independence of that particular corps.\n\nNo later than the fall of [[Granada]] (1492) the title was conferred also on officers with full jurisdiction of every person subject to ''fuero militar'' (military obligations) in a region. Those officers usually also acted as commanders for the troops and military establishments in their area and, as time passed, those duties (and the title) were mostly united in the highest civilian authority of the area. During the period of Spanish rule in much of [[Latin America]] there were several [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire]]. The military post of ''captain general'' as highest territorial commander lasted in Spain until the early 1980s.\n\n==== Army ====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Army}}\nIn the late 17th or very early 18th century, a personal rank of ''captain general'' was created in the [[Spanish Army]] (and Navy) as the highest rank in the hierarchy, not unlike the [[Marechal de France]]. When wearing uniform, the kings used captain general insignia. [[Valeriano Weyler]], [[Governor-General|Governor General]] of [[Cuba]] in 1896\u201397 during the period preceding the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], held the rank. Briefly abolished by the [[Second Spanish Republic]], it was restored during the regime of [[Francisco Franco]] in 1938; Franco himself was the only officer of this rank.<ref name=fnff>{{cite news |url=https://fnff.es/actualidad/201496330/la-corona-y-la-dictadura-totalitaria-de-franco.html |title=La Corona y la 'dictadura totalitaria' de Franco |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=30 June 2019 |work=Fundaci\u00f3n Nacional Francisco Franco |language=es}}</ref> Later King [[Juan Carlos I]] (1975), [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]] (1956) and [[Camilo Alonso Vega]] (1972) were promoted while on active duty; a few posthumous promotions and promotions of retired officers to this rank were also made. In 1999, the rank was reserved to the reigning [[Spanish Monarchy|monarch]].\n\n==== Navy ====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Navy}}\nThe evolution of the title in the [[Spanish Navy]] is parallel to that of the army. During the 16th and 17th century the two main naval captain general posts were ''Capit\u00e1n-General de la Armada de la Mar Oceana'' and  ''Capit\u00e1n-General de Galeras'', roughly [[Commander in Chief|CIC]] for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean respectively.\n\nA peculiar usage of the rank arose in the Spanish Navy of the 16th century. A ''capit\u00e1n-general'' was appointed by the king as the leader of a fleet (although the term 'squadron' is more appropriate, as most galleon fleets rarely consisted of more than a dozen vessels, not counting escorted merchantmen), with full jurisdictional powers. The fleet [[second-in-command]] was the 'almirante' (admiral), an officer appointed by the capitan-general and responsible for the seaworthiness of the squadron.<ref>\"Spanish Galleon: 1530\u20131690\" by Angus Konstam, copyright 2004 [[Osprey Publishing]], Ltd.</ref> One captain-general that sailed under the Spanish flag that is now well known was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], leader of the first fleet to sail around the world.\n\nUnder the Nationalist regime of 1939\u20131975, the only holder of the rank of ''capit\u00e1n general de la armada'' was the [[Caudillo]], [[General\u00edsimo]] [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=fnff/>\n\n====Air force====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Air Force}}\nThe rank of Captain General of the [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]], originally created by Franco for himself, currently is reserved for the reigning monarch.<ref name=fnff/>\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\n==== Army ====\n\nThe title was given, in 1508, to the commander-in-chief of the ''[[Ordenan\u00e7as]]'' (the territorial army of the crown).\n\nDuring the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], after 1640, the \"Captain-General of the Arms of the Kingdom\", became the commander-in-chief of the [[Portuguese Army]], under the direct authority of the War Council and the King. In 1762 the post of the captain-general was replaced by the title ''marechal-general'' \u2013 [[Fieldmarshall|fieldmarshall-general]].\n\n==== Navy ====\nLike in the Army, the ''Capit\u00e3o-General da Armada Real'' (Captain-General of the Royal Navy) was the commander-in-chief of the [[Portuguese Navy]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n=== France ===\nThe title has been only sporadically used in France. During the 17th century, and for a short while, a rank between [[Lieutenant General]] and [[Marshal of France]] of this denomination was created. The king of France was the Captain [[General of the Army]], but was represented in the field by lieutenant generals who commanded in his absence.\n\n=== Kingdom of Bavaria ===\nIn the former [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the ''generalkapit\u00e4n'' was the leader of the royal [[Hartschier]] guard. The position was associated with the highest class ranking in the ''Hofrangordnung'' (court order of precedence).<ref>[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905//AHofrangordnung ''''Hofrangordnung] (German) Meyers Gro\u00dfes Konversations-Lexikon.</ref>\n\n=== Papal States ===\nDuring the time of the [[Papal States]] the title of [[Captain General of the Church]] was given to the de facto commander-in-chief of the Papal Army.  It existed parallel to the office of [[Gonfalonier of the Church]], which was a more ceremonial position than a tactical military command position.  Both offices were abolished by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and replaced with the office of [[Flag-bearer of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\n===Czechia, Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine===\nThe term \"Captain General\" as [[Hetman]] (the word from the German [[Hauptmann]] \"Capitan\") is a political title from Eastern Europe, historically assigned to military commanders. It was the title of the second-highest military commander (after the monarch) in 15th- to 18th and 20th-century.\n\n=== Siam ===\nThe rank Captain General ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48}}) was used as the highest rank in [[Wild Tiger Corps]], this rank was exclusively for King [[Vajiravudh]] but in 1915 he created rank General of the Wild Tiger Corps ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}) for members who are leaders of corps. The rank was equivalent to Brigadier.\n\n==Current usage as a military rank and dignity==\n\n===Bolivia===\nIn [[Bolivia]], the head of state for the duration of his tenure has the rank and dignity of Captain General as head of the Armed forces, despite being a civilian.\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\nIn the armies of various [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the term ''Captain General'' (Captain-General in Canada) is used generally when describing the ceremonial head of a corps or unit. As such, [[Elizabeth II]], the monarch of each of the realms, is the Captain General of the British [[Royal Artillery]] and the [[Honourable Artillery Company]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39509&geotype=London&gpn=1941 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39864&geotype=London&gpn=2995 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Royal Australian Artillery]], and [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]] and [[Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps]].<ref name=LG39866>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39866&geotype=London&gpn=3003 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Prince Harry]] is currently the [[Captain General Royal Marines]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/december/19/171219-prince-harry-succeeds-the-duke-of-edinburgh-as-captain-general-royal-marines |title=Prince Harry succeeds the Duke of Edinburgh as Captain General Royal Marines |work=[[British Royal Navy]] website |date=19 December 2017 |access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne other appointment of Captain General is in the [[Royal Company of Archers]] (The Queen\u2019s Body Guard for Scotland), a position currently held by [[David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie|the Earl of Airlie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5009.asp |title=Royal Company of Archers |work=Official Website of the [[British Monarchy]] |access-date=6 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929230359/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5009.asp |archive-date=29 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Chile===\nIf the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Head of State are reunited in the same person, they are promoted to the permanent military rank of ''Captain General''. It has only happened three times in Chile's history ([[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Ramon Freire]] and [[Augusto Pinochet Ugarte]]). Current electoral provisions (as of 2008) forbid the Commander-in-Chief becoming President.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Captain general (Spain)}}\nIn Spain, the title Captain General (''capit\u00e1n general'') is the highest military rank, and has since 1999 been exclusively borne by the [[Spanish monarch]] (currently [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]]). Assimilated to a [[NATO]] OF-11 rank (OF-01 until that year).\n\n==Administrative positions==\n{{Main|Captaincy}}\n\nThe term \"captain general\" can also be used to translate Spanish ''capit\u00e1n general'' or Portuguese ''capit\u00e3o-general'', administrative titles used in the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the [[Americas]]. Each was in charge of a [[captaincy]].\n\n===In the Spanish Empire and Latin America===\n''Capit\u00e1n General'' was the military title given to the [[Spain|Spanish]] military governor of a province of the [[Spanish Empire]], in the colonies usually also the president of the civilian [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]] (court of law).\n\n===In the Portuguese Empire===\nIn the Portuguese Empire, a ''capit\u00e3o-general'' (plural ''capit\u00e3es-generais'') was a governor of a ''capitania geral'' ([[captaincy general]]), with a higher rank than a ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' ([[captain-major]]) and directly subordinated to the Crown. A captaincy general had a higher category than the simple [[Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire|captaincies]] (also referred as subaltern captaincies). Sometimes, a captaincy general included one or more subaltern captaincies. The governors of the captaincies general were usually styled \"governor and captain-general\", with the term \"governor\" referring to his administrative role and the term \"captain-general\" referring to his military role as commander-in-chief of the troops in his captaincy.\n\nThe title ''capit\u00e3o-general'' was also associated to the roles of Governor-General or Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]] and of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. Thus, in Brazil, besides the captains-generals that were governors of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|several captaincies general]], existed a central captain-general that was the governor-general or Viceroy.\n\n==In fiction==\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Boromir]] is considered to be a captain general of [[Gondor]].\n\nIn the [[The Wheel of Time|Wheel of Time]] series by [[Robert Jordan]], \"captain-general\"  is the highest rank of the Ever Victorious Army of [[Seanchan]], excepting only the rank of ''marshal-general'', which may be temporarily assigned to a captain-general given the command of a [[theatre of war]]. In addition, captain-general is also the title of both the leader of the Queen's Guard of Andor and the head of the Green [[Ajah (Wheel of Time)|Ajah]] of the [[Aes Sedai]].\n\nIn the ''[[BattleTech]]'' universe, captain-general is the title of the military and political leader of the [[Free Worlds League]]. Since the 25th century, captain-generals have been members of the Marik family.\n\nIn ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'', [[Cesare Borgia]] is depicted in the office of [[Captain General of the Church|Captain General of the Papal Army]], a position he did in fact hold along with [[Gonfalonier of the Church]].\n\nIn the ''[[Ring of Fire (series)|Ring of Fire]]'' universe (created by [[Eric Flint]]), Gustav II Adolf, King of Sweden, is granted the newly created hereditary title of \"Captain General of the State of Thuringia\" (later known as the State of Thuringia-Franconia) at the end of the first book, entitled '1632'. This was a recognition of his authority over Thuringian territory as an integral part of the \"Confederated Principalities of Europe\", a Protestant substitute for the Holy Roman Empire which he created, while allowing the Thuringian government to continue to claim that it was a republic and not a monarchy.\n\nIn the [[Warhammer 40,000]] universe, the title Captain-General of the Adeptus Custodes is given to the head of the Adeptus Custodes, the elite 10,000 [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|genetically engineered]] supersoldiers who acted as the God-Emperor of Mankind's elite bodyguard, joining him in battle during the Great Crusade and [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]]. During the Horus Heresy, the Captain-General was Constantin Valdor, called the \"Emperor's Spear\". In the aftermath, the Captain-General was granted a position as a [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|High Lord of Terra]] and ultimate authority over who could approach the Golden Throne, where the Emperor was interred after his battle with the Warmaster Horus.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonel-in-Chief]]\n* [[Captain-major]]\n* [[Captaincy]], an administrative division in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires, governed by a captain general.\n* [[Five-star rank]]\n* [[General]], a description of the various general officer ranks, including the full general which is the successor to captain general\n* [[General Captaincy]]\n* [[List of senior officers of the British Army]]\n* [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Honorary military positions|Queen Elizabeth II's honorary military positions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Gubernatorial titles]]\n[[Category:Military ranks]]\n[[Category:Military history of Spain]]\n[[Category:Portuguese colonization of the Americas]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Military grade}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n'''Captain general''' (and its literal equivalent in several languages) is a high [[military rank]] of [[general officer]] grade, and a [[Governor|gubernatorial]] title.\n\n==History==\nThe term \"Captain General\" started to appear in the 14th century, with the meaning of [[Commander in Chief]] of an army (or fleet) in the field, probably the first usage of the term [[General]] in military settings.

Thereafter there was no permanent Commander-in-Chief or equivalent appointed until 1744; the following year the office of Captain General was vested in [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]]. Cumberland resigned in 1757; his successors in command were for the most part appointed Commander-in-Chief but not Captain General, with one exception: the last appointment of a Captain General of the Forces was that of [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick, the Duke of York]] in 1799.<ref name=Roper1998/>\n\nAny distinction that there may have been at this time between the office of 'Captain General' and 'Commander-in-Chief' is unclear.

This was a \"confederal\" office, under the [[States General of the Netherlands]]. He was also [[stadtholder]] of five of the seven provinces, which was a ''provincial'' appointive office, under the sovereign States of the several provinces. Maurice's nephew [[William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg]] was concurrently also a stadtholder (in two provinces) but he held a normal commission in the States Army. The office was not hereditary, but after 1747 only members of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]] could be ''appointed'' to it.\n\n=== Spain ===\n\nBy the late 15th century Captain General was, besides the usual meaning of commander-in-chief in the field, also linked to the highest commander of specialized military branches (artillery, royal guards, etc.), usually signaling the independence of that particular corps.\n\nNo later than the fall of [[Granada]] (1492) the title was conferred also on officers with full jurisdiction of every person subject to ''fuero militar'' (military obligations) in a region. Those officers usually also acted as commanders for the troops and military establishments in their area and, as time passed, those duties (and the title) were mostly united in the highest civilian authority of the area. During the period of Spanish rule in much of [[Latin America]] there were several [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire]]. The military post of ''captain general'' as highest territorial commander lasted in Spain until the early 1980s.\n\n==== Army ====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Army}}\nIn the late 17th or very early 18th century, a personal rank of ''captain general'' was created in the [[Spanish Army]] (and Navy) as the highest rank in the hierarchy, not unlike the [[Marechal de France]]. When wearing uniform, the kings used captain general insignia. [[Valeriano Weyler]], [[Governor-General|Governor General]] of [[Cuba]] in 1896\u201397 during the period preceding the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], held the rank. Briefly abolished by the [[Second Spanish Republic]], it was restored during the regime of [[Francisco Franco]] in 1938; Franco himself was the only officer of this rank.<ref name=fnff>{{cite news |url=https://fnff.es/actualidad/201496330/la-corona-y-la-dictadura-totalitaria-de-franco.html |title=La Corona y la 'dictadura totalitaria' de Franco |date=6 November 2012 |access-date=30 June 2019 |work=Fundaci\u00f3n Nacional Francisco Franco |language=es}}</ref> Later King [[Juan Carlos I]] (1975), [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]] (1956) and [[Camilo Alonso Vega]] (1972) were promoted while on active duty; a few posthumous promotions and promotions of retired officers to this rank were also made. In 1999, the rank was reserved to the reigning [[Spanish Monarchy|monarch]].\n\n==== Navy ====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Navy}}\nThe evolution of the title in the [[Spanish Navy]] is parallel to that of the army. During the 16th and 17th century the two main naval captain general posts were ''Capit\u00e1n-General de la Armada de la Mar Oceana'' and  ''Capit\u00e1n-General de Galeras'', roughly [[Commander in Chief|CIC]] for the Atlantic and the Mediterranean respectively.\n\nA peculiar usage of the rank arose in the Spanish Navy of the 16th century. A ''capit\u00e1n-general'' was appointed by the king as the leader of a fleet (although the term 'squadron' is more appropriate, as most galleon fleets rarely consisted of more than a dozen vessels, not counting escorted merchantmen), with full jurisdictional powers. The fleet [[second-in-command]] was the 'almirante' (admiral), an officer appointed by the capitan-general and responsible for the seaworthiness of the squadron.<ref>\"Spanish Galleon: 1530\u20131690\" by Angus Konstam, copyright 2004 [[Osprey Publishing]], Ltd.</ref> One captain-general that sailed under the Spanish flag that is now well known was [[Ferdinand Magellan]], leader of the first fleet to sail around the world.\n\nUnder the Nationalist regime of 1939\u20131975, the only holder of the rank of ''capit\u00e1n general de la armada'' was the [[Caudillo]], [[General\u00edsimo]] [[Francisco Franco]].<ref name=fnff/>\n\n====Air force====\n{{Main|Captain general of the Air Force}}\nThe rank of Captain General of the [[Spanish Air Force|Air Force]], originally created by Franco for himself, currently is reserved for the reigning monarch.<ref name=fnff/>\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\n==== Army ====\n\nThe title was given, in 1508, to the commander-in-chief of the ''[[Ordenan\u00e7as]]'' (the territorial army of the crown).\n\nDuring the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], after 1640, the \"Captain-General of the Arms of the Kingdom\", became the commander-in-chief of the [[Portuguese Army]], under the direct authority of the War Council and the King. In 1762 the post of the captain-general was replaced by the title ''marechal-general'' \u2013 [[Fieldmarshall|fieldmarshall-general]].\n\n==== Navy ====\nLike in the Army, the ''Capit\u00e3o-General da Armada Real'' (Captain-General of the Royal Navy) was the commander-in-chief of the [[Portuguese Navy]] in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n=== France ===\nThe title has been only sporadically used in France. During the 17th century, and for a short while, a rank between [[Lieutenant General]] and [[Marshal of France]] of this denomination was created. The king of France was the Captain [[General of the Army]], but was represented in the field by lieutenant generals who commanded in his absence.\n\n=== Kingdom of Bavaria ===\nIn the former [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], the ''generalkapit\u00e4n'' was the leader of the royal [[Hartschier]] guard. The position was associated with the highest class ranking in the ''Hofrangordnung'' (court order of precedence).<ref>[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905//AHofrangordnung ''''Hofrangordnung] (German) Meyers Gro\u00dfes Konversations-Lexikon.</ref>\n\n=== Papal States ===\nDuring the time of the [[Papal States]] the title of [[Captain General of the Church]] was given to the de facto commander-in-chief of the Papal Army.  It existed parallel to the office of [[Gonfalonier of the Church]], which was a more ceremonial position than a tactical military command position.  Both offices were abolished by [[Pope Innocent XII]] and replaced with the office of [[Flag-bearer of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\n===Czechia, Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine===\nThe term \"Captain General\" as [[Hetman]] (the word from the German [[Hauptmann]] \"Capitan\") is a political title from Eastern Europe, historically assigned to military commanders. It was the title of the second-highest military commander (after the monarch) in 15th- to 18th and 20th-century.\n\n=== Siam ===\nThe rank Captain General ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48}}) was used as the highest rank in [[Wild Tiger Corps]], this rank was exclusively for King [[Vajiravudh]] but in 1915 he created rank General of the Wild Tiger Corps ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e48\u0e32}}) for members who are leaders of corps. The rank was equivalent to Brigadier.\n\n==Current usage as a military rank and dignity==\n\n===Bolivia===\nIn [[Bolivia]], the head of state for the duration of his tenure has the rank and dignity of Captain General as head of the Armed forces, despite being a civilian.\n\n===Commonwealth realms===\nIn the armies of various [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the term ''Captain General'' (Captain-General in Canada) is used generally when describing the ceremonial head of a corps or unit. As such, [[Elizabeth II]], the monarch of each of the realms, is the Captain General of the British [[Royal Artillery]] and the [[Honourable Artillery Company]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39509&geotype=London&gpn=1941 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39864&geotype=London&gpn=2995 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Royal Australian Artillery]], and [[Royal New Zealand Artillery]] and [[Royal New Zealand Armoured Corps]].<ref name=LG39866>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=39866&geotype=London&gpn=3003 |newspaper=[[London Gazette]] |title=Official Public Record |access-date=6 May 2018 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Prince Harry]] is currently the [[Captain General Royal Marines]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2017/december/19/171219-prince-harry-succeeds-the-duke-of-edinburgh-as-captain-general-royal-marines |title=Prince Harry succeeds the Duke of Edinburgh as Captain General Royal Marines |work=[[British Royal Navy]] website |date=19 December 2017 |access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne other appointment of Captain General is in the [[Royal Company of Archers]] (The Queen\u2019s Body Guard for Scotland), a position currently held by [[David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie|the Earl of Airlie]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5009.asp |title=Royal Company of Archers |work=Official Website of the [[British Monarchy]] |access-date=6 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929230359/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5009.asp |archive-date=29 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Chile===\nIf the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and the Head of State are reunited in the same person, they are promoted to the permanent military rank of ''Captain General''. It has only happened three times in Chile's history ([[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Ramon Freire]] and [[Augusto Pinochet Ugarte]]). Current electoral provisions (as of 2008) forbid the Commander-in-Chief becoming President.\n\n===Spain===\n{{Main|Captain general (Spain)}}\nIn Spain, the title Captain General (''capit\u00e1n general'') is the highest military rank, and has since 1999 been exclusively borne by the [[Spanish monarch]] (currently [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]]). Assimilated to a [[NATO]] OF-11 rank (OF-10 until that year).\n\n==Administrative positions==\n{{Main|Captaincy}}\n\nThe term \"captain general\" can also be used to translate Spanish ''capit\u00e1n general'' or Portuguese ''capit\u00e3o-general'', administrative titles used in the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the [[Americas]]. Each was in charge of a [[captaincy]].\n\n===In the Spanish Empire and Latin America===\n''Capit\u00e1n General'' was the military title given to the [[Spain|Spanish]] military governor of a province of the [[Spanish Empire]], in the colonies usually also the president of the civilian [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]] (court of law).\n\n===In the Portuguese Empire===\nIn the Portuguese Empire, a ''capit\u00e3o-general'' (plural ''capit\u00e3es-generais'') was a governor of a ''capitania geral'' ([[captaincy general]]), with a higher rank than a ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' ([[captain-major]]) and directly subordinated to the Crown. A captaincy general had a higher category than the simple [[Captaincies of the Portuguese Empire|captaincies]] (also referred as subaltern captaincies). Sometimes, a captaincy general included one or more subaltern captaincies. The governors of the captaincies general were usually styled \"governor and captain-general\", with the term \"governor\" referring to his administrative role and the term \"captain-general\" referring to his military role as commander-in-chief of the troops in his captaincy.\n\nThe title ''capit\u00e3o-general'' was also associated to the roles of Governor-General or Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]] and of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. Thus, in Brazil, besides the captains-generals that were governors of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|several captaincies general]], existed a central captain-general that was the governor-general or Viceroy.\n\n==In fiction==\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Boromir]] is considered to be a captain general of [[Gondor]].\n\nIn the [[The Wheel of Time|Wheel of Time]] series by [[Robert Jordan]], \"captain-general\"  is the highest rank of the Ever Victorious Army of [[Seanchan]], excepting only the rank of ''marshal-general'', which may be temporarily assigned to a captain-general given the command of a [[theatre of war]]. In addition, captain-general is also the title of both the leader of the Queen's Guard of Andor and the head of the Green [[Ajah (Wheel of Time)|Ajah]] of the [[Aes Sedai]].\n\nIn the ''[[BattleTech]]'' universe, captain-general is the title of the military and political leader of the [[Free Worlds League]]. Since the 25th century, captain-generals have been members of the Marik family.\n\nIn ''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]'', [[Cesare Borgia]] is depicted in the office of [[Captain General of the Church|Captain General of the Papal Army]], a position he did in fact hold along with [[Gonfalonier of the Church]].\n\nIn the ''[[Ring of Fire (series)|Ring of Fire]]'' universe (created by [[Eric Flint]]), Gustav II Adolf, King of Sweden, is granted the newly created hereditary title of \"Captain General of the State of Thuringia\" (later known as the State of Thuringia-Franconia) at the end of the first book, entitled '1632'. This was a recognition of his authority over Thuringian territory as an integral part of the \"Confederated Principalities of Europe\", a Protestant substitute for the Holy Roman Empire which he created, while allowing the Thuringian government to continue to claim that it was a republic and not a monarchy.\n\nIn the [[Warhammer 40,000]] universe, the title Captain-General of the Adeptus Custodes is given to the head of the Adeptus Custodes, the elite 10,000 [[Genetic engineering in science fiction|genetically engineered]] supersoldiers who acted as the God-Emperor of Mankind's elite bodyguard, joining him in battle during the Great Crusade and [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]]. During the Horus Heresy, the Captain-General was Constantin Valdor, called the \"Emperor's Spear\". In the aftermath, the Captain-General was granted a position as a [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|High Lord of Terra]] and ultimate authority over who could approach the Golden Throne, where the Emperor was interred after his battle with the Warmaster Horus.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonel-in-Chief]]\n* [[Captain-major]]\n* [[Captaincy]], an administrative division in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires, governed by a captain general.\n* [[Five-star rank]]\n* [[General]], a description of the various general officer ranks, including the full general which is the successor to captain general\n* [[General Captaincy]]\n* [[List of senior officers of the British Army]]\n* [[List of titles and honours of Queen Elizabeth II#Honorary military positions|Queen Elizabeth II's honorary military positions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Gubernatorial titles]]\n[[Category:Military ranks]]\n[[Category:Military history of Spain]]\n[[Category:Portuguese colonization of the Americas]]\n", "name_user": "60.54.24.101", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_general"}

The outer atmosphere is inflated and tenuous, making the radius large and the surface temperature around {{convert|5000|K|C F|sigfig=2}} or lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the [[stellar classification|spectral types]] K and M, but also [[S-type star|class S stars]] and most [[carbon star]]s.\n\nRed giants differ in a way by which they generate energy:\n\n* most common red giants are stars on the [[red-giant branch]] (RGB) that are still [[stellar nucleosynthesis|fusing hydrogen]] into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core\n* [[red clump|red-clump]] stars in the cool half of the [[horizontal branch]], fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the [[triple-alpha process]]\n* [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] (AGB) stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate carbon\u2013oxygen core, and a hydrogen-burning shell just beyond that.\n\nMany of the well-known bright stars are red giants, because they are luminous and moderately common.

They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the [[Sun]]. However, their outer envelope is lower in temperature, giving them a reddish-orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun because of their great size. Red-giant-branch stars have luminosities up to nearly three thousand times that of the Sun ({{Solar luminosity|link=y}}), spectral types of K or M, have surface temperatures of 3,000\u20134,000 K, and radii up to about 200 times the Sun ({{Solar radius|link=y}}). Stars on the horizontal branch are hotter, with only a small range of luminosities around {{solar luminosity|75}}. Asymptotic-giant-branch stars range from similar luminosities as the brighter stars of the red-giant branch, up to several times more luminous at the end of the thermal pulsing phase.\n\nAmong the asymptotic-giant-branch stars belong the carbon stars of type C-N and late C-R, produced when carbon and other elements are convected to the surface in what is called a [[dredge-up]].<ref name=boothroyd>{{Cite journal | last1 = Boothroyd | first1 = A.

This brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure are sufficient to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core. The hydrogen-burning shell results in a situation that has been described as the ''mirror principle''; when the core within the shell contracts, the layers of the star outside the shell must expand. The detailed physical processes that cause this are complex, but the behaviour is necessary to satisfy simultaneous conservation of [[potential energy|gravitational]] and [[thermal energy]] in a star with the shell structure. The core contracts and heats up due to the lack of fusion, and so the outer layers of the star expand greatly, absorbing most of the extra energy from shell fusion. This process of cooling and expanding is the [[subgiant]] star.

More-massive stars burn disproportionately faster and so have a shorter lifetime than less massive stars.<ref name=zeilik>{{cite book | last=Zeilik | first=Michael A. |author2=Gregory, Stephan A. | title=Introductory Astronomy & Astrophysics | edition=4th | date=1998 | publisher=Saunders College Publishing | isbn=0-03-006228-4 | pages=321\u2013322 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core, nuclear reactions can no longer continue and so the core begins to contract due to its own gravity. This brings additional hydrogen into a zone where the temperature and pressure are sufficient to cause fusion to resume in a shell around the core. The hydrogen-burning shell results in a situation that has been described as the ''mirror principle''; when the core within the shell contracts, the layers of the star outside the shell must expand. The detailed physical processes that cause this are complex, but the behaviour is necessary to satisfy simultaneous conservation of [[potential energy|gravitational]] and [[thermal energy]] in a star with the shell structure. The core contracts and heats up due to the lack of fusion, and so the outer layers of the star expand greatly, absorbing most of the extra energy from shell fusion. This process of cooling and expanding is the [[subgiant]] star. When the envelope of the star cools sufficiently it becomes convective, the star stops expanding, its luminosity starts to increase, and the star is ascending the [[red-giant branch]] of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram|Hertzsprung\u2013Russell (H\u2013R) diagram]].<ref name=zeilik/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Tiago L.

Once the degenerate core reaches this temperature, the entire core will begin helium fusion nearly simultaneously in a so-called [[helium flash]].

However, these giant planets are more massive than the giant planets found around solar-type stars. This could be because giant stars are more massive than the Sun (less massive stars will still be on the [[main sequence]] and will not have become giants yet) and more massive stars are expected to have more massive planets. However, the masses of the planets that have been found around giant stars do not correlate with the masses of the stars; therefore, the planets could be growing in mass during the stars' red giant phase. The growth in planet mass could be partly due to accretion from stellar wind, although a much larger effect would be [[Roche lobe]] overflow causing mass-transfer from the star to the planet when the giant expands out to the orbital distance of the planet.<ref name=jones>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014A&A...566A.113J|arxiv=1406.0884|title=The properties of planets around giant stars|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=566|pages=A113|last1=Jones|first1=M.

They are closed magnetic loops which connect regions of opposite magnetic polarity. Electrons are captured in these loops, and cause them to glow very brightly. The solar wind elongates these loops to pointy tips. They far extend above most prominences into the [[solar corona|corona]], and can be readily observed during a solar eclipse. Helmet streamers are usually confined to the \"streamer belt\" in the mid latitudes, and their distribution follows the movement of active regions during the [[solar cycle]].

They are closed magnetic loops which connect regions of opposite magnetic polarity. Electrons are captured in these loops, and cause them to glow very brightly. The solar wind elongates these loops to pointy tips. They far extend above most prominences into the [[corona]], and can be readily observed during a solar eclipse. Helmet streamers are usually confined to the \"streamer belt\" in the mid latitudes, and their distribution follows the movement of active regions during the [[solar cycle]].

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"]. [[ASCAP]] ''Playback Magazine''. Late 2003.</ref> In 2019, Perry revealed that she had initially written the song for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who turned it down.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/linda-perry-my-life-in-15-songs-780874/pink-get-the-party-started-2001-780880/</ref>\n\nThe entire song uses only one chord, solidly in [[B minor]].\n\n==Critical response==\n[[AllMusic]] highlighted the song and added: \"This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy dancefloor anthems like \"Get the Party Started.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/m!ssundaztood-mw0000588530|title=M!ssundaztood - P!nk - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Jim Farber was favorable: \"The single \"Get the Party Started\" has the tricky synth hook of a perfect new-wave hit from the '80s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,253257,00.html|title=M!ssundaztood|date=23 November 2001|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' was less positive: \"displays the kind of clod-hopping attention-seeking on single 'Get the Party Started' that makes you assume you're listening to a [[Geri Halliwell]] record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/name/6038|title=Pink  : M!ssundaztood - NME|website=NME}}</ref> Jason Thompson described this song and praised: \"the dance inducing \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d. Again, even this isn\u2019t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans. This track should do just the same thing. It did for me, anyway.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/pink-missundaztood/|title=Pink: M!ssundaztood|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Slant Magazine]] called this song \"retro-dipped dance-pop.\"<ref name=\"slantmagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/pink-missundaztood/154 |title=Pink: Missundaztood &#124; Music Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2001-11-25 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}</ref> [[Sputnikmusic]] marked it as a highlight and added: \"It is not all slow and serious going though, as 1st single \u2018Get The Party Started\u2019 proves. As the song title suggests, this is the dance-oriented party-starter that the artist\u2019s debut album lacked.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/27594/P!nk-M!ssundaztood/|title=Review: Pink - M!ssundaztood - Sputnikmusic|website=www.sputnikmusic.com}}</ref> ''Stylus'' magazine called the song \"near perfection.\"<ref>[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/pink/mssundaztood.htm Pink - M!ssundaztood - Review - Stylus Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204230545/http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/pink/mssundaztood.htm |date=2010-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe song reached number four on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on December 29, 2001, becoming one of Pink's biggest solo hits in the U.S. with \"[[Most Girls (Pink song)|Most Girls]]\" also reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2000 and \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\", \"[[Raise Your Glass]]\", and \"[[Just Give Me a Reason]]\" reaching number one in 2008, 2010, and 2013 respectively, and \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" that reached number two in America. The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus as well as the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"].

Again, even this isn\u2019t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus, and also cutting out the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007.

CT Bike is where Tony Hawk made his debut when he was just a young boy on his first East Coast tour.  The indoor skate park today is still operated by the same family who built the park despite a fire that threatened the park in 1988.\n\nIn more extreme climates, parks were built indoors, often using wood or metal. By the end of the 1970s, the popularity of skateboarding had waned, and the original parks of the era began to close. A downturn in the overall skateboard market in the 1980s, coupled with high liability insurance premiums, contributed to the demise of the first wave of skateparks. Some second-generation parks, such as [[Upland, California]]'s Pipeline, survived into the 1980s. However, few of the private parks of the 1970s remain, with the notable exception of [[Kona Skatepark]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], United States.<ref name=Kona>{{cite news |title= KONA |author= Matt Soergel |url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070107/lif_180996667.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]] |date= July 1, 2007 |accessdate= August 18, 2011 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121009145231/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070107/lif_180996667.shtml |archivedate= October 9, 2012 }}</ref> However, many public parks of that era can still be found throughout Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe modern skatepark designs of the Pacific Northwest can be traced back to [[Burnside Skatepark]], a [[DIY]] \"barge build\" beneath the [[Burnside Bridge]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Skateboarders used an area populated primarily by the city's \"undesirable elements\" to create a skatepark, building one section at a time. The process is called \"design/build\" (D/B), and is a characteristic of many skateparks today. The design/build process ensures that adjacent skatepark features are harmonious and rideable, allowing skateboarders to create endless \"lines\" to ride among the many features.\n\nSkate parks, related obstacles/ramps and locations designed for [[extreme sport]] utilization have made their way into the media over time, such as with the aforementioned Burnside Skatepark being included in the movie [[Free Willy]].\n\nPublic skateparks have had a resurgence in the US, made possible by legislation such as California's 1998 law stating that skateboarding is an inherently \"Hazardous Recreational Activity\" (HRA), and therefore municipalities and their employees may not be held liable for claims of negligence resulting in skateboarders' injuries.\n\nStreet skating has blurred the line between skateparks and street spots. Some cities are starting to put in skate spots/plazas with features that would not have been classically designed for skateboarding, but can be skated by street skaters legally. In some instances, street spots that were not originally designed for skateboarding have been converted into sanctioned skate plazas.\n\nThere is also an emerging movement of making art and sculpture skate-able. This provides additional legal skate spots that blend well with other city art and landscape features. Skate-able art allows for the creation of thriving multi-use areas, as installations often become picturesque destinations for skaters and non-skaters alike.\n\n==Types==\nUnlike organized sports, like basketball or football, skateboarding has no set arena or rules and skateparks have no standard design template. Each skatepark is designed specifically to provide unique challenges to its users. There are, however, three main categories of skatepark design: bowl, street plaza and flow parks.\n\nBowl parks are designed to emulate and improve upon the pool skating experience. Skaters in bowl parks can move around the park without taking their feet off the board to push. The curved walls of bowls allow skaters to ride around and across the bowl in addition to the back and forth skating you might see on a traditional half pipe. Bowls and bowl parks come in an endless variety of shapes and sizes but most bowls are between 3' and 12\u2019 deep.\n\nStreet plaza parks are the favorite of the vast majority of skaters and they are designed to emulate and improve upon the street skating experience. Obstacles in a street plaza are styled to look like natural street terrain such as stairs, railings, planters and benches. Skaters will push off with their feet to gain momentum in a street plaza. The first public outdoor skate plaza is the [[Vancouver Skate Plaza]], built in 2004 by New Line Skateparks.\n\nFlow parks (or Park style) combine elements of both bowl parks and street plazas. In a well designed flow park a skater can pump around the parks curved walls such as quarter pipes, pump bumps and bowl corners without taking their feet off to push. They can use that speed to hit street obstacles such as stairs, railings and benches.\n\nSkateparks may be privately or publicly owned. Privately owned skateparks usually have admission fees, while publicly owned skateparks are generally free. Many privately owned skateparks are indoors, usually in warehouses, roller rinks or buildings with high ceilings, especially in areas with snowy winters. Public skateparks are usually outdoors.\n\nSkatepark construction can be divided into two major categories \u2014 prefabricated and custom built concrete. Prefabricated parks can be made of wood, plastic, sheet metal, and concrete. Most are designed and built by playground equipment manufacturers who present these parks as a cost-effective alternative to custom-designed concrete skateparks. In reality, custom built concrete skateparks can be quite cost competitive with prefabricated skate ramps.\n\nConcrete parks, now \"pretty much the industry standard\", according to an editor of ''Transworld Skateboarding'' magazine, they require fewer repairs and less maintenance.<ref>Porstner, Donna, \"Curve appeal / Area's new skate park opens\", news article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], July 13, 2007, pp 1, A6</ref>\n\n==Elements==\n* [[Quarter pipe]] \u2013 Literal quarter of a pipe. There is usually a narrow metal rod running the length of the top edge; this is called the coping. There may also be a flat platform connected to it at the top; this is called the deck. Quarter pipes have \"transitions\" which is the size of the radius of the ramps riding surface.\n* [[Half pipe]] \u2013 Two Quarter Pipes facing each other (half of a pipe). A smaller halfpipe that is less than 8\u201310 feet can be referred to as a \"mini ramp\"\n* Bowl \u2013 a completely enclosed area of quarterpipes that curve in corners. The curve placement and opposing quarterpipe placement can manifest in any fashion.\n* Deck \u2013 The flat elevated area used as a staging area above ramps and bowls.\n* Spine \u2013 Two quarter pipes placed back to back, that do not contain a deck.

CT Bike is where Tony Hawk made his debut when he was just a young boy on his first East Coast tour.  The indoor skate park today is still operated by the same family who built the park despite a fire that threatened the park in 1988.\n\nIn more extreme climates, parks were built indoors, often using wood or metal. By the end of the 1970s, the popularity of skateboarding had waned, and the original parks of the era began to close. A downturn in the overall skateboard market in the 1980s, coupled with high liability insurance premiums, contributed to the demise of the first wave of skateparks. Some second-generation parks, such as [[Upland, California]]'s Pipeline, survived into the 1980s. However, few of the private parks of the 1970s remain, with the notable exception of [[Kona Skatepark]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], United States.<ref name=Kona>{{cite news |title= KONA |author= Matt Soergel |url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070107/lif_180996667.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]] |date= July 1, 2007 |accessdate= August 18, 2011 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121009145231/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070107/lif_180996667.shtml |archivedate= October 9, 2012 }}</ref> However, many public parks of that era can still be found throughout Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe modern skatepark designs of the Pacific Northwest can be traced back to [[Burnside Skatepark]], a [[DIY]] \"barge build\" beneath the [[Burnside Bridge]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Skateboarders used an area populated primarily by the city's \"undesirable elements\" to create a skatepark, building one section at a time. The process is called \"design/build\" (D/B), and is a characteristic of many skateparks today. The design/build process ensures that adjacent skatepark features are harmonious and rideable, allowing skateboarders to create endless \"lines\" to ride among the many features.\n\nSkate parks, related obstacles/ramps and locations designed for [[extreme sport]] utilization have made their way into the media over time, such as with the aforementioned Burnside Skatepark being included in the movie [[Free Willy]].\n\nPublic skateparks have had a resurgence in the US, made possible by legislation such as California's 1998 law stating that skateboarding is an inherently \"Hazardous Recreational Activity\" (HRA), and therefore municipalities and their employees may not be held liable for claims of negligence resulting in skateboarders' injuries.\n\nStreet skating has blurred the line between skateparks and street spots. Some cities are starting to put in skate spots/plazas with features that would not have been classically designed for skateboarding, but can be skated by street skaters legally. In some instances, street spots that were not originally designed for skateboarding have been converted into sanctioned skate plazas.\n\nThere is also an emerging movement of making art and sculpture skate-able. This provides additional legal skate spots that blend well with other city art and landscape features. Skate-able art allows for the creation of thriving multi-use areas, as installations often become picturesque destinations for skaters and non-skaters alike.\n\n==Types==\nUnlike organized sports, like basketball or football, skateboarding has no set arena or rules and skateparks have no standard design template. Each skatepark is designed specifically to provide unique challenges to its users. There are, however, three main categories of skatepark design: bowl, street plaza and flow parks.\n\nBowl parks are designed to emulate and improve upon the pool skating experience. Skaters in bowl parks can move around the park without taking their feet off the board to push. The curved walls of bowls allow skaters to ride around and across the bowl in addition to the back and forth skating you might see on a traditional half pipe. Bowls and bowl parks come in an endless variety of shapes and sizes but most bowls are between 3' and 12\u2019 deep.\n\nStreet plaza parks are the favorite of the vast majority of skaters and they are designed to emulate and improve upon the street skating experience. Obstacles in a street plaza are styled to look like natural street terrain such as stairs, railings, planters and benches. Skaters will push off with their feet to gain momentum in a street plaza. The first public outdoor skate plaza is the [[Vancouver Skate Plaza]], built in 2004 by New Line Skateparks.\n\nFlow parks (or Park style) combine elements of both bowl parks and street plazas. In a well designed flow park a skater can pump around the parks curved walls such as quarter pipes, pump bumps and bowl corners without taking their feet off to push. They can use that speed to hit street obstacles such as stairs, railings and benches.\n\nSkateparks may be privately or publicly owned. Privately owned skateparks usually have admission fees, while publicly owned skateparks are generally free. Many privately owned skateparks are indoors, usually in warehouses, roller rinks or buildings with high ceilings, especially in areas with snowy winters. Public skateparks are usually outdoors.\n\nSkatepark construction can be divided into two major categories \u2014 prefabricated and custom built concrete. Prefabricated parks can be made of wood, plastic, sheet metal, and concrete. Most are designed and built by playground equipment manufacturers who present these parks as a cost-effective alternative to custom-designed concrete skateparks. In reality, custom built concrete skateparks can be quite cost competitive with prefabricated skate ramps.\n\nConcrete parks, now \"pretty much the industry standard\", according to an editor of ''Transworld Skateboarding'' magazine, they require fewer repairs and less maintenance.<ref>Porstner, Donna, \"Curve appeal / Area's new skate park opens\", news article in ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], July 13, 2007, pp 1, A6</ref>\n\n==Elements==\n* [[Quarter pipe]] \u2013 Literal quarter of a pipe. There is usually a narrow metal rod running the length of the top edge; this is called the coping. There may also be a flat platform connected to it at the top; this is called the deck. Quarter pipes have \"transitions\" which is the size of the radius of the ramps riding surface.\n* [[Half pipe]] \u2013 Two Quarter Pipes facing each other (half of a pipe). A smaller halfpipe that is less than 8\u201310 feet can be referred to as a \"mini ramp\"\n* Bowl \u2013 a completely enclosed area of quarterpipes that curve in corners. The curve placement and opposing quarterpipe placement can manifest in any fashion.\n* Deck \u2013 The flat elevated area used as a staging area above ramps and bowls.\n* Spine \u2013 Two quarter pipes placed back to back, that do not contain a deck. Spines may exist in bowls and half-pipes\n* Extension \u2013 extensions in quarter pipe or halfpipe ramps.\n* Escalator \u2013 sloping increases or decreases in quarterpipe or halfpipe ramp.\n* Flat \u2013 The flat lower areas between transitions, usually at grade.\n* Vert wall \u2013 A vertical wall above, and sometimes slightly behind, a quarter pipe.\n* Bank \u2013 These can vary in angle but are simply wedge ramps for traversing obstacles, i.e. elevated flats. They may contain curvature at the tops or on sides.\n* Hip \u2013 Essentially two quarter pipes or banks forming an angle.\n* [[Funbox]] \u2013 A combination of banks, flats, rails, kickers, etc. connected to each other to form mini gaps.\n* Pyramid \u2013 Funbox-type ramp made from four banks put in a [[square pyramid]] shape, usually surrounding a flat.\n* Launcher/Kicker \u2013 A curved bank a rider uses to launch into the air.\n* Roll-in \u2013 A long sloping ramp used to gain speed.\n* Step-up/Eurobox \u2013 A funbox type ramp consisting of a bank with a flat at the top and a second, higher flat after it; in other words a bank-to-flat setup with a section removed from the bank part.\n* Wall-box \u2013 In an indoor skatepark, this is a funbox built against the wall of the park; in an outdoor skatepark, it is a funbox with a wall splitting it down the middle.\n* Pool \u2013 Usually an actual [[swimming pool]] that has been drained out for skateboarding. \n* Foam Pit \u2013 A pile of foam pads to land safely into while learning tricks, usually found after a launch ramp.\n* Flatbar \u2013 A rail set level with ground.\n* Sloped rail \u2013 A rail set at an angle.\n* Kinked rail \u2013 A rail with two flat sections, one higher than the other, and a sloped section in the middle connecting them.\n* Stair \u2013 A simple staircase.\n* Handrail \u2013 A rail going with a staircase, either extended from the staircase or off an adjacent wall\n* Kidney bowl \u2013 a bowl roughly in the shape of a human kidney\n* Egg bowl \u2013 a bowl shaped like an egg\n* Cradle \u2013 Spherical bowl turned on its side, typically connected with a bowl.

While at law school, Martin became bored with the life of class by day and library by night and decided to spice things up. He began to neglect his studies and attend class in bizarre fashion, one time suiting up in a full gorilla costume. As his interest in comedy grew, Martin began to debate dropping out of school.

While at law school, Martin became bored with the life of class by day and library by night and decided to spice things up.
