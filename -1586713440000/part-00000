Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.]]\n\nBreast cancer, like other [[cancers]], occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.\n\nNormal cells will commit cell suicide ([[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]) when they are no longer needed. Until then, they are protected from cell suicide by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] pathway; another is the [[Ras (protein)|RAS]]/[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]]/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently \"on\", rendering the cell incapable of committing suicide when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the \"on\" position, and the cancer cell does not commit suicide.<ref>{{Cite conference |author1 = Adrian Lee |author2 = Carlos Arteaga |title = 32nd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium |booktitle = Sunday Morning Year-End Review |date = 14 December 2009 |url = http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813021816/http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMutations that can lead to breast cancer have been experimentally linked to estrogen exposure.<ref name=\"pmid16675129\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cavalieri E, Chakravarti D, Guttenplan J, Hart E, Ingle J, Jankowiak R, Muti P, Rogan E, Russo J, Santen R, Sutter T | display-authors = 6 | title = Catechol estrogen quinones as initiators of breast and other human cancers: implications for biomarkers of susceptibility and cancer prevention | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1766 | issue = 1 | pages = 63\u201378 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16675129 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbcan.2006.03.001 }}</ref> Additionally, G-protein coupled estrogen receptors have been associated with various cancers of the female reproductive system including breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filardo EJ | title = A role for G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis: Dysregulated glandular homeostasis, survival and metastasis | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 176 | pages = 38\u201348 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28595943 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.05.005 }}</ref>\n\nAbnormal [[growth factor]] signaling in the interaction between [[stromal cell]]s and [[epithelial cell]]s can facilitate malignant cell growth.<ref name=\"pmid12817994\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Haslam SZ, Woodward TL | title = Host microenvironment in breast cancer development: epithelial-cell-stromal-cell interactions and steroid hormone action in normal and cancerous mammary gland | journal = Breast Cancer Research | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 208\u201315 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12817994 | pmc = 165024 | doi = 10.1186/bcr615 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiseman BS, Werb Z | title = Stromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancer | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5570 | pages = 1046\u20139 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12004111 | pmc = 2788989 | doi = 10.1126/science.1067431 | bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1046W }}</ref> In breast adipose tissue, overexpression of leptin leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.<ref name=\"pmid20889333\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jard\u00e9 T, Perrier S, Vasson MP, Caldefie-Ch\u00e9zet F | title = Molecular mechanisms of leptin and adiponectin in breast cancer | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201343 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20889333 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.09.005 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, 10 to 20 percent of people with breast cancer and people with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases.

In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary Ann|last=Kosir|date=July 2019|title=Merck Manual, Professional Edition|chapter-url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live|chapter=Ch. 253, Breast Cancer}}</ref>\n* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.\n* '''Stage'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|Breast cancer staging]] using the [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|TNM system]] is based on the size of the <u>t</u>umor ('''T'''), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph node|lymph]] <u>n</u>odes ('''N''') in the armpits, and whether the tumor has <u>m</u>etastasized ('''M''') (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. <br />The main stages are:\n** Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS).\n** Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n** Stage 4 is [[Metastatic breast cancer|'metastatic' cancer]] that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes. \n<gallery>\nFile:Diagram showing stage T1 breast cancer CRUK 244.svg|Stage T1 breast cancer\nFile:Diagram showing stage T2 breast cancer CRUK 252.svg|Stage T2 breast cancer\nFile:Diagram showing stage T3 breast cancer CRUK 259.svg|Stage T3 breast cancer\nFile:Stage 4 of Breast Cancer.jpg|Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n</gallery>\n\n:Where available, [[imaging studies]] may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer. However, in cases of breast cancer with low risk for metastasis, the risks associated with [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], or [[Bone scintigraphy|bone scans]] outweigh the possible benefits, as these procedures expose the person to a substantial amount of potentially dangerous ionizing radiation.<ref name=\"ASCOfive\">{{Citation |author1 = American Society of Clinical Oncology |author1-link = American Society of Clinical Oncology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |access-date = 14 August 2012 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073425/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Clin_Onc.pdf |archive-date = 31 July 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"CarlsonBreast\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Carlson RW, Allred DC, Anderson BO, Burstein HJ, Carter WB, Edge SB, Erban JK, Farrar WB, Goldstein LJ, Gradishar WJ, Hayes DF, Hudis CA, Jahanzeb M, Kiel K, Ljung BM, Marcom PK, Mayer IA, McCormick B, Nabell LM, Pierce LJ, Reed EC, Smith ML, Somlo G, Theriault RL, Topham NS, Ward JH, Winer EP, Wolff AC | display-authors = 6 | title = Breast cancer.

One of the most common regimens, known as \"AC\",  combines [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[doxorubicin]]. Sometimes a [[taxane]] drug, such as [[docetaxel]], is added, and the regime is then known as \"CAT\". Another common treatment is cyclophosphamide, [[methotrexate]], and [[fluorouracil]] (or \"CMF\"). Most chemotherapy medications work by destroying fast-growing and/or fast-replicating cancer cells, either by causing DNA damage upon replication or by other mechanisms.

The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive.

These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating [[stroma (animal tissue)|stromal]] cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard [[growth medium|media]]. The first breast cancer cell line described, [[BT-20 (cell line)|BT-20]], was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from [[pleural effusion]]s. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by [[fibroblasts]] and other tumor stroma cells.\nMany of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely [[MCF-7]], [[T-47D]], and [[MDA-MB-231]], account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a [[Medline]]-based survey.\n\n=== Molecular markers ===\n\n==== Transcription factors ====\n\n[[NFAT]] transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation.

Mutations leading to loss of this ability can lead to cancer formation.]]\n\nBreast cancer, like other [[cancers]], occurs because of an interaction between an environmental (external) factor and a genetically susceptible host. Normal cells divide as many times as needed and stop. They attach to other cells and stay in place in tissues. Cells become cancerous when they lose their ability to stop dividing, to attach to other cells, to stay where they belong, and to die at the proper time.\n\nNormal cells will commit cell suicide ([[apoptosis|programmed cell death]]) when they are no longer needed. Until then, they are protected from cell suicide by several protein clusters and pathways. One of the protective pathways is the [[PI3K]]/[[AKT]] pathway; another is the [[Ras (protein)|RAS]]/[[Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase|MEK]]/[[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] pathway. Sometimes the genes along these protective pathways are mutated in a way that turns them permanently \"on\", rendering the cell incapable of committing suicide when it is no longer needed. This is one of the steps that causes cancer in combination with other mutations. Normally, the [[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]] protein turns off the PI3K/AKT pathway when the cell is ready for programmed cell death. In some breast cancers, the gene for the PTEN protein is mutated, so the PI3K/AKT pathway is stuck in the \"on\" position, and the cancer cell does not commit suicide.<ref>{{Cite conference |author1 = Adrian Lee |author2 = Carlos Arteaga |title = 32nd Annual CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium |booktitle = Sunday Morning Year-End Review |date = 14 December 2009 |url = http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813021816/http://www.sabcs.org/Newsletter/Docs/SABCS_2009_Issue5.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMutations that can lead to breast cancer have been experimentally linked to estrogen exposure.<ref name=\"pmid16675129\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cavalieri E, Chakravarti D, Guttenplan J, Hart E, Ingle J, Jankowiak R, Muti P, Rogan E, Russo J, Santen R, Sutter T | display-authors = 6 | title = Catechol estrogen quinones as initiators of breast and other human cancers: implications for biomarkers of susceptibility and cancer prevention | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1766 | issue = 1 | pages = 63\u201378 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16675129 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbcan.2006.03.001 }}</ref> Additionally, G-protein coupled estrogen receptors have been associated with various cancers of the female reproductive system including breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filardo EJ | title = A role for G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in estrogen-induced carcinogenesis: Dysregulated glandular homeostasis, survival and metastasis | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 176 | pages = 38\u201348 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28595943 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2017.05.005 }}</ref>\n\nAbnormal [[growth factor]] signaling in the interaction between [[stromal cell]]s and [[epithelial cell]]s can facilitate malignant cell growth.<ref name=\"pmid12817994\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Haslam SZ, Woodward TL | title = Host microenvironment in breast cancer development: epithelial-cell-stromal-cell interactions and steroid hormone action in normal and cancerous mammary gland | journal = Breast Cancer Research | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 208\u201315 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12817994 | pmc = 165024 | doi = 10.1186/bcr615 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiseman BS, Werb Z | title = Stromal effects on mammary gland development and breast cancer | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5570 | pages = 1046\u20139 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12004111 | pmc = 2788989 | doi = 10.1126/science.1067431 | bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1046W }}</ref> In breast adipose tissue, overexpression of leptin leads to increased cell proliferation and cancer.<ref name=\"pmid20889333\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jard\u00e9 T, Perrier S, Vasson MP, Caldefie-Ch\u00e9zet F | title = Molecular mechanisms of leptin and adiponectin in breast cancer | journal = European Journal of Cancer | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 33\u201343 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20889333 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejca.2010.09.005 }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, 10 to 20 percent of people with breast cancer and people with ovarian cancer have a first- or second-degree relative with one of these diseases.

Presumably, they allow further mutations, which allow uncontrolled division, lack of attachment, and metastasis to distant organs.<ref name=\"acs bc facts 2005-6\">{{cite web |author = American Cancer Society |year = 2005 |title = Breast Cancer Facts & Figures 2005\u20132006 |url = http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |access-date = 26 April 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070613192148/http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/CAFF2005BrFacspdf2005.pdf |archive-date = 13 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunning AM, Healey CS, Pharoah PD, Teare MD, Ponder BA, Easton DF | title = A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer risk | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 843\u201354 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10548311 | doi =  | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10548311 }}</ref> However, there is strong evidence of residual risk variation that goes well beyond hereditary ''BRCA'' gene mutations between carrier families.

A local anesthetic may be used to numb the breast tissue to prevent pain during the procedure, but may not be necessary if the lump isn't beneath the skin.

Breast cancer is usually classified primarily by its [[Breast cancer classification#Histopathology|histological]] appearance. Most breast cancers are derived from the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as [[mammary ductal carcinoma|ductal]] or lobular carcinoma. ''Carcinoma in situ'' is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, ''invasive carcinoma'' does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary Ann|last=Kosir|date=July 2019|title=Merck Manual, Professional Edition|chapter-url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live|chapter=Ch. 253, Breast Cancer}}</ref>\n* '''Grade'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Grade|Grading]] compares the appearance of the breast cancer cells to the appearance of normal breast tissue.  Normal cells in an organ like the breast become differentiated, meaning that they take on specific shapes and forms that reflect their function as part of that organ. Cancerous cells lose that differentiation. In cancer, the cells that would normally line up in an orderly way to make up the milk ducts become disorganized. Cell division becomes uncontrolled. Cell nuclei become less uniform. Pathologists describe cells as well differentiated (low grade), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade), and poorly differentiated (high grade) as the cells progressively lose the features seen in normal breast cells. Poorly differentiated cancers (the ones whose tissue is least like normal breast tissue) have a worse prognosis.\n* '''Stage'''. [[Breast cancer classification#Stage|Breast cancer staging]] using the [[Breast cancer classification#TNM system|TNM system]] is based on the size of the <u>t</u>umor ('''T'''), whether or not the tumor has spread to the [[lymph node|lymph]] <u>n</u>odes ('''N''') in the armpits, and whether the tumor has <u>m</u>etastasized ('''M''') (i.e. spread to a more distant part of the body). Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis. <br />The main stages are:\n** Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS) or [[lobular carcinoma in situ]] (LCIS).\n** Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n** Stage 4 is [[Metastatic breast cancer|'metastatic' cancer]] that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes. \n<gallery>\nFile:Diagram showing stage T1 breast cancer CRUK 244.svg|Stage T1 breast cancer\nFile:Diagram showing stage T2 breast cancer CRUK 252.svg|Stage T2 breast cancer\nFile:Diagram showing stage T3 breast cancer CRUK 259.svg|Stage T3 breast cancer\nFile:Stage 4 of Breast Cancer.jpg|Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n</gallery>\n\n:Where available, [[imaging studies]] may be employed as part of the staging process in select cases to look for signs of metastatic cancer.

Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |title = Breast Cancer: Breast Disorders: Merck Manual Professional |publisher = Merck.com |access-date = 8 May 2010 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111110075702/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology_and_obstetrics/breast_disorders/breast_cancer.html |archive-date = 10 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n* Stage 1 cancers (and DCIS, LCIS) have an excellent prognosis and are generally treated with lumpectomy and sometimes radiation.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |title = Surgery Choices for Women with Early Stage Breast Cancer |publisher = National Cancer Institute and the National Research Center for Women & Families |date = August 2004 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130813054115/http://www.stopcancerfund.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/booklet04bc.pdf |archive-date = 13 August 2013 }}</ref> \n* Stage 2 and 3 cancers with a progressively poorer prognosis and greater risk of recurrence are generally treated with surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without [[Lymphadenectomy|lymph node removal]]), chemotherapy (plus [[trastuzumab]] for HER2+ cancers) and sometimes radiation (particularly following large cancers, multiple positive nodes or lumpectomy).{{mcn|date=May 2018}}\n* Stage 4, metastatic cancer, (i.e. spread to distant sites) has a poor prognosis and is managed by various combination of all treatments from surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies.

When surgery advanced, and long-term survival rates improved, women began [[raising awareness]] of the disease and the possibility of successful treatment.  The \"Women's Field Army\", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later the [[American Cancer Society]]) during the 1930s and 1940s was one of the first organized campaigns.

These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating [[stroma (animal tissue)|stromal]] cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard [[growth medium|media]]. The first breast cancer cell line described, [[BT-20 (cell line)|BT-20]], was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer cell lines from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma. Most of the available breast cancer cell lines issued from metastatic tumors, mainly from [[pleural effusion]]s. Effusions provided generally large numbers of dissociated, viable tumor cells with little or no contamination by [[fibroblasts]] and other tumor stroma cells.\nMany of the currently used BCC lines were established in the late 1970s. A very few of them, namely [[MCF-7]], [[T-47D]], and [[MDA-MB-231]], account for more than two-thirds of all abstracts reporting studies on mentioned breast cancer cell lines, as concluded from a [[Medline]]-based survey.\n\n=== Molecular markers ===\n\n==== Transcription factors ====\n\n[[NFAT]] transcription factors are implicated in breast cancer, more specifically in the process of cell motility at the basis of metastasis formation. Indeed, NFAT1 (NFATC2) and NFAT5 are pro-invasive and pro-migratory in breast carcinoma<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jauliac S, L\u00f3pez-Rodriguez C, Shaw LM, Brown LF, Rao A, Toker A | title = The role of NFAT transcription factors in integrin-mediated carcinoma invasion | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 7 | pages = 540\u20134 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12080349 | doi = 10.1038/ncb816 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoeli-Lerner M, Yiu GK, Rabinovitz I, Erhardt P, Jauliac S, Toker A | title = Akt blocks breast cancer cell motility and invasion through the transcription factor NFAT | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 539\u201350 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16307918 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.10.033 }}</ref>  and NFAT3 (NFATc4) is an inhibitor of cell motility.<ref name=\"Foug\u00e8re 2292\u2013301\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Foug\u00e8re M, Gaudineau B, Barbier J, Guaddachi F, Feugeas JP, Auboeuf D, Jauliac S | title = NFAT3 transcription factor inhibits breast cancer cell motility by targeting the Lipocalin 2 gene | journal = Oncogene | volume = 29 | issue = 15 | pages = 2292\u2013301 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20101218 | doi = 10.1038/onc.2009.499 }}</ref>\nNFAT1 regulates the expression of the TWEAKR and its ligand TWEAK with the Lipocalin 2 to increase breast cancer cell invasion<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudineau B, Foug\u00e8re M, Guaddachi F, Lemoine F, de la Grange P, Jauliac S | title = Lipocalin 2, the TNF-like receptor TWEAKR and its ligand TWEAK act downstream of NFAT1 to regulate breast cancer cell invasion | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 19 | pages = 4475\u201386 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22767506 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.099879 }}</ref> and NFAT3 inhibits Lipocalin 2 expression to blunt the cell invasion.<ref name=\"Foug\u00e8re 2292\u2013301\" />\n\n==== Metabolic markers ====\n\nClinically, the most useful metabolic markers in breast cancer are the estrogen and progesterone receptors that are used to predict response to hormone therapy.

in the south-central [[San Joaquin Valley]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Kings County, California]]. It is the principal city of the [[Hanford-Corcoran metropolitan area]] (MSA Code 25260), which encompasses all of Kings County, including the cities of Hanford and [[Corcoran, California|Corcoran]]. The [[ZIP Code]] is 93230 (with 93232 used for [[post office box]]es). The city of Hanford is surrounded by communities that do not fall within the city limits but share the same ZIP Code. These communities include [[Grangeville, California|Grangeville]], [[Hardwick, California|Hardwick]] and [[Home Garden, California|Home Garden]].\n\nThe population was 53,967 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

The earliest dated grave in the area was that of a young Alice Spangler who was initially buried in the Kings River Cemetery just north of her family's farm in 1860.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35397207/alice-spangler|title=Grave|last=Spangler|first=|date=|website=FindAGrave|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=April 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> As the settlement grew, Tulare Lake's feeding rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation, causing it to gradually shrink and, over the 19th and 20th centuries, effectively become extinct.\n\nFrom the mid-to-late 1870s, the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] planned to lay tracks towards the developing farmland west of [[Visalia, California|Visalia]], spurring a growth in labor and population. Hanford's namesake was [[James Madison Hanford]], an executive for the company. The earliest known document labeling the settlement as \"Hanford\" is an 1876 map of [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]] which once included the territory of present-day [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://davidrumsey.georeferencer.com/maps/4b53d7e0-109e-5b4b-8c09-34dd774cedb4/view|title=Map Of Tulare County California.|last=GmbH (http://www.klokantech.com/)|first=Klokan Technologies|website=davidrumsey.georeferencer.com|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> Tracks were laid through a sheep camp in 1877.
