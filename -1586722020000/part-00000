In the 1950s and 1960s he was an Australian [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-code rugby international]] representative and had previously been a [[Queensland]] amateur boxing champion in 1958 and 1959, who trialled for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]].\n\n==Background==\nRaised in the [[Somerset Region]] in  [[Linville, Queensland]]<ref name=\"Writer\"/> to May Helena Ryan and her husband Matthew a bushman and horseman, he learnt the rudiments of boxing as a young boy.<ref name=\"Writer\">Writer p405-409</ref> He attended boarding-school for his high-school years at [[St Joseph's College, Nudgee]]<ref name=Nudgee>{{cite web\n| title =Mr Kevin Ryan\n| work =Nudgee Old Boy\n| publisher =[[St Joseph's College, Nudgee]]\n| url =http://oldweb.nudgee.com/06News&Events/nudgee_wallaby_legends.htm\n| accessdate =18 July 2011\n| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080722064013/http://oldweb.nudgee.com/06News%26Events/nudgee_wallaby_legends.htm\n| archive-date =22 July 2008\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref> from 1948-52 where he started to play [[rugby union]].\n\n==Rugby union career==\nAfter school Ryan played seven seasons with the [[Brothers Old Boys|Brisbane Brothers]] club from 1953 to 1959. In the Writer interview he refers to a senior [[player-coach]] role that he performed in his final two years at the club <ref name=\"Writer\"/> and he spoke of the loyalty he felt to the club in 1959 when having agreed terms with [[St. George Dragons|St George]] and having achieved his rugby union representative ambitions, he played out the 1959 season with [[Brothers Old Boys|Brothers]] and helped them win the 1959 Brisbane Club Premiership.<ref name=\"Writer\"/>\n\nHe was selected in the squad for the [[1957\u201358 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France]]. He made his international representative debut in the 3rd Test match of the tour, that against [[England national rugby union team]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] on 1 February 1958.<ref name=\"scrum\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/19908.html|title=Scrum.com player profile of Kevin Ryan|publisher=Scrum.com|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> Australian were beaten 9\u20136. Following the tour's end he made four further appearances for the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] in 1958, firstly against a visiting [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|NZ Maori All Blacks]] side and then in all three Tests against the [[All Blacks]] on the Wallabies 1958 tour of New Zealand.<ref name=\"scrum\" />\n\n==Rugby league career==\n\n===St. George===\nHe was a [[Rugby league positions#The front row|front rower]] or [[Rugby league positions#second row forward|second row forward]] with the [[St. George Dragons]] in the latter half of their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He played 106 games for the club from 1960\u20131966, and played in seven winning grand finals. Ryan took over the 'Hard Man' mantle in the St George forward pack from [[Billy Wilson (rugby league)|Billy Wilson]]. From 1960 to 1962 when Ryan, Wilson and [[Norm Provan]] played together the St George forward pack was formidable. Ryan perfected a ball-and-all, one-on-one tackling style. He disdained gang tackling believing it was his individual responsibility to bring his man down hard without help. He would leave the ground each time he tackled, often winding his opponent with his shoulder, then bringing them to ground wrapped up, ball included.<ref name=\"Writer\"/>\n\nDuring his footballing career Ryan was nicknamed 'Kandos' after the [[Kandos, New South Wales|New South Wales cement producing town]] due to his on-field toughness.\n\nHe was selected in the squad for the 1963 [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] tour of [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and played in four tour matches on the tour. Along with [[Jim Lisle]], Ryan made his international league debut in a tour match in England in 1963 but he did not play in any Tests on the tour. Collectively he and Lisle were Australia's 29th and 30th dual code rugby internationals. He later represented Australia in two domestic Tests against [[France national rugby league team|France]], making his [[Test match (rugby league)|Test debut]] in 1964 in the 2nd Test in July 1964 at [[Lang Park]], Brisbane. Ryan is listed on the ''Australian Players Register'' as Kangaroo No. 386.<ref>ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54</ref>\n\n===Canterbury-Bankstown===\nRyan left St George at the end of the 1966 season unable to come to terms in negotiations and wanting to coach.<ref name=\"Writer\"/> In 1967, as captain-coach, he led [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] in their 12\u201311 victory over St George in the preliminary final. He is therefore sometimes credited with bringing an end to the Dragons' premiership run.  Certainly he was able to coach against and counter many of their tactics but the game had changed for all in 1967 with the introduction of the four tackle rule and the now maturing Dragons stars like all other teams in the competition, had to deal with a whole new style of game.\n\nHe led Canterbury to the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1967#Grand Final|1967 Grand Final]] against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and was captain-coach at the club through to the middle of the 1969 season when he retired due to injury. He continued on as coach that year and for the 1970 season. He played 52 games for Canterbury, scoring five tries.\n\n==After football==\nAfter retiring from football, Ryan became a [[barrister]] in 1970, and was an Alderman or Mayor of the [[City of Hurstville]] from 1974 to 1979. He was elected as the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] member for [[Electoral district of Hurstville|Hurstville]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1976, defeating four-term [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal]] MP [[Tom Mead]], and serving until 1984. He had previously made an unsuccessful bid for the seat in 1973.<ref name=nsw>{{cite NSW Parliament |title =Mr Kevin James Ryan (1934- ) |id=1922 |former=Yes |accessdate=13 May 2019 }}</ref> Ryan was defeated by Liberal candidate [[Guy Yeomans]] at the [[1984 New South Wales state election|1984 New South Wales Legislative Assembly election]]. The result was considered a minor upset as Labor comfortably won the election overall. Ryan's critics within the Labor Party suggested that he had failed to nurse the electorate sufficiently. Ryan contested the [[1987 Bankstown state by-election|1987 Bankstown by-election]] as an independent in opposition to the official Labor candidate. He polled 18.6% but was third behind the Labor candidate [[Doug Shedden (politician)|Doug Shedden]].<ref name=\"Green Bankstown 1987 by-election\">{{cite web |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |title=1987 results Bankstown by-election |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/electionresults18562007/1984/Bankstown_1.htm |work=New South Wales Election Results 1856-2007 |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref> He contested the electorate again as an independent at the [[1988 New South Wales state election|1988 election]] but was again defeated with 18.7% of the vote.<ref name=\"Green Bankstown 1988\">{{cite web |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |title=1988 results Bankstown |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/electionresults18562007/1988/Bankstown.htm |work=New South Wales Election Results 1856-2007 |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nRyan was President of the Rugby League Players Association for many years and a sports commentator with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] from 1970 to 1973 where he usually worked alongside Alan Marks commentating on NSWRFL games. {{As of|2019}} he still practises as a [[barrister]] at the Selborne Chambers in Sydney.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr K J Ryan |url=http://find-a-barrister.nswbar.asn.au/profile/kevin-ryan-1189 |work=Find-a Barrister |publisher=NSW Bar Association |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nIn 2000 Ryan was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]]. In 2004 he was named at prop-forward for the [[Bulldogs Hall of Fame|Berries to Bulldogs 70 Year Team of Champions]] On 1 April 2007 he was inducted into the [[Bulldogs Hall of Fame|Bulldogs Ring of Champions]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Andrews, Malcolm (2006) ''The ABC of Rugby League'' Austn Broadcasting Corpn, Sydney\n* Writer, Larry (1995) ''Never Before, Never Again'', Pan MacMillan, Sydney\n* [[Alan Whiticker|Whiticker, Alan]]  & Hudson, Glen (2006) ''The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players'', Gavin Allen Publishing, Sydney\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071005031109/http://www.eraofthebiff.com/p27a.html Kevin Ryan at eraofthebiff.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080722064013/http://oldweb.nudgee.com/06News%26Events/nudgee_wallaby_legends.htm Nudgee Wallaby Legends]\n*[http://www.espnscrum.com/australia/rugby/player/6223.html Ryan rugby career at scrum.com]\n\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1960 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1961 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1962 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1963 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1964 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1965 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{St. George Dragons squad 1966 NSWRFL premiership}}\n{{1963-64 Kangaroo Tour squad}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ryan, Kevin James}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:Australia international rugby union players]]\n[[Category:Australia national rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league coaches]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league players]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby union players]]\n[[Category:Australian sportsperson-politicians]]\n[[Category:Brothers Old Boys players]]\n[[Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs coaches]]\n[[Category:Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs players]]\n[[Category:Clive Churchill Medal winners]]\n[[Category:Dual-code rugby internationals]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Ipswich, Queensland]]\n[[Category:St. George Dragons players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:City New South Wales rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:Australian male boxers]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Rugby league props]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Hurstville]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Australian politician, rugby union footballer, and rugby league footballer and coach}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=July 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox rugby league biography\n|name                = Kevin Ryan\n|fullname            = Kevin James Ryan\n|image               = File:Kevin_ryan.jpg\n|image_size          = \n|caption             = Kevin Ryan. 1965\n|birth_date          = {{Birth date and age|1934|8|26|df=yes}}\n|birth_place         = [[Ipswich, Queensland]]<ref name=\"scrum\" />\n|death_date          = \n|death_place         = \n|height              = \n|weight              = \n|retired             = yes\n|first = RU\n|ru_position         = [[Rugby union positions#1.

In the 1950s and 1960s he was an Australian [[List of dual-code rugby internationals|dual-code rugby international]] representative and had previously been a [[Queensland]] amateur boxing champion in 1958 and 1959, who trialled for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]].\n\n==Background==\nRaised in the [[Somerset Region]] in  [[Linville, Queensland]]<ref name=\"Writer\"/> to May Helena Ryan and her husband Matthew a bushman and horseman, he learnt the rudiments of boxing as a young boy.<ref name=\"Writer\">Writer p405-409</ref> He attended boarding-school for his high-school years at [[St Joseph's College, Nudgee]]<ref name=Nudgee>{{cite web\n| title =Mr Kevin Ryan\n| work =Nudgee Old Boy\n| publisher =[[St Joseph's College, Nudgee]]\n| url =http://oldweb.nudgee.com/06News&Events/nudgee_wallaby_legends.htm\n| accessdate =18 July 2011\n| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080722064013/http://oldweb.nudgee.com/06News%26Events/nudgee_wallaby_legends.htm\n| archive-date =22 July 2008\n| url-status =dead\n}}</ref> from 1948-52 where he started to play [[rugby union]].\n\n==Rugby union career==\nAfter school Ryan played seven seasons with the [[Brothers Old Boys|Brisbane Brothers]] club from 1953 to 1959. In the Writer interview he refers to a senior [[player-coach]] role that he performed in his final two years at the club <ref name=\"Writer\"/> and he spoke of the loyalty he felt to the club in 1959 when having agreed terms with [[St. George Dragons|St George]] and having achieved his rugby union representative ambitions, he played out the 1959 season with [[Brothers Old Boys|Brothers]] and helped them win the 1959 Brisbane Club Premiership.<ref name=\"Writer\"/>\n\nHe was selected in the squad for the [[1957\u201358 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France]]. He made his international representative debut in the 3rd Test match of the tour, that against [[England national rugby union team]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] on 1 February 1958.<ref name=\"scrum\" >{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/19908.html|title=Scrum.com player profile of Kevin Ryan|publisher=Scrum.com|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> Australian were beaten 9-6. Following the tour's end he made four further appearances for the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] in 1958, firstly against a visiting [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|NZ Maori All Blacks]] side and then in all three Tests against the [[All Blacks]] on the Wallabies 1958 tour of New Zealand.<ref name=\"scrum\" />\n\n==Rugby league career==\n\n===St. George===\nHe was a [[Rugby league positions#The front row|front rower]] or [[Rugby league positions#second row forward|second row forward]] with the [[St. George Dragons]] in the latter half of their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He played 106 games for the club from 1960\u20131966, and played in seven winning grand finals. Ryan took over the 'Hard Man' mantle in the St George forward pack from [[Billy Wilson (rugby league)|Billy Wilson]]. From 1960 to 1962 when Ryan, Wilson and [[Norm Provan]] played together the St George forward pack was formidable. Ryan perfected a ball-and-all, one-on-one tackling style. He disdained gang tackling believing it was his individual responsibility to bring his man down hard without help. He would leave the ground each time he tackled, often winding his opponent with his shoulder, then bringing them to ground wrapped up, ball included.<ref name=\"Writer\"/>\n\nDuring his footballing career Ryan was nicknamed 'Kandos' after the [[Kandos, New South Wales|New South Wales cement producing town]] due to his on-field toughness.\n\nHe was selected in the squad for the 1963 [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] tour of [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and played in four tour matches on the tour. Along with [[Jim Lisle]], Ryan made his international league debut in a tour match in England in 1963 but he did not play in any Tests on the tour. Collectively he and Lisle were Australia's 29th and 30th dual code rugby internationals. He later represented Australia in two domestic Tests against [[France national rugby league team|France]], making his [[Test match (rugby league)|Test debut]] in 1964 in the 2nd Test in July 1964 at [[Lang Park]], Brisbane. Ryan is listed on the ''Australian Players Register'' as Kangaroo No. 386.<ref>ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54</ref>\n\n===Canterbury-Bankstown===\nRyan left St George at the end of the 1966 season unable to come to terms in negotiations and wanting to coach.<ref name=\"Writer\"/> In 1967, as captain-coach, he led [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury]] in their 12-11 victory over St George in the preliminary final. He is therefore sometimes credited with bringing an end to the Dragons' premiership run.  Certainly he was able to coach against and counter many of their tactics but the game had changed for all in 1967 with the introduction of the four tackle rule and the now maturing Dragons stars like all other teams in the competition, had to deal with a whole new style of game.\n\nHe led Canterbury to the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1967#Grand Final|1967 Grand Final]] against [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]] and was captain-coach at the club through to the middle of the 1969 season when he retired due to injury. He continued on as coach that year and for the 1970 season. He played 52 games for Canterbury, scoring five tries.\n\n==After football==\nAfter retiring from football, Ryan became a [[barrister]] in 1970, and was an Alderman or Mayor of the [[City of Hurstville]] from 1974 to 1979. He was elected as the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] member for [[Electoral district of Hurstville|Hurstville]] in the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] in 1976, defeating four-term [[Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division)|Liberal]] MP [[Tom Mead]], and serving until 1984. He had previously made an unsuccessful bid for the seat in 1973.<ref name=nsw>{{cite NSW Parliament |title =Mr Kevin James Ryan (1934- ) |id=1922 |former=Yes |accessdate=13 May 2019 }}</ref> Ryan was defeated by Liberal candidate [[Guy Yeomans]] at the [[1984 New South Wales state election|1984 New South Wales Legislative Assembly election]]. The result was considered a minor upset as Labor comfortably won the election overall. Ryan's critics within the Labor Party suggested that he had failed to nurse the electorate sufficiently. Ryan contested the [[1987 Bankstown state by-election|1987 Bankstown by-election]] as an independent in opposition to the official Labor candidate. He polled 18.6% but was third behind the Labor candidate [[Doug Shedden (politician)|Doug Shedden]].<ref name=\"Green Bankstown 1987 by-election\">{{cite web |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |title=1987 results Bankstown by-election |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/electionresults18562007/1984/Bankstown_1.htm |work=New South Wales Election Results 1856-2007 |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref> He contested the electorate again as an independent at the [[1988 New South Wales state election|1988 election]] but was again defeated with 18.7% of the vote.<ref name=\"Green Bankstown 1988\">{{cite web |first=Antony |last=Green |authorlink=Antony Green |title=1988 results Bankstown |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/electionresults18562007/1988/Bankstown.htm |work=New South Wales Election Results 1856-2007 |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nRyan was President of the Rugby League Players Association for many years and a sports commentator with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] from 1970 to 1973 where he usually worked alongside Alan Marks commentating on NSWRFL games. {{As of|2019}} he still practises as a [[barrister]] at the Selborne Chambers in Sydney.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr K J Ryan |url=http://find-a-barrister.nswbar.asn.au/profile/kevin-ryan-1189 |work=Find-a Barrister |publisher=NSW Bar Association |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nIn 2000 Ryan was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]].

Despite launching three assaults, the Chetniks failed to capture Novi Pazar.\n\nDuring World War II, the territory of Sand\u017eak was the subject of territorial disputes between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], as well as the local [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] populations. Due to the multiple insurgent, ethnic and religious groups in the region, persecution and genocide of [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] characterised the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|conflict in Yugoslavia]].\n\n== Background ==\n=== Axis invasion of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main article|Axis invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 and within several days, it was conquered by Axis forces. On 17 April, German troops, the [[60th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|60th Infantry Division]] and the [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]], captured the city of Novi Pazar. Yugoslavia was then partitioned between the Axis powers. On April 23, it was agreed that the city would fall within the German occupation zone.\n\n=== Uprisings in Montenegro and Serbia ===\n{{Main article|Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|Uprising in Serbia (1941)}}\nThe [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|Uprising in Montenegro]] occurred on 13 July 1941 and spread into areas of Sand\u017eak.

This had direct consequence to Chetnik-Partisan cooperation at Novi Pazar where Partisan forces left their positions to fill the gap at Kraljevo.{{Sfn|\u0106ukovi\u0107|1964|p=172<!-- |ps=\"\u0428\u0442\u0430\u0431 \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043e\u0442\u0442\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430, \u0443\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0446\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0433\u0446\u0430\u2014\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0435\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0408\u0448\u043e\u0433 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0428\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0435\u043c. \u041e\u0431\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u041a\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435\u2014\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0411\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e.... \u0417\u0431\u043e\u0433 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0458\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430. \u0428\u0442\u0430\u0431 \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0443\u043a\u0443 \u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0447\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0443 \u0420\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435, \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0443 \u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u045b \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0430.-->}}\n\nChetniks attacked the town on 4 November at 4 a.m. They managed to advance toward the town until 7 a.m. when the rear flanks of one Chetnik unit were attacked by Muslim forces under command of [[Biko Dre\u0161ovi\u0107]], [[D\u017eemail Koni\u010danin]] and [[Mullah Jakup]]. This caused dismay of this Chetnik unit which retreated from already captured positions.

A number of guns, machine guns and ammunition was also brought into the town. This encouraged Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 to try to expand borders of the Greater Albania by capturing Chetnik controlled [[Ra\u0161ka, Serbia|Ra\u0161ka]]. To buy some time Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 concluded peace agreement with Chetniks on 10 November 1941. According to this agreement Muslims guaranteed safety to Serbs while Chetniks guaranteed safety to Muslims who lived on the territory under their control.{{Sfn|\u0106ukovi\u0107|1964|p=174}} During next couple of days additional Albanian and Muslim forces arrived to Novi Pazar. On 14 November Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107 had around 5,000 armed men and made decision to attack Ra\u0161ka and burn all Serb villages in the region. On 15 November his forces began with burning of numerous Serb villages and killed many people.\n\nOn 16 November at 10 a.m. Muslim and Albanian forces attacked Ra\u0161ka.

Bonetti was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the [[nickname]], ''\"The Cat\"''. He was one of several goalkeepers ([[Gordon West]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.\n\nBonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to [[Gordon Banks]]. Bonetti was part of the winning England squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but did not play. He belatedly received a winners' medal in 2009, after [[the Football Association]] led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3\u20132 to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]].he was a man\n\n==Early life==\nIn 1948 Bonetti's family moved from [[London]] to [[Worthing]] on the [[Sussex]] coast.

Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for [[Croydon F.C.|Croydon Amateurs]] in the [[Surrey Senior League]] thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating 60 years of Croydon FC|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Celebrating-60-years-Croydon-FC/story-19762019-detail/story.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|work=Croydon Advertiser|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> He made his first team debut in 1960 and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth side win the [[FA Youth Cup]]. From the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season onwards, he was Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper, a position he held more or less constantly for the next nineteen years. Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of [[Tommy Docherty]] as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young side which included [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Terry Venables]], [[John Hollins]] and [[Barry Bridges]]. The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1\u20130, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny [[George Mulhall]] and maintain his side's promotion chances; a 7\u20130 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] secured instant promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].\n[[File:1965\u201366 Fairs Cup - AC Milan v Chelsea FC - Rivera scores.jpg|thumb|left|Bonetti (no. 1) with Chelsea, while vainly trying to oppose the shot of A.C. Milan's [[Gianni Rivera|Rivera]] during the away defeat at [[San Siro]] valid for the [[1965\u201366 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], 3rd round.]]\n\nThe new Chelsea side challenged for honours during the 1960s, with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. Chelsea won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] with a 3\u20132 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at [[Filbert Street]], but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0\u20130 draw for his side and thus the trophy. For most of the same season, Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the [[FA Cup]] but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup while the title challenge was ended with a few games left after a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players \u2013 though not Bonetti \u2013 meaning that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in which Bonetti conceded six goals.\n\nBonetti played in every game of Chelsea's [[Fairs Cup]] run the following season, putting in a series of impressive displays against the likes of [[AS Roma]], [[AC Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]], though the side were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of [[Alex Stepney]] at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper and he considered putting in a [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] request, but Stepney ultimately played only one game for the club and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2\u20131.\n\nThat was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by [[Dave Sexton]]. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the [[FA Cup Final 1970|FA Cup final]] and this time faced reigning league champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Over the two fiercely contested games, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]], his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]]. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]], and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in [[extra time]] to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] awards.\n\nA year later, the team added the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] after another replayed win in the final, this time over Spanish giants [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea took a 2\u20130 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti, which helped them hold on for a 2\u20131 win. <ref name=\"Constable2014\">{{cite book|author=Nick Constable|title=Match of the Day: 50 Years of Football|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZS9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81|date=15 September 2014|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-4253-8|pages=81\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThat was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and in the semi-finals of the same competition to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a year later. Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success.\n\n===St Louis Stars===\nBonetti left on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] in 1975, joining the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL).

Bonetti was known for his safe handling, lightning reflexes and his graceful style, for which he was given the [[nickname]], ''\"The Cat\"''. He was one of several goalkeepers ([[Gordon West]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] was another) who specialised in a one-armed throw which could achieve a similar distance to a drop kick.\n\nBonetti played seven times for England, but mainly served the team as a back-up to [[Gordon Banks]]. Bonetti was part of the winning England squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]], but did not play. He belatedly received a winners' medal in 2009, after [[the Football Association]] led a successful campaign for non-playing members of the squad to be recognised. After Banks fell ill before the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, Bonetti played as England lost 3\u20132 to [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn 1948 Bonetti's family moved from [[London]] to [[Worthing]] on the [[Sussex]] coast. His parents ran a cafe on the seafront next to the [[Dome Cinema|Worthing Dome]]. They were Swiss emigrants to England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/12/peter-bonetti-obituary|title=Peter Bonetti obituary|first=Brian|last=Glanville|date=12 April 2020|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Bonetti shone at an early age, playing for [[Worthing F.C.|Worthing]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Chelsea===\nChelsea signed him from the [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] youth team after his mother had written to then manager [[Ted Drake]], requesting that he give her son a trial. Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for [[Croydon F.C.|Croydon Amateurs]] in the [[Surrey Senior League]] thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Celebrating 60 years of Croydon FC|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Celebrating-60-years-Croydon-FC/story-19762019-detail/story.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|work=Croydon Advertiser|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> He made his first team debut in 1960 and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth side win the [[FA Youth Cup]]. From the [[1960-61 in English football|1960\u201361]] season onwards, he was Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper, a position he held more or less constantly for the next nineteen years. Chelsea were relegated in Bonetti's second full season, which saw the appointment of [[Tommy Docherty]] as manager. Bonetti emerged as a key figure in a talented young side which included [[Bobby Tambling]], [[Terry Venables]], [[John Hollins]] and [[Barry Bridges]]. The team went into the penultimate match of the season needing to beat promotion rivals [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]] to have a chance of going up. Chelsea won 1\u20130, with Bonetti making a brilliant last minute save to deny [[George Mulhall]] and maintain his side's promotion chances; a 7\u20130 win over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] secured instant promotion back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].\n[[File:1965\u201366 Fairs Cup - AC Milan v Chelsea FC - Rivera scores.jpg|thumb|left|Bonetti (no. 1) with Chelsea, while vainly trying to oppose the shot of A.C. Milan's [[Gianni Rivera|Rivera]] during the away defeat at [[San Siro]] valid for the [[1965\u201366 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]], 3rd round.]]\n\nThe new Chelsea side challenged for honours during the 1960s, with Bonetti a key figure throughout, although more often than not the team narrowly missed out. Chelsea won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in [[Football League Cup Final 1965|1965]] with a 3\u20132 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Leicester put Chelsea under heavy pressure in the second leg at [[Filbert Street]], but an inspired performance from Bonetti helped secure a 0\u20130 draw for his side and thus the trophy. For most of the same season, Chelsea were on course to add both the league title and the [[FA Cup]] but ultimately missed out. They were beaten by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the FA Cup while the title challenge was ended with a few games left after a bust-up between Docherty and several of his first-team players \u2013 though not Bonetti \u2013 meaning that a much-weakened team was fielded in a key match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], in which Bonetti conceded six goals.\n\nBonetti played in every game of Chelsea's [[Fairs Cup]] run the following season, putting in a series of impressive displays against the likes of [[AS Roma]], [[AC Milan]] and [[FC Barcelona]], though the side were eventually knocked out in the semi-finals, as they were in the FA Cup for the second consecutive year. The signing of [[Alex Stepney]] at the end of that season briefly threatened his position as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper and he considered putting in a [[Transfer (football)|transfer]] request, but Stepney ultimately played only one game for the club and was sold to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] a few months later. Chelsea eventually reached an FA Cup final in 1967, where they faced [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], but the team got outplayed on the day and Bonetti could do little to stop Spurs winning 2\u20131.\n\nThat was the closest he came to winning another trophy with Chelsea until 1970, by which time Docherty had been succeeded by [[Dave Sexton]]. In 1970, Chelsea again reached the [[FA Cup Final 1970|FA Cup final]] and this time faced reigning league champions [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. Over the two fiercely contested games, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]], his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' [[Mick Jones (footballer, born 1945)|Mick Jones]]. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both [[Peter Lorimer]] and [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]], and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in [[extra time]] to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] awards.\n\nA year later, the team added the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] after another replayed win in the final, this time over Spanish giants [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]]. Chelsea took a 2\u20130 lead in the replay, but Real dominated for much of the second half and it was another inspired performance from Bonetti, which helped them hold on for a 2\u20131 win. <ref name=\"Constable2014\">{{cite book|author=Nick Constable|title=Match of the Day: 50 Years of Football|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZS9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT81|date=15 September 2014|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4481-4253-8|pages=81\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThat was his last trophy with the club, although they narrowly missed out on more in the following years, losing in the 1972 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and in the semi-finals of the same competition to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a year later. Financial and disciplinary problems within the club prevented them from building on their success.\n\n===St Louis Stars===\nBonetti left on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]] in 1975, joining the [[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|St. Louis Stars]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL).

There are also around 100 in the Channel Islands, primarily in [[Jersey]]. According to some sources,<ref>[https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/manx-jews-cling-on-to-island-life-1.57149]</ref> there are around 200 Jews on the Isle of Man, although unlike Jersey and Northern Ireland, there is no synagogue. The majority of the Jews in England and the UK live in and around London, with almost 160,000 Jews in London alone, and a further 21,000 just in Hertfordshire, mostly in Southwestern Hertfordshire, with some in south-west [[Essex]]. Barnet and Hertsmere councils in the London borders polled as the first and second most Jewish local authorities in England, with Jews composing one in five and nine residents respectively. The next most significant population is in Greater Manchester, a community of slightly more than 25,000, primarily in Bury (10,360),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/bury | title=Bury Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Salford (7,920),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/salford | title=Salford Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Manchester proper (2,725)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/manchester | title=Manchester Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> and Trafford (2,490).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/trafford | title=Trafford Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> There are also significant communities in Leeds (6,760),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/yorkshire-and-the-humber/leeds | title=Leeds Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Gateshead (3,000),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-east/gateshead | title=Gateshead Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Brighton (2,730),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/south-east/brighton-and-hove | title=Brighton and Hove Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Liverpool (2,330),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/liverpool | title=Liverpool Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Birmingham (2,150)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/west-midlands/birmingham | title=Birmingham Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> and [[Southend]] (2,080).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/east-of-england/southend-on-sea | title=Southend-on-Sea Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Towns and villages in Hertfordshire with large absolute populations include [[Bushey]] (4,500), [[Borehamwood]] (3,900), and [[Radlett]] (2,300).

The next most significant population is in Greater Manchester, a community of slightly more than 25,000, primarily in Bury (10,360),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/bury | title=Bury Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Salford (7,920),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/salford | title=Salford Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Manchester proper (2,725)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/manchester | title=Manchester Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> and Trafford (2,490).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/trafford | title=Trafford Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> There are also significant communities in Leeds (6,760),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/yorkshire-and-the-humber/leeds | title=Leeds Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Gateshead (3,000),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-east/gateshead | title=Gateshead Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Brighton (2,730),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/south-east/brighton-and-hove | title=Brighton and Hove Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Liverpool (2,330),<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/north-west/liverpool | title=Liverpool Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Birmingham (2,150)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/west-midlands/birmingham | title=Birmingham Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> and [[Southend]] (2,080).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://localstats.co.uk/census-demographics/england/east-of-england/southend-on-sea | title=Southend-on-Sea Census Demographics United Kingdom}}</ref> Towns and villages in Hertfordshire with large absolute populations include [[Bushey]] (4,500), [[Borehamwood]] (3,900), and [[Radlett]] (2,300).

Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nThe Communal Security Trust (CST) was formed in 1994 to \"[protect] British Jews from antisemitism and related threats\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cst.org.uk/about-cst|title=About CST \u2013 CST \u2013 Protecting Our Jewish Community|website=cst.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the police and other authorities to protect Jewish schools, Synagogues, and other community institutions.\n\nWhile records of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.\n\n==Communal institutions==\n<!--more specific inclusion criteria useful: include only Jewish orgs based in UK that have articles (no redlinks or EXT), sorted alphabetically, these can be found in [[Category:Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom]] (and sub cats), and other cats-->\nBritish Jewish communal organisations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]]\n* [[Association of Jewish Refugees]]\n* [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] (1760)\n* [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]]\n* [[Community Security Trust]]\n* [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]\n* [[Jewish Book Week|Jewish Book Council]]\n* [[Jewish Care]]\n* [[Jewish Council for Racial Equality]]\n* [[Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain]]\n* [[Jewish Leadership Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejlc.org/members|title=Members|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[JW3]] \u2013 a London venue\n* [[Kisharon]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[League of Jewish Women]]\n* [[Leo Baeck Institute London]]\n* [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]]\n* [[Limmud]]\n* [[London Jewish Forum]]\n* [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]]\n* [[Maccabaeans]]\n* [[Mitzvah Day International]]\n* [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]]\n* [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]]\n* [[Tzelem]]\n* [[UCL Institute of Jewish Studies]]\n* [[UK Jewish Film Festival]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[United Restitution Organization]]\n* [[United Synagogue]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Women]]\n* [[World Jewish Relief]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Judaism}}\n* [[List of British Jews]]\n* [[List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Jews in England]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Scotland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group= n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |title= Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |archivedate= 22 August 2013 }}&nbsp;{{small|(430&nbsp;KB)}}.
