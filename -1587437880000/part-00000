The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus' order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point? Because situations may require him to do things and turn a blind eye to things that Jimmy McGill would not be able to stomach.<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\">{{Cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |title='Better Call Saul' creator on what lies ahead in season 5&nbsp;\u2013 and the return of Gene |date=December 12, 2018 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=December 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213021058/https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |archive-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nMain cast members [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] return from previous seasons as Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman, [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], [[Kim Wexler]],<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Howard Hamlin]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |title='Better Call Saul' star Patrick Fabian on the evolution of Howard, his soft spot for Rhea Seehorn and what to expect from season 5 |last=Pai |first=Akshay |date=November 13, 2018 |website=Meaww |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224034537/https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Nacho Varga]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |title=Michael Mando Is Living a Real Life Hollywood Fairy Tale |last=Scott |first=Savannah |date=December 11, 2018 |website=L'Officiel |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224033938/https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gus Fring]].<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Tony Dalton]], who recurred in season four as [[Lalo Salamanca]], was promoted to the main cast for the fifth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |title='Better Call Saul' Adds Tony Dalton As Series Regular For Season 5 |last=Ramos |first=Dino-Ray |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409061114/https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, it was announced that ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' actors [[Dean Norris]] and [[Steven Michael Quezada]] would reprise their roles as [[Hank Schrader]] and [[Steven Gomez]], along with actor [[Robert Forster]] who appeared posthumously as [[Ed Galbraith]].<ref name=\"BBCharacters\">{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |title='Better Call Saul' season 5 to feature the late Robert Forster, Dean Norris |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=January 16, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117041936/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |archive-date=January 17, 2020 |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> The first episode of the season was dedicated to Forster.<ref name=\"sepinwall\">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-1-magic-man-954059/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season Premiere Recap: \u2018Magic Man\u2019 |date=February 23, 2020 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 23, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fifth season began on April 10, 2019, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |title='Better Call Saul' begins filming season 5 in ABQ |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190414143824/https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/04/09/better-call-saul-season-5-amc-confirms-filming-this-week-patrick-fabian-briefly-talks-howard/ |title='Better Call Saul' Season 5: AMC Confirms Filming Begins This Week;

Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the settlement, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim\u2019s insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo was inspired by a photograph the bank never obtained permission to use. Jimmy pressures Kevin by threatening an injunction against displaying the logo and TV ads seeking plaintiffs for class action suits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets privately with Jimmy and accepts a deal to pay Acker and the photographer. Kim angrily confronts Jimmy, upset that he made her the \"sucker\" for his con. She tells him they need to either break up or get married. Gus, Victor, and Mike meet with Nacho, who reports Lalo's plan to reveal the locations of Gus\u2019s street dealers to the police.

Kim and Rich return, Kim reminds Kevin he ignored their advice, and says that if they continue as his counsel, Kevin should be willing to listen. Kevin concurs and retains them. Mike tells Stacey he has gotten past the problem that caused his recent anger. Nacho tells Mike Lalo wants Nacho to burn down Gus\u2019s restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide updates to Peter, Madrigal's CEO. Afterwards, Gus briefs Peter and Lydia on the meth lab's status. Peter is upset over the delays, but Gus stiffens his resolve. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of [[Los Pollos Hermanos]], then Gus sets it on fire. Saul uses information from Mike to accuse police of fabricating evidence against Lalo. Bail is set at $7 million, which Lalo says he can pay.

Kim says she does not want Jimmy to go, because he is a lawyer not a \u201cbagman\u201d for drug dealers, but he says it will be an easy job. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash to Jimmy, then depart. As Jimmy starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen. They take the money and prepare to kill him but are attacked by an unseen sniper. All but one are killed and the survivor escapes. The shooter is Mike, who drives off with Jimmy and the cash. Jimmy's car breaks down, so they push it over the edge of the road, then walk cross-country to avoid the gunman. They camp overnight, then continue their trek. When Jimmy fails to return, Kim asks Lalo for his location, but Lalo refuses. The gunman continues searching, so Jimmy acts as decoy and draws him in.

Gus realizes the men who ambushed Jimmy were hired by Juan Bolsa to protect Gus\u2019s business. Jimmy lies to Kim about what happened, but Kim realizes the truth after she sees the bullet hole in his coffee mug. Kim quits Schweikart and Cokely to focus on pro bono clients. Mike tells Jimmy his post-traumatic stress will pass with time. Lalo discovers Jimmy's car and returns to Albuquerque instead of waiting for The Cousins to bring him to Mexico. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim's apartment. As Mike trains his sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert walk, then asks about the bullet holes in Jimmy\u2019s car.

Kim accepts 20 pending felonies from the public defender ''pro bono''. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo's back gate at 3 a.m. Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard warns Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. Mike tells Jimmy Lalo will be killed. Lalo introduces Nacho to Eladio. Eladio gives his blessing to Nacho's plans for the Salamanca drug business. Jimmy tells Kim Lalo will be killed.

The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel.

The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]?

Kim says she does not want Jimmy to go, because he is a lawyer not a \u201cbagman\u201d for drug dealers, but he says it will be an easy job. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash to Jimmy, then depart. As Jimmy starts his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen. They take the money and prepare to kill him but are attacked by an unseen sniper. All but one are killed and the survivor escapes. The shooter is Mike, who drives off with Jimmy and the cash. Jimmy's car breaks down, so they push it over the edge of the road, then walk cross-country to avoid the gunman. They camp overnight, then continue their trek. When Jimmy fails to return, Kim asks Lalo for his location, but Lalo refuses. The gunman continues searching, so Jimmy acts as decoy and draws him in. Mike shoots the gunman, whose vehicle flips and is destroyed.

Gus realizes the men who ambushed Jimmy were hired by Juan Bolsa to protect Gus\u2019s business. Jimmy lies to Kim about what happened, but Kim realizes the truth after she sees the bullet hole in his coffee mug. Kim quits Schweikart and Cokely to focus on pro bono clients.

Kim tells Lalo the car was probably destroyed by passersby and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo appears satisfied with Kim's argument and departs.

Kim accepts 20 pending felonies from the public defender ''pro bono''. Nacho receives a call telling him to open Lalo\u2019s back gate at 3 a.m. Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely. Howard warns Kim about Jimmy\u2019s recent harassment and suggests Kim should stop following his lead. Kim says she is insulted by the notion that she cannot decide for herself. Mike tells Jimmy Lalo will be killed. Lalo introduces Nacho to Eladio. Eladio gives his blessing to Nacho\u2019s plans for the Salamanca drug business. Jimmy tells Kim Lalo will be killed.

He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nBorn in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], Graham won election to the [[Florida Legislature]] after graduating from [[Harvard Law School]]. After serving in both houses of the Florida Legislature, Graham won the 1978 Florida gubernatorial election, and was reelected in 1982. In the [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986 Senate elections]], Graham defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Paula Hawkins]]. He helped found the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] and eventually became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]]. Graham ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic presidential nomination]], but dropped out before the first primaries. He declined to seek reelection in 2004 and retired from the Senate.\n\nGraham served as co-chair of the [[National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling|National Commission on the BP ''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling]] and as a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and the CIA External Advisory Board. He works at the [[Bob Graham Center for Public Service]] at his undergraduate alma mater, the [[University of Florida]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[Commission on the Prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism]]. Through the WMD policy center he advocates for the recommendations in the Commission's report, \"World at Risk.\" In 2011, Graham published his first novel, the thriller ''The Keys to the Kingdom''.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/bob-graham-promoting-novel-keys-to-the-kingdom/2011/06/20/AGPlGXjH_story.html Linda Davidson.

Graham (politician)|Ernest R. Graham]], a Florida state senator, mining engineer, and dairy/cattleman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/graham.html|title=Ancestry of Bob Graham|website=www.wargs.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> He is the youngest of four children. His siblings are [[Phil Graham|Philip Graham]], the late publisher of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (1915-1963); William Graham of Miami Lakes, Florida; and Mary Crow. He married [[Adele Khoury Graham|Adele Khoury]], of [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]], in 1959. They have four daughters, [[Gwen Graham]], Cissy Graham McCullough, Suzanne Graham Gibson and Kendall Graham Elias and 11 grandchildren.\n\nBob Graham attended [[Miami High School (Miami, Florida)|Miami Senior High School]] from 1952 to 1955; he was student body president his senior year. He was International Trustee of the [[Key Club]], the [[Kiwanis]] service organization. While at Miami High Graham was the recipient of the Sigma Chi Award, the school's highest honor. He received a bachelor's degree in 1959 in political science from the [[University of Florida]], where he was a member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity and was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the University of Florida Hall of Fame and [[Florida Blue Key]]. He went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1962. His eldest brother, Philip (1915\u20131963), was also a Harvard Law School alum.\n\n==Political career==\nGraham was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1966 and reelected in 1967 and 1968, each time representing all of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]. He was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] in 1970, also from Dade County. [[Redistricting|Redistricted]] into a seat encompassing portions of northern Dade and southern [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Graham was reelected to District 33 in 1972 and 1976.\n\n===Governor of Florida===\n[[File:Florida Governor-elect Graham being sworn in by Chief Justice Arthur England.jpg|thumb|right|Graham being sworn in as [[Governor of Florida]] in January 1979]]\nBob Graham was elected Governor of Florida in 1978 after a seven-way Democratic primary race in which he initially placed second to [[Robert L. Shevin]]. His supporters at the time dubbed themselves \"[[Florida Cracker|Graham crackers]].\" With this victory, he realized his father's dream: Cap Graham had run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to be Governor of Florida back in 1944.  Graham was re-elected in 1982 with 65 percent of the vote, having defeated the  Republican nominee, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Louis A. Bafalis]] of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].\n\nGraham emphasized education, and placed a focus on improvement of the public universities in the state. By the end of his second term the state university system was among the first quartile of state systems in America, and its public schools and community colleges had substantially improved their academic standing.\n\nIn addition, Graham's administration focused on economic diversification and environmental policies.  During his tenure as governor, the state added 1.2&nbsp;million jobs, and for the first time in state history the per capita income of Floridians exceeded the US average.  For three of his eight years Florida was rated by the accounting firm Grant Thornton as having the best business climate of all states in the union.\n\nGraham also launched the most extensive environmental protection program in the state's history, focused on preserving endangered lands.  During his tenure thousands of acres of threatened and environmentally important lands were brought into state ownership for permanent protection.  His keystone accomplishment was the establishment of the Save the Everglades program, which has now been joined by the federal government in a commitment to restore the Everglades.\n\nGraham left the governorship with an 83% approval rating. According to the ''New York Times'', he was one of the most popular politicians in Florida.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nagourney|first1=Adam|title=Senator Graham Considers Run for President |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/24/politics/campaigns/24GRAH.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=24 December 2002}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senator===\nGraham was then elected to the U.S. Senate in [[U.S. Senate election, 1986|1986]], defeating incumbent Sen. [[Paula Hawkins]] 55 to 45 percent. He was reelected in [[U.S. Senate election, 1992|1992]] (over [[James W. Grant|Bill Grant]], 66%\u201334%) and [[U.S. Senate election, 1998|1998]] (over [[Charlie Crist]], 63%\u201337%) and chose not to seek reelection in 2004. Upon retiring from the Senate in January 2005, Graham had served 38 consecutive years in public office.\n\nGraham served 10 years on the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], which he chaired during and after 9/11 and the run-up to the Iraq war. He led the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001|joint congressional investigation into 9/11]]. As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Graham opposed the War in Iraq and was one of the 23 Senators who voted against President Bush's request for authorization of the use of military force. After meeting with military leaders in February 2002, and requesting and reviewing a [[National Intelligence Estimate]], he said he \"felt we were being manipulated and that the result was going to distract us from where our real enemies were\". He continued to oppose the Iraq War, saying in 2008: \"I'm afraid I never wavered from my belief that this was a distraction that was going to come to a bad end in Iraq and an even worse end in Afghanistan\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/17/graham-i-never-wavered-i_n_91844.html |title=Graham: I Never Wavered In My Belief That The War Was Wrong |last=Stein |first=Sam |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Graham published ''Intelligence Matters: The CIA, the FBI, Saudi Arabia and the Failure of America's War on Terror''. In September 2008 the book was released in paperback with a new preface and postscript.\n\nGraham has a well-known habit of meticulously logging his daily activities (some as mundane as when he ate a tuna sandwich or rewound a tape of ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective|Ace Ventura]]''<ref>Tapper, Jake. \"[http://www.salon.com/2003/06/03/graham_7/ '1:30-1:45: Rewind Ace Ventura']\".

The notebooks are now housed at the University of Florida library. A great advocate for his home state, Graham always kept Florida orange juice on hand in his Senate office and was rarely seen without his trademark Florida tie.\n\n===Presidential and Vice Presidential politics===\nGraham was considered as a Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2004.<ref>[http://www.politics1.com/dems04.htm Politics1 \u2013 Guide to the Inactive 2004 Democratic Presidential Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223015/http://politics1.com/dems04.htm|date=May 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB133DF933A25754C0A964958260 The 1992 Campaign: Democrats; Clinton Selects Senator Gore of Tennessee as Running Mate \u2013 New York Times]</ref> He was a finalist on [[Bill Clinton]]'s shortlist of running mates in 1992, and was reportedly on [[Al Gore]]'s shortlist in 2000.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html Gore, Lieberman prepare for public debut of Democratic ticket \u2013 August 7, 2000<!--Bot-generated title-->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813055539/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html|date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====2004 Presidential election====\n{{Main|Bob Graham 2004 presidential campaign}}\nIn December 2002 Graham announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]]. On January 31, 2003, he had open-heart surgery and his campaign faltered. He withdrew his candidacy on October 7, 2003. In November, he announced that he would not seek another term in the Senate. After [[John Kerry]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in March 2004, some discussed the possibility that Graham would be on the [[short list|shortlist]] of Kerry's choices for running mate.\n\n==After politics==\n[[File:Former senator Bob Graham 2.jpg|thumb|Former Senator Graham (center), with former Florida Governor [[Buddy MacKay]] (right) at the dedication ceremony for Pugh Hall, home of the Graham Center for Public Service at the University of Florida.]]\nAfter teaching at Harvard University for the 2005\u201306 academic year, Graham focused on founding a center to train future political leaders, at the [[University of Florida]]{{spaced ndash}}where he earned his bachelor's degree in political science in 1959.\n\nThe UF Center, known as the [[Bob Graham Center for Public Service]], is housed in the university's [[University of Florida College of Liberal Arts and Sciences|College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]]. The Center provides students with opportunities to train for future leadership positions, and the university community to engage with policy makers and scholars.

He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].\n\nBorn in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], Graham won election to the [[Florida Legislature]] after graduating from [[Harvard Law School]]. After serving in both houses of the Florida Legislature, Graham won the 1978 Florida gubernatorial election, and was reelected in 1982. In the [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986 Senate elections]], Graham defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Paula Hawkins]]. He helped found the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] and eventually became Chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]]. Graham ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic presidential nomination]], but dropped out before the first primaries. He declined to seek reelection in 2004 and retired from the Senate.\n\nGraham served as co-chair of the [[National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling|National Commission on the BP ''Deepwater Horizon'' Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling]] and as a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and the CIA External Advisory Board. He works at the [[Bob Graham Center for Public Service]] at his undergraduate alma mater, the [[University of Florida]]. He also served as Chairman of the [[Commission on the Prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism]]. Through the WMD policy center he advocates for the recommendations in the Commission's report, \"World at Risk.\" In 2011, Graham published his first novel, the thriller ''The Keys to the Kingdom''.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/bob-graham-promoting-novel-keys-to-the-kingdom/2011/06/20/AGPlGXjH_story.html Linda Davidson.

Graham (politician)|Ernest R. Graham]], a Florida state senator, mining engineer, and dairy/cattleman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/graham.html|title=Ancestry of Bob Graham|website=www.wargs.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}</ref> He is the youngest of four children. His siblings are [[Phil Graham|Philip Graham]], the late publisher of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' (1915-1963); William Graham of Miami Lakes, Florida; and Mary Crow. He married [[Adele Khoury Graham|Adele Khoury]], of [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]], in 1959. They have four daughters, [[Gwen Graham]], Cissy Graham McCullough, Suzanne Graham Gibson and Kendall Graham Elias and 11 grandchildren.\n\nBob Graham attended [[Miami High School (Miami, Florida)|Miami Senior High School]] from 1952 to 1955; he was Student Body President his senior year. He was International Trustee of the [[Key Club]], the [[Kiwanis]] service organization. While at Miami High Graham was the recipient of the Sigma Chi Award, the school's highest honor. He received a bachelor's degree in 1959 in political science from the [[University of Florida]], where he was a member of the Epsilon Zeta chapter of [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity and was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the University of Florida Hall of Fame and [[Florida Blue Key]]. He went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1962. His eldest brother, Philip (1915\u20131963), was also a Harvard Law School alum.\n\n==Political career==\nGraham was elected to the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1966 and reelected in 1967 and 1968, each time representing all of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]]. He was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] in 1970, also from Dade County. [[Redistricting|Redistricted]] into a seat encompassing portions of northern Dade and southern [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Graham was reelected to District 33 in 1972 and 1976.\n\n===Governor of Florida===\n[[File:Florida Governor-elect Graham being sworn in by Chief Justice Arthur England.jpg|thumb|right|Graham being sworn in as [[Governor of Florida]] in January 1979]]\nBob Graham was elected Governor of Florida in 1978 after a seven-way Democratic primary race in which he initially placed second to [[Robert L. Shevin]]. His supporters at the time dubbed themselves \"[[Florida Cracker|Graham crackers]].\" With this victory, he realized his father's dream: Cap Graham had run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to be Governor of Florida back in 1944.  Graham was re-elected in 1982 with 65 percent of the vote, having defeated the  Republican nominee, [[U.S. Representative]] [[Louis A. Bafalis]] of [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].\n\nGraham emphasized education, and placed a focus on improvement of the public universities in the state. By the end of his second term the state university system was among the first quartile of state systems in America, and its public schools and community colleges had substantially improved their academic standing.\n\nIn addition, Graham's administration focused on economic diversification and environmental policies.  During his tenure as governor, the state added 1.2&nbsp;million jobs, and for the first time in state history the per capita income of Floridians exceeded the US average.  For three of his eight years Florida was rated by the accounting firm Grant Thornton as having the best business climate of all states in the union.\n\nGraham also launched the most extensive environmental protection program in the state's history, focused on preserving endangered lands.  During his tenure thousands of acres of threatened and environmentally important lands were brought into state ownership for permanent protection.  His keystone accomplishment was the establishment of the Save the Everglades program, which has now been joined by the federal government in a commitment to restore the Everglades.\n\nGraham left the governorship with an 83% approval rating. According to the ''New York Times'', he was one of the most popular politicians in Florida.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nagourney|first1=Adam|title=Senator Graham Considers Run for President |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/24/politics/campaigns/24GRAH.html|accessdate=9 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=24 December 2002}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senator===\nGraham was then elected to the U.S. Senate in [[U.S. Senate election, 1986|1986]], defeating incumbent Sen. [[Paula Hawkins]] 55 to 45 percent. He was reelected in [[U.S. Senate election, 1992|1992]] (over [[James W. Grant|Bill Grant]], 66%\u201334%) and [[U.S. Senate election, 1998|1998]] (over [[Charlie Crist]], 63%\u201337%) and chose not to seek reelection in 2004. Upon retiring from the Senate in January 2005, Graham had served 38 consecutive years in public office.\n\nGraham served 10 years on the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], which he chaired during and after 9/11 and the run-up to the Iraq war. He led the [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001|joint congressional investigation into 9/11]]. As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Graham opposed the War in Iraq and was one of the 23 Senators who voted against President Bush's request for authorization of the use of military force. After meeting with military leaders in February 2002, and requesting and reviewing a [[National Intelligence Estimate]], he said he \"felt we were being manipulated and that the result was going to distract us from where our real enemies were\". He continued to oppose the Iraq War, saying in 2008: \"I'm afraid I never wavered from my belief that this was a distraction that was going to come to a bad end in Iraq and an even worse end in Afghanistan\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/17/graham-i-never-wavered-i_n_91844.html |title=Graham: I Never Wavered In My Belief That The War Was Wrong |last=Stein |first=Sam |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Graham published ''Intelligence Matters: The CIA, the FBI, Saudi Arabia and the Failure of America's War on Terror''. In September 2008 the book was released in paperback with a new preface and postscript.\n\nGraham has a well-known habit of meticulously logging his daily activities (some as mundane as when he ate a tuna sandwich or rewound a tape of ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective|Ace Ventura]]''<ref>Tapper, Jake. \"[http://www.salon.com/2003/06/03/graham_7/ '1:30-1:45: Rewind Ace Ventura']\".

The notebooks are now housed at the University of Florida library. A great advocate for his home state, Graham always kept Florida orange juice on hand in his Senate office and was rarely seen without his trademark Florida tie.\n\n===Presidential and Vice Presidential politics===\nGraham was considered as a Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2004.<ref>[http://www.politics1.com/dems04.htm Politics1 \u2013 Guide to the Inactive 2004 Democratic Presidential Prospects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515223015/http://politics1.com/dems04.htm|date=May 15, 2008}}</ref><ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB133DF933A25754C0A964958260 The 1992 Campaign: Democrats; Clinton Selects Senator Gore of Tennessee as Running Mate \u2013 New York Times]</ref> He was a finalist on [[Bill Clinton]]'s shortlist of running mates in 1992, and was reportedly on [[Al Gore]]'s shortlist in 2000.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html Gore, Lieberman prepare for public debut of Democratic ticket \u2013 August 7, 2000<!--Bot-generated title-->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813055539/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html|date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====2004 Presidential election====\n{{Main|Bob Graham 2004 presidential campaign}}\nIn December 2002 Graham announced his candidacy for President of the United States in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]].

The free proton is stable. Neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, however, depending on the [[nuclide]]. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons, or vice versa, is governed by the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.\n\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|150px|right|Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.]]\nProtons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of [[isospin]], in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the [[binding energy]] of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. [[Nuclear reaction]]s (such as [[nuclear fission]]) therefore have an [[energy density]] that is more than ten million times that of [[chemical reaction]]s. Because of the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], nuclear binding energies reduce the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., [[uranium-235]]) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic [[potential energy]].\n\nThe neutron is classified as a ''[[hadron]]'', because it is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s.

Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).\n[[File:Beta-minus Decay.svg|thumb|360px |A [[schematic]] of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus of an atom]] indicating {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge.<br>\nThe '''inset''' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]\nA very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called \"two-body (neutron) decays\", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the \"two bodies\"). In this type of free neutron decay, almost all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino (the other \"body\"). (The hydrogen atom recoils with a speed of only about (decay energy)/(hydrogen rest energy) times the speed of light, or 250&nbsp;km/s.)\n\nThe transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton. But a high-energy collision of a proton and an electron or neutrino can result in a neutron.\n\n===Bound neutron decay===\n{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}\nWhile a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons within nuclei are stable. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], the protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are a [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] organized into discrete [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up and spin down. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct [[atomic orbital]]s and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a [[photon]], by the exclusion principle.\n\nNeutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by [[beta decay]] as described above. In this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is [[carbon-14]] (6 protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to [[nitrogen-14]] (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about 5,730 years.\n\nInside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via [[inverse beta decay]], if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of a [[positron]] and an electron [[neutrino]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\n\nThe transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through [[electron capture]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\nPositron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus, and quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] when they encounter electrons.\n\n===Competition of beta decay types===\nThree types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay (by [[positron emission]], 18% or by [[electron capture]], 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).\n\n==Intrinsic properties==\n\n===Mass===\nThe mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by [[mass spectrometry]] due to lack of electric charge. However, since the masses of a proton and of a [[deuteron]] can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (<math>B_d</math>) of the single {{val|0.7822|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil kinetic energy (<math>E_{rd}</math>) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy).\n:<math>m_n= m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}</math>\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948. The best modern (1986) values for neutron mass by this technique are provided by Greene, et al.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greene |first1= GL |display-authors= etal |year= 1986 |title= New determination of the deuteron binding energy and the neutron mass |journal= [[Physical Review Letters]]|volume= 56 |issue= 8|pages= 819\u2013822 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.819 |bibcode=1986PhRvL..56..819G |pmid=10033294}}</ref> These give a neutron mass of:\n:''m''<sub>neutron</sub>= {{val|1.008644904|(14)|ul=u}}\n\nThe value for the neutron mass in MeV is less accurately known, due to less accuracy in the known conversion of [[atomic mass unit|u]] to MeV:<ref>Byrne, J.

Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14|title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author=Knoll, Glenn F.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1979|isbn=978-0471495451|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/radiationdetecti00knol_0}}</ref>\n\n===Neutron detection by neutron capture===\nA common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|237}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. <!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.\n\nThe cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a [[neutron moderator]] is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detectors using the moderate-and-capture approach cannot measure neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, because this information is lost during moderation. -->\n\n===Neutron detection by elastic scattering===\nNeutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector. Methods such as pulse shape discrimination can be used in distinguishing neutron signals from gamma-ray signals, although certain inorganic scintillator-based detectors have been developed <ref>{{Cite journal |last = Ghosh |first = P. |author2= W.

Their half-life is still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them continuously.\n\n'''Natural neutron background.''' A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the \"neutron background\" is caused by [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]] interaction with the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of [[dark matter]].<ref name=\"NatNeu\"/> Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.<ref name=\"KohnEbert\">{{cite journal|last1=K\u00f6hn |first1=C. |last2=Ebert |first2=U. |title=Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres]]|date=2015 |volume=23 |issue=4 |doi=10.1002/2014JD022229 |pages=1620\u20131635|bibcode=2015JGRD..120.1620K |url=https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23845/23845D.pdf }}</ref> Recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10<sup>\u22129</sup> and 10<sup>\u221213</sup> per ms and per m<sup>2</sup> depending on the detection altitude.

These include certain types of [[radioactive decay]] ([[spontaneous fission]] and [[neutron emission]]), and from certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.\n\nIn practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces [[photoneutron]]s on interaction of the high-energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]].

Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s. These methods have little effect on neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the [[neutron magnetic moment|neutron's magnetic moment]].

[[Thermal neutron]]s can be polarized by transmission through [[magnet]]ic materials in a method analogous to the [[Faraday effect]] for [[photon]]s.

For example, neutron capture often results in [[neutron activation]], inducing [[radioactivity]]. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[nuclear fission|fissioning]] of elements like [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] is caused by their absorption of neutrons.\n\n[[Neutron temperature|''Cold'', ''thermal'', and ''hot'']] [[neutron radiation]] is commonly employed in [[neutron scattering]] facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses [[X-ray]]s for the analysis of [[condensed matter]]. Neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]]; sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and deep penetration into matter.\n\nThe development of \"neutron lenses\" based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray tomography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kumakhov |first=M.A. |author2=Sharov, V.A. |year=1992 |title=A neutron lens |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=357 |issue= 6377|pages=390\u2013391 |doi=10.1038/357390a0 |bibcode= 1992Natur.357..390K}}</ref><ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news599.html Physorg.com, \"New Way of 'Seeing': A 'Neutron Microscope'\"].

This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.\n\nAnother use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.\n\n==Medical therapies==\n{{Main|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}\nBecause neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive, however. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.\n\nFast neutron therapy utilizes high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.<ref>Hall EJ (2000). ''Radiobiology for the Radiologist''. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 5th edition</ref> Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]].<ref>Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). ''The Physics of Radiology''. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition</ref>\n\nBeams of low-energy neutrons are used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million (10<sup>9</sup>) neutrons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.\n\n==Protection==\nExposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density makes for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.\n\nHydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] affects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.{{clarify|reason=A step of logic is missing here. Are the neutrons needed to make something fission? Why is so much water used if it is too much?|date=May 2015}} The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].\n\n==Neutron temperature==\n{{Main|Neutron temperature}}\n\n===Thermal neutrons===\n''Thermal neutrons'' are [[free neutron]]s whose energies have a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] with kT&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&nbsp;km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see ''[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]'' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10\u201320) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.\n\nIn many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier \u2013 and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] \u2013 [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.\n\nMost [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or ''thermalize'' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.\n\n===Cold neutrons===\n''Cold neutrons'' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a ''cold source'' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are particularly valuable for [[neutron scattering]] experiments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Cold Neutron Source.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid hydrogen]]\n\n===Ultracold neutrons===\n[[Ultracold neutrons]] are produced by elastically scattering cold neutrons in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid [[deuterium]] or superfluid [[helium]]. An alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons.\n\n===Fission energy neutrons===\n{{Main|Nuclear fission}}\nA ''fast neutron'' is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to {{val|1|ul=MeV}} ({{val|1.6|e=-13|ul=J}}), hence a speed of ~{{val|14000|u=km/s}} (~{{hsp}}5% of the speed of light). They are named ''fission energy'' or ''fast'' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for <sup>235</sup>U fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th).\n\nFast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]]. In reactors, typically [[heavy water]], [[light water reactor|light water]], or [[graphite]] are used to moderate neutrons.\n\n===Fusion neutrons===\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The D\u2013T rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\n{{Details|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}\n\nD\u2013T ([[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1&nbsp;[[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D\u2013T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1&nbsp;MeV that will be produced.\n\n14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D\u2013T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].\n\nOn the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively utilizes D\u2013T fusion 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.\n\nOther fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D\u2013D fusion produces a 2.45&nbsp;MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion produces no neutron.\n\n===Intermediate-energy neutrons===\n[[File:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]\nA fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.\n\n[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range.\nThese are of less significance in a [[fast neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides.\nHowever, in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.\n\nRatios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.\n\n===High-energy neutrons===\nHigh-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-ray]]s or protons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |title= Facing up to secondary neutrons |accessdate= 2011-02-08 |author= Freeman, Tami |date= May 23, 2008 |publisher= Medical Physics Web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220151101/http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |archive-date= 2010-12-20 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space |journal= [[Radiation Protection Dosimetry]]|year= 2005 |volume= 116 |issue= 1\u20134 |pages= 140\u2013143 |doi=10.1093/rpd/nci033 |pmid= 16604615 |last1= Heilbronn |first1= L. |last2= Nakamura |first2= T |last3= Iwata |first3= Y |last4= Kurosawa |first4= T |last5= Iwase |first5= H |last6= Townsend |first6= LW|url= http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[Isotope]]\n* [[List of particles]]\n* [[Neutron magnetic moment]]\n* [[Neutron radiation]] and the [[Sievert|Sievert radiation scale]]\n* [[Neutronium]]\n* [[Nuclear reaction]]\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[Neutron capture nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[R-process]]\n** [[S-process]]\n* [[Thermal reactor]]\n\n===Neutron sources===\n* [[Neutron generator]]\n* [[Neutron source]]\n\n===Processes involving neutrons===\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\n* [[Neutron diffraction]]\n* [[Neutron flux]]\n* [[Neutron transport]]\n* [[Cosmogenic radionuclide dating]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* James Byrne, ''Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons''.

The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.]]\nProtons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of [[isospin]], in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the [[binding energy]] of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. [[Nuclear reaction]]s (such as [[nuclear fission]]) therefore have an [[energy density]] that is more than ten million times that of [[chemical reaction]]s. Because of the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], nuclear binding energies reduce the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., [[uranium-235]]) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic [[potential energy]].\n\nThe neutron is classified as a ''[[hadron]]'', because it is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s.

Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).\n[[File:Beta-minus Decay.svg|thumb|360px |A [[schematic]] of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus of an atom]] indicating {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}} radiation, the emission of a fast electron from the nucleus (the accompanying antineutrino is omitted). In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge.<br>\nThe '''inset''' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]\nA very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called \"two-body (neutron) decays\", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the \"two bodies\"). In this type of free neutron decay, almost all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino (the other \"body\"). (The hydrogen atom recoils with a speed of only about (decay energy)/(hydrogen rest energy) times the speed of light, or 250&nbsp;km/s.)\n\nThe transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton. But a high-energy collision of a proton and an electron or neutrino can result in a neutron.\n\n===Bound neutron decay===\n{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}\nWhile a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons within nuclei are stable. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], the protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are a [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] organized into discrete [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up and spin down. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct [[atomic orbital]]s and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a [[photon]], by the exclusion principle.\n\nNeutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by [[beta decay]] as described above. In this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is [[carbon-14]] (6 protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to [[nitrogen-14]] (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about 5,730 years.\n\nInside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via [[inverse beta decay]], if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of a [[positron]] and an electron [[neutrino]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\n\nThe transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through [[electron capture]]:\n:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}\nPositron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus, and quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] when they encounter electrons.\n\n===Competition of beta decay types===\nThree types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay (by [[positron emission]], 18% or by [[electron capture]], 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).\n\n==Intrinsic properties==\n\n===Mass===\nThe mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by [[mass spectrometry]] due to lack of electric charge. However, since the masses of a proton and of a [[deuteron]] can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (<math>B_d</math>) of the single {{val|0.7822|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil kinetic energy (<math>E_{rd}</math>) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy).\n:<math>m_n= m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}</math>\n\nThe energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948.

Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 14|title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author=Knoll, Glenn F.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1979|isbn=978-0471495451|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/radiationdetecti00knol_0}}</ref>\n\n===Neutron detection by neutron capture===\nA common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|237}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. <!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.\n\nThe cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a [[neutron moderator]] is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detectors using the moderate-and-capture approach cannot measure neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, because this information is lost during moderation. -->\n\n===Neutron detection by elastic scattering===\nNeutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector. Methods such as pulse shape discrimination can be used in distinguishing neutron signals from gamma-ray signals, although certain inorganic scintillator-based detectors have been developed <ref>{{Cite journal |last = Ghosh |first = P. |author2= W.

Their half-life is still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them continuously.\n\n'''Natural neutron background.''' A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the \"neutron background\" is caused by [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]] interaction with the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of [[dark matter]].<ref name=\"NatNeu\"/> Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.<ref name=\"KohnEbert\">{{cite journal|last1=K\u00f6hn |first1=C. |last2=Ebert |first2=U. |title=Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres]]|date=2015 |volume=23 |issue=4 |doi=10.1002/2014JD022229 |pages=1620\u20131635|bibcode=2015JGRD..120.1620K |url=https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/23845/23845D.pdf }}</ref> Recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10<sup>\u22129</sup> and 10<sup>\u221213</sup> per ms and per m<sup>2</sup> depending on the detection altitude.

These include certain types of [[radioactive decay]] ([[spontaneous fission]] and [[neutron emission]]), and from certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.\n\nIn practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces [[photoneutron]]s on interaction of the high-energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]]. A popular [[startup neutron source|source of the latter type]] is radioactive [[antimony-124]] plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then transported to where the neutron source is needed.<ref>Byrne, J.

However, it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy, and converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge.

For access to intense neutron sources, researchers must go to a specialized [[neutron research facility|neutron facility]] that operates a [[research reactor]] or a [[spallation]] source.\n\nThe neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or accelerate them. Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s. These methods have little effect on neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the [[neutron magnetic moment|neutron's magnetic moment]]. Neutrons can be controlled by methods that include [[neutron moderator|moderation]], [[neutron reflector|reflection]], and [[neutron-velocity selector|velocity selection]]. [[Thermal neutron]]s can be polarized by transmission through [[magnet]]ic materials in a method analogous to the [[Faraday effect]] for [[photon]]s. Cold neutrons of wavelengths of 6\u20137 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high degree of polarization, by use of [[neutron supermirror|magnetic mirrors]] and magnetized interference filters.<ref>Byrne, J. ''Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter'', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, p. 453.</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Science with neutrons}}\n\nThe neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions. For example, neutron capture often results in [[neutron activation]], inducing [[radioactivity]]. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[nuclear fission|fissioning]] of elements like [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] is caused by their absorption of neutrons.\n\n[[Neutron temperature|''Cold'', ''thermal'', and ''hot'']] [[neutron radiation]] is commonly employed in [[neutron scattering]] facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses [[X-ray]]s for the analysis of [[condensed matter]]. Neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]]; sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and deep penetration into matter.\n\nThe development of \"neutron lenses\" based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray tomography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kumakhov |first=M.A. |author2=Sharov, V.A. |year=1992 |title=A neutron lens |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=357 |issue= 6377|pages=390\u2013391 |doi=10.1038/357390a0 |bibcode= 1992Natur.357..390K}}</ref><ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news599.html Physorg.com, \"New Way of 'Seeing': A 'Neutron Microscope'\"].

NASA.gov (2007-11-30). Retrieved on 2012-08-16.</ref>\n\nA major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt [[gamma ray]]s from elements in materials. This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.\n\nAnother use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.\n\n==Medical therapies==\n{{Main|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}\nBecause neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive, however. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.\n\nFast neutron therapy utilizes high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.<ref>Hall EJ (2000). ''Radiobiology for the Radiologist''. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 5th edition</ref> Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]].<ref>Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). ''The Physics of Radiology''. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition</ref>\n\nBeams of low-energy neutrons are used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million (10<sup>9</sup>) neutrons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.\n\n==Protection==\nExposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density makes for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.\n\nHydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] affects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.{{clarify|reason=A step of logic is missing here. Are the neutrons needed to make something fission? Why is so much water used if it is too much?|date=May 2015}} The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].\n\n==Neutron temperature==\n{{Main|Neutron temperature}}\n\n===Thermal neutrons===\n''Thermal neutrons'' are [[free neutron]]s whose energies have a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] with kT&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&nbsp;km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see ''[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]'' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10\u201320) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.\n\nIn many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier \u2013 and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] \u2013 [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.\n\nMost [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or ''thermalize'' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.\n\n===Cold neutrons===\n''Cold neutrons'' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a ''cold source'' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are particularly valuable for [[neutron scattering]] experiments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n[[File:Cold Neutron Source.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid hydrogen]]\n\n===Ultracold neutrons===\n[[Ultracold neutrons]] are produced by elastically scattering cold neutrons in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid [[deuterium]] or superfluid [[helium]]. An alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons.\n\n===Fission energy neutrons===\n{{Main|Nuclear fission}}\nA ''fast neutron'' is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to {{val|1|ul=MeV}} ({{val|1.6|e=-13|ul=J}}), hence a speed of ~{{val|14000|u=km/s}} (~{{hsp}}5% of the speed of light). They are named ''fission energy'' or ''fast'' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for <sup>235</sup>U fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as <sup>238</sup>U and <sup>232</sup>Th).\n\nFast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]]. In reactors, typically [[heavy water]], [[light water reactor|light water]], or [[graphite]] are used to moderate neutrons.\n\n===Fusion neutrons===\n[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The D\u2013T rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]\n\n{{Details|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}\n\nD\u2013T ([[deuterium]]\u2013[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1&nbsp;[[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D\u2013T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1&nbsp;MeV that will be produced.\n\n14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D\u2013T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].\n\nOn the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively utilizes D\u2013T fusion 14.1&nbsp;MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.\n\nOther fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D\u2013D fusion produces a 2.45&nbsp;MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. D\u2013<sup>3</sup>He fusion produces no neutron.\n\n===Intermediate-energy neutrons===\n[[File:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]\nA fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.\n\n[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range.\nThese are of less significance in a [[fast neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides.\nHowever, in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.\n\nRatios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.\n\n===High-energy neutrons===\nHigh-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-ray]]s or protons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |title= Facing up to secondary neutrons |accessdate= 2011-02-08 |author= Freeman, Tami |date= May 23, 2008 |publisher= Medical Physics Web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220151101/http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |archive-date= 2010-12-20 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space |journal= [[Radiation Protection Dosimetry]]|year= 2005 |volume= 116 |issue= 1\u20134 |pages= 140\u2013143 |doi=10.1093/rpd/nci033 |pmid= 16604615 |last1= Heilbronn |first1= L. |last2= Nakamura |first2= T |last3= Iwata |first3= Y |last4= Kurosawa |first4= T |last5= Iwase |first5= H |last6= Townsend |first6= LW|url= http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/1nh2s8n5 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Ionizing radiation]]\n* [[Isotope]]\n* [[List of particles]]\n* [[Neutron magnetic moment]]\n* [[Neutron radiation]] and the [[Sievert|Sievert radiation scale]]\n* [[Neutronium]]\n* [[Nuclear reaction]]\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[Neutron capture nucleosynthesis]]\n** [[R-process]]\n** [[S-process]]\n* [[Thermal reactor]]\n\n===Neutron sources===\n* [[Neutron generator]]\n* [[Neutron source]]\n\n===Processes involving neutrons===\n* [[Neutron bomb]]\n* [[Neutron diffraction]]\n* [[Neutron flux]]\n* [[Neutron transport]]\n* [[Cosmogenic radionuclide dating]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* James Byrne, ''Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons''.

He grew up on his family's farm near Sanger and attended local public schools. He attended [[Fresno City College]] before transferring to the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California at Santa Cruz]] from which he earned his degree. He was student body president at Fresno City College in 1968.  In that year he served as Fresno County Co-Chairman of Robert F. Kennedy's California presidential campaign and he was an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nIn 1969 he joined the staff of California State Senator [[George Zenovich]]. In 1976, Lehman was elected to the State Assembly as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming assistant [[majority leader]] by 1978. In 1983, he successfully ran for a seat in Congress, representing a newly created district in Fresno.  He was reelected six times.\n\nLehman was known in Congress for his passionate commitments to important causes such as environmental protection, water policy, and consumer protection. He was able to strike delicate balances on many of these issues, a particularly important skill given the increasingly conservative nature of his [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] district. His notable successes include playing instrumental roles in passage of laws to protect the Kings and Tuolumne Rivers, the [[California Desert Protection Act]], creation of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area and expansions of wilderness areas in the [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Yosemite National Park]]s.\n\nHe served on the Banking Finance and Urban Affairs Committee where he chaired the Consumer Affairs and Coinage sub-committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee where he chaired the Mining and Mineral Affairs subcommittee. He served 12 years on the water and Power subcommittee and received the distinguished service award from the National Water REsources Association in 1990. An avid outdoorsman, he frequented the Sierra back country and successfully climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Kenya in 1991.\n\nLehman's district was made considerably more Republican after the 1990s' round of redistricting.  It was renumbered the 19th District, and pushed further to the north and east, incorporating some more rural territory in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] as well as the more conservative eastern portion of Fresno.

He grew up on his family's farm near Sanger and attended local public schools. He attended [[Fresno City College]] before transferring to the [[University of California, Santa Cruz|University of California at Santa Cruz]] from which he earned his degree. He was Student Body President at Fresno City College in 1968.  In that year he served as Fresno County Co-Chairman of Robert F. Kennedy's California presidential campaign and he was an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nIn 1969 he joined the staff of California State Senator [[George Zenovich]]. In 1976, Lehman was elected to the State Assembly as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming assistant [[majority leader]] by 1978. In 1983, he successfully ran for a seat in Congress, representing a newly created district in Fresno.  He was reelected six times.\n\nLehman was known in Congress for his passionate commitments to important causes such as environmental protection, water policy, and consumer protection. He was able to strike delicate balances on many of these issues, a particularly important skill given the increasingly conservative nature of his [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] district. His notable successes include playing instrumental roles in passage of laws to protect the Kings and Tuolumne Rivers, the [[California Desert Protection Act]], creation of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area and expansions of wilderness areas in the [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Yosemite National Park]]s.\n\nHe served on the Banking Finance and Urban Affairs Committee where he chaired the Consumer Affairs and Coinage sub-committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee where he chaired the Mining and Mineral Affairs subcommittee. He served 12 years on the water and Power subcommittee and received the distinguished service award from the National Water REsources Association in 1990. An avid outdoorsman, he frequented the Sierra back country and successfully climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Kenya in 1991.\n\nLehman's district was made considerably more Republican after the 1990s' round of redistricting.  It was renumbered the 19th District, and pushed further to the north and east, incorporating some more rural territory in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] as well as the more conservative eastern portion of Fresno.  At the same time, he lost his share of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] to the new 11th District, and lost most of his Latino constituents to the neighboring 20th District.  Lehman barely held onto his seat in 1992, winning by only 1,100 votes.  This led to speculation that the 19th would not stay Democratic for long.  In 1994, Lehman was swept from office in the [[Republican Revolution]], losing to Republican [[George Radanovich]] by a 17-point margin\u2014one of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in that cycle.\n\nLehman is currently a partner for the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]-based lobbying firm Lehman Levi Pappas & Sadler . He also serves as a member of the board of the National Parks Trusts, the Mono Lakes Committee, the National council for the Traditional Arts and is on the board of directors of Premier Valley Bank in Fresno.\n\n==External links==\n{{CongBio|L000225}}\n*{{C-SPAN|richardlehman}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box |title=California State Assemblyman, 31st District |before=[[Ernest N.

It currently has four members: the [[Arizona Cardinals]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the [[Seattle Seahawks]].\n\nThe division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Coastal Division, keeping with the theme of having all of the league's divisions starting with the letter \"C.\" The division was so named because its teams were fairly close to the coasts of the United States, although they were on opposite coasts, making for long travel between division rivals. The NFL Coastal Division had four members: [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Baltimore Colts]], Los Angeles Rams, and San Francisco 49ers. Los Angeles and San Francisco occupied the West Coast, while Baltimore maintained its dominance over the lesser teams that remained in the division. Atlanta was placed in the division despite being farther east than three Eastern Conference teams (Cowboys, Cardinals, and Saints). \n\nAfter the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in 1970, the division was renamed the NFC West. The Baltimore Colts moved to the [[AFC East]] and were replaced by the [[New Orleans Saints]], who came from the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference. In 1976, the newly formed [[Seattle Seahawks]] spent one season in this division before moving to the [[AFC West]]. Except for that one year, the division remained the same until 1995 with the addition of the new [[Carolina Panthers]] team.  The Rams moved to St. Louis before that same season, making the division geographically inaccurate.  Ten of the fifteen NFC teams were based west of Atlanta, and twelve of them were based west of Charlotte.\n\nThe 2002 re-alignment changed the entire look of the NFC West. The Falcons, Panthers, and Saints moved into the [[NFC South]]; while the Cardinals moved in from the NFC East and the Seahawks returned from the AFC West. The Rams remained in the West, preserving the historical rivalry with the 49ers that has existed since [[1950 NFL season|1950]], and thus had been the only team in the division that was located east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] until 2015; despite this, the re-alignment made the NFC West have all of its teams based west of the [[Mississippi River]]. With the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, the entire NFC West is now located west of the Rockies for the first time in its history; all teams except for the Cardinals are based in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (since most of [[Arizona]] does not observe [[Daylight Savings Time]], the clocks are the same as Pacific Daylight Time from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday of November). \n\nThe NFC West became the second division since the 2002 realignment (The NFC South was the first) to have each of its teams make a conference championship game appearance as well as a Super Bowl appearance: Los Angeles (2018), Arizona (2008, and 2015), San Francisco (2011, 2012 and 2013), and Seattle (2005, 2013, and 2014). Also since 2002, each team has won at least three division titles, one of only two divisions in the league to do so. \n\nIn 2010, the NFC West became the first division in NFL history to have a champion with a losing record, after the [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|2010 Seattle Seahawks]] won the division title with a record of 7\u20139. They were joined in this distinction in 2014 by the [[2014 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], who won the NFC South with a record of 7\u20138\u20131.\n\nThe division is one of only two in which all of its teams have appeared in a Super Bowl at least once since the 2002 realignment (along with the NFC South):  Arizona ([[2008 NFL season|2008]]), Los Angeles Rams ([[2018 NFL season|2018]]), San Francisco ([[2012 NFL season|2012]], [[2019 NFL season|2019]]), and Seattle ([[2005 NFL season|2005]], [[2013 NFL season|2013]], [[2014 NFL season|2014]]).\n\nSince the end of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 NFL regular season]], the 49ers lead the division with a record of 560\u2013464\u201316 (107\u2013132\u20131 since re-alignment) with five [[Super Bowl]] titles and an overall playoff record of 31\u201321.  The Rams hold a record of 577\u2013569\u201321 (87\u2013152\u20131 since re-alignment) with four Super Bowl appearances and one win to go with a 21\u201326 overall playoff record. The Cardinals hold a 111\u2013128-1 record since joining the NFC West (542\u2013732\u201340 overall) and a loss in [[Super Bowl XLIII]], currently with a 7\u20139 playoff record, 5-4 as a member of the NFC West. The Seahawks hold a record of 137\u2013102-1 since joining the NFC West (325\u2013318-1 overall), with three Super Bowl appearances, winning [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] to go with a playoff record of 16\u201314; they are currently 13\u20139 in the playoffs as a member of the NFC West, having gone 3\u20135 while in the [[AFC West]]. Since re-alignment, the Seahawks have led the division in wins, division titles, and playoff appearances.\n\n==Division lineups==\n\n<small>''' Place cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.</small>'''\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=85%\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:79%; background:#addfff;\"| NFL Western Conference <br>Coastal Division\n! colspan=\"32\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:150%; background:#DEB887;\"| NFC West Division{{ref label|1970|B|B}}\n|-\n!colspan=33|''1900s''||colspan=2|''2000s\n|-\n!

It currently has four members: the [[Arizona Cardinals]], the [[Los Angeles Rams]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]], and the [[Seattle Seahawks]].\n\nThe division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Coastal Division, keeping with the theme of having all of the league's divisions starting with the letter \"C.\" The division was so named because its teams were fairly close to the coasts of the United States, although they were on opposite coasts, making for long travel between division rivals. The NFL Coastal Division had four members: [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Baltimore Colts]], Los Angeles Rams, and San Francisco 49ers. Los Angeles and San Francisco occupied the West Coast, while Baltimore maintained its dominance over the lesser teams that remained in the division. Atlanta was placed in the division despite being farther east than three Eastern Conference teams (Cowboys, Cardinals, and Saints). \n\nAfter the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in 1970, the division was renamed the NFC West. The Baltimore Colts moved to the [[AFC East]] and were replaced by the [[New Orleans Saints]], who came from the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference. In 1976, the newly formed [[Seattle Seahawks]] spent one season in this division before moving to the [[AFC West]]. Except for that one year, the division remained the same until 1995 with the addition of the new [[Carolina Panthers]] team.  The Rams moved to St. Louis before that same season, making the division geographically inaccurate.  Ten of the fifteen NFC teams were based west of Atlanta, and twelve of them were based west of Charlotte.\n\nThe 2002 re-alignment changed the entire look of the NFC West. The Falcons, Panthers, and Saints moved into the [[NFC South]]; while the Cardinals moved in from the NFC East and the Seahawks returned from the AFC West. The Rams remained in the West, preserving the historical rivalry with the 49ers that has existed since [[1950 NFL season|1950]], and thus had been the only team in the division that was located east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] until 2015; despite this, the re-alignment made the NFC West have all of its teams based west of the [[Mississippi River]]. With the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, the entire NFC West is now located west of the Rockies for the first time in its history; all teams except for the Cardinals are based in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] (since most of [[Arizona]] does not observe [[Daylight Savings Time]], the clocks are the same as Pacific Daylight Time from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday of November). \n\nThe NFC West became the second division since the 2002 realignment (The NFC South was the first) to have each of its teams make a conference championship game appearance as well as a Super Bowl appearance: Los Angeles (2018), Arizona (2008, and 2015), San Francisco (2011, 2012 and 2013), and Seattle (2005, 2013, and 2014). Also since 2002, each team has won at least three division titles, one of only two divisions in the league to do so. \n\nIn 2010, the NFC West became the first division in NFL history to have a champion with a losing record, after the [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|2010 Seattle Seahawks]] won the division title with a record of 7\u20139. They were joined in this distinction in 2014 by the [[2014 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], who won the NFC South with a record of 7\u20138\u20131.\n\nThe division is one of only two in which all of its teams have appeared in a Super Bowl at least once since the 2002 realignment (along with the NFC South):  Arizona ([[2008 NFL season|2008]]), Los Angeles Rams ([[2018 NFL season|2018]]), San Francisco ([[2012 NFL season|2012]], [[2019 NFL season|2019]]), and Seattle ([[2005 NFL season|2005]], [[2013 NFL season|2013]], [[2014 NFL season|2014]]).\n\nSince the end of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 NFL regular season]], the 49ers lead the division with a record of 560\u2013464\u201316 (107\u2013132\u20131 since re-alignment) with five [[Super Bowl]] titles and an overall playoff record of 31\u201321.  The Rams hold a record of 577\u2013569\u201321 (87\u2013152\u20131 since re-alignment) with four Super Bowl appearances and one win to go with a 21\u201326 overall playoff record. The Cardinals hold a 111\u2013128-1 record since joining the NFC West (542\u2013732\u201340 overall) and a loss in [[Super Bowl XLIII]], currently with a 7\u20139 playoff record, 5-4 as a member of the NFC West. The Seahawks hold a record of 137\u2013102-1 since joining the NFC West (325\u2013318-1 overall), with three Super Bowl appearances, winning [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] to go with a playoff record of 16\u201314; they are currently 13\u20139 in the playoffs as a member of the NFC West, having gone 3\u20135 while in the [[AFC West]]. Since re-alignment, the Seahawks have led the division in wins, division titles, and playoff appearances.\n\n==Division lineups==\n\n<small>''' Place cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.</small>'''\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=85%\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:79%; background:#addfff;\"| NFL Western Conference <br>Coastal Division\n! colspan=\"32\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:150%; background:#DEB887;\"| NFC West Division{{ref label|1970|B|B}}\n|-\n!colspan=33|''1900s''||colspan=2|''2000s\n|-\n!
