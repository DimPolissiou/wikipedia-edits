Marudhu ([[Shaam (actor)|Shaam]]), an orphaned ship mechanic and sailor, also lives in Rameswaram and decides to give up his sailing life and settle down there. He develops a liking for Nancy ([[Kutty Radhika]]), who sells fruits and other items to sailors on ships that have arrived at the port, but she still holds a candle for the captain of a ship that docked there three years ago. Though Nancy had proposed to him three years ago, he declined stating that 17 was a very young age to marry. To everyone's surprise, the captain is revealed to be Mukundan. He had promised her that he would return in a year, but three years later, Nancy has still not given up hope. Marudhu helps Nancy search for Mukundan, but when he reveals that he loves Nancy, she distances herself from him. They reconcile and become friends. All hope is lost to find Mukundan as they see the captain junior, now as the first officer of another ship. The captain junior reveals that the captain's ship was destroyed in a blast. Soon, Marudhu's ship is scheduled to leave to Africa on Christmas night. Marudhu can decide to join or leave by then. All of them pressurize Nancy to leave her ideas about Mukundan and marry Marudhu. After a very long thought, she agrees by the night of Christmas Eve, and arrangements are made for the wedding next day, but Mukundan returns, surprises Nancy and Marudhu, and finds him kissing her hand in the crowd. He decides that he is the best for her. She is in a dilemma whether to choose Mukundan or Marudhu, and finally selects the former, leaving mixed feelings of joy and sorrow. Marudhu leaves India in his ship, seeking more journeys and promising never to return to his home of Tamil Nadu.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shaam (actor)|Shaam]] as Marudhu \n* [[Arun Kumar (actor)|Arun Kumar]] as Mukundan (credited as Arun; extended cameo)\n* [[Kutty Radhika]] as Nancy Mukundan (credited as Radhika; voice dubbed by [[Deepa Venkat]])\n* [[Senthil]] as Senthil Aandavan\n* [[Seema Biswas]] as Mercy, Nancy's sister-in-law (Voice dubbed by [[Anuradha Sriram]])\n* [[Pasupathy]] as Priest Fernandez\n* [[Chinni Jayanth]] as Vijay, Marudhu's guide\n* [[Karunas]] as Nandu, Marudhu's friend\n* [[Crane Manohar]] as Magician \n* [[Suruli Manohar]]\n* Kumaravel<ref name = \"Opening Credits\">''Iyarkai'' (DVD): opening credits from 1.44 to 2.58</ref>\n* Abhinayashree<ref name = \"Opening Credits\" />\n* [[Ramji (actor)|Ramji]] as Raja\n* [[T.

Its plot follows a sullen, overweight nurse who is seduced by a con man, with whom she embarks on a murder spree of elderly women. The film was inspired by the true story of [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck]], the notorious \"lonely hearts killers\" of the 1940s.\n\nFilmed primarily in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], production of ''The Honeymoon Killers'' began with [[Martin Scorsese]] as its appointed director. However, after Scorsese was fired early into the shoot, Kastle, who had helped develop the film, took over directing. The film's score comprises the first movement of the 6th Symphony and a section of the 5th Symphony of [[Gustav Mahler]]. Released in early 1970, the film was met with critical praise for its performances, as well as remark of its [[Realism (arts)|realism]].\n\n''The Honeymoon Killers'' went on to achieve cult status as well as critical recognition, and was named by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] as his \"favorite American film.\" A digital restoration of the film was released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2003, and again in 2015 with a new digital transfer.\n\n==Plot==\nMartha Beck is a sullen, overweight nursing administrator living in [[Mobile, Alabama]], with her elderly mother. Martha's friend Bunny surreptitiously submits Martha's name to a \"lonely hearts\" club, which results in a letter from Raymond Fernandez of [[New York City]]. Overcoming her initial reluctance, Martha corresponds with Ray and becomes attached to him. He visits Martha in Alabama and seduces her. Thereafter, having secured a loan from her, Ray sends Martha a [[Dear Jane letter]], and Martha enlists Bunny's aid to call him with the (false) news that she has attempted suicide.\n\nRay allows Martha to visit him in New York, where he reveals he is a [[confidence trick|con man]] who makes his living by seducing and then swindling lonely women. Martha is unswayed by this revelation. At Ray's directive, and so she can live with him, Martha admits her mother in a nursing home. Martha's embittered mother disowns her for abandoning her. Martha insists on accompanying Ray at his \"work.\" Woman after woman accepts the attentions of this suitor who goes courting while always within sight of his \"sister\". Ray promises Martha he will never sleep with any of the other women, but complicates his promise by marrying pregnant Myrtle Young. After Young aggressively attempts to bed the bridegroom, Martha gives her a dose of pills, and the two put the drugged woman on a bus. Her death thereafter escapes immediate suspicion.\n\n[[File:Mary Jane Higby in The Honeymoon Killers.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Janet Fay (Mary Jay Higby) just before her murder]]\nThe swindlers move on to their next target, and after catching Ray in a compromising position with the woman, Martha attempts to drown herself. To placate her, Ray rents a house in [[Valley Stream]], a suburb of New York City. He becomes engaged to the elderly Janet Fay of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and takes her to the house he shares with Martha. Janet gives Ray a check for $10,000, but then becomes suspicious of the two. When Janet tries to contact her family, Martha and Ray bludgeon her with a clawhammer before strangling her to death. They bury her body beneath their cellar floor in her trunk, tossing into the grave's dirt the two framed depictions of Jesus that, Martha notes sarcastically, she'd told them she took everywhere she went.\n\nNext, they spend several weeks living in [[Michigan]] with the widowed Delphine Downing and her young daughter. Delphine, younger and prettier than most of Ray's conquests, confides in Martha, hoping that she will help her persuade Ray to marry her as soon as possible because she is pregnant with Ray's child. Martha is in the midst of drugging Delphine when the woman's daughter enters the room with Ray. He shoots Delphine in the head, and Martha drowns the daughter in the cellar. Ray tells Martha that he must proceed with his plan to move on to one more woman, this one in [[New Orleans]], and then he will marry Martha; he reaffirms his promise never to betray her with one of his marks. Realizing that Ray will never stop lying to her, Martha calls the police and waits calmly for them to arrive.\n\nThe [[epilogue]] takes place four months later, with Martha and Ray in jail. As she leaves the cellblock for the first day of their trial, Martha receives a letter from Ray in which he tells her that, despite everything, she is the only woman he ever loved. Titles on the screen then conclude the story, saying that Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez were executed at [[Sing Sing]] on March 8, 1951.{{efn|Although the real-life Beck and Fernandez were arrested originally in Michigan and charged with the murders of the Downings, those prosecutions were suspended and they were extradited to New York to be tried for the murder of Janet Fay, because New York, unlike Michigan, had the death penalty.  It was for the murder of Fay that they were convicted and executed.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n*[[Shirley Stoler]] as [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck|Martha Beck]]\n*[[Tony Lo Bianco]] as [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck|Raymond Fernandez]]\n*[[Doris Roberts]] as Bunny\n*[[Marilyn Chris]] as Myrtle Young\n*[[Barbara Cason]] as Evelyn Long\n*Dortha Duckworth as Mrs. Beck\n*[[Mary Jane Higby]] as Janet Fay\n*Kip McArdle as Delphine (actually, Deliphene) Price Downing\n*Mary Breen as Rainelle Downing\n*Ann Harris as Doris\n*[[Elsa Raven]] as Matron\n*Mary Engel as Lucy\n*Guy Sorel as Mr. Dranoff\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe film was the first for producer [[Warren Steibel]] (known as the producer of television's ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]''), writer/director [[Leonard Kastle]] (known as a composer), and cinematographer [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]]. A wealthy friend of Steibel, [[Leon Levy]], suggested to Steibel that he make a film, and gave Steibel $150,000, the amount that Steibel suggested it would cost.<ref name=\"nytbehind\"/> After deciding the film would be about [[Raymond Fernandez (serial killer)|\"The Lonely Hearts Killers\"]], Steibel asked Kastle, his roommate, to do some research on the subject; financial limitations led Steibel to ask his friend to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"nytbehind\"/>\n\nCommenting on the aims of the film, Steibel said: \"We wanted to do an honest movie about murders.

Although the actual events unfolded in the late 1940s, the film is set at the time of its making, the late 1960s. The film presents the killings as commencing with Beck's entrance on the scene and as a consequence of her jealousy. In contrast, it is believed that Fernandez had murdered at least one of the victims of his swindling, Jane Wilson Thompson, before meeting Beck, in order to pose as Thompson's widower and claim title to her property, including the apartment in New York where Beck joined him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Study Love Notes for Clue to Identity of Killer's \u2018Irene\u2019|work=[[Milwaukee Journal]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=March 5, 1949|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fernandez, Woman Face Michigan Murder Trial|work=Kingston Daily Freeman|location=Kingston, New York|date= March 2, 1949|pages=1, 17}}</ref> There is no acknowledgment that Beck was divorced with two children,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killer Asks for Children's Photos|work=Record-Eagle|location=Traverse City, Michigan|date=September 16, 1949|p=11}}</ref> whom she abandoned on Fernandez's orders (her abandonment of her mother is substituted); nor is there mention of Fernandez's legal wife and four children in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Says He Was Charming When He Married Her|work=[[The Sun (Lowell)|The Lowell Sun]]|location=Lowell, Massachusetts|date= March 2, 1949|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts Beck's surrender of herself and Fernandez, but that implied demonstration of remorse is contrary to the historical record: neighbors noticed the Downings' disappearance, and Beck and Fernandez were apprehended at the Downing house after returning from an evening at the movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lonely Heart\u2019 Killings Bared: Widow and Child Buried in Concrete|work=News-Palladium|location=Benton Harbor, Michigan|date=March 1, 1949|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Justice for Mr. and Mrs. Bluebeard|work=Sunday Press|location=Binghamton, New York|date=February 18, 1951|p=8-C}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Shirley Stoler in The Honeymoon Killers.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Stoler as Martha Beck]]\n[[Shirley Stoler]] and [[Tony Lo Bianco]], both stage actors in New York, were cast in the leading roles.<ref name=show/> Stoler, also a singer, was referred by her friend, [[Marilyn Chris]], who had been cast in the role of Myrtle: \"It was by accident that I got the role,\" Stoler stated. \"I had just returned from Europe where I had been singing in cafes and had no job prospect.\"<ref name=bg>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39262067/the_boston_globe/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=February 17, 1970|p=18|title=Fat actresses don't have to play funny roles|last=Adams|first=Marjory|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Stoler and Chris had worked together performing in stage productions at [[The Living Theatre]] in Manhattan,<ref name=bg/> while Lo Bianco had performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=show/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography of ''The Honeymoon Killers'' began in August 1969, and concluded in October.<ref name=bg/> During production, it had the [[working title]] ''Dear Martha''.<ref name=wood/> The majority of the film was shot in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]<ref name=show>{{cite news|title=That's show business|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39262092/the_philadelphia_inquirer/|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|last=Wilson|first=Barbara L.|date=February 13, 1970|p=11|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> and [[Albany, New York]].

by [[Leonard Kastle]], and starring [[Shirley Stoler]] and [[Tony Lo Bianco]]. Its plot follows a sullen, overweight nurse who is seduced by a con man, with whom she embarks on a murder spree of elderly women. The film was inspired by the true story of [[Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck]], the notorious \"lonely hearts killers\" of the 1940s.\n\nFilmed primarily in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], production of ''The Honeymoon Killers'' began with [[Martin Scorsese]] as its appointed director. However, after Scorsese was fired early into the shoot, Kastle, who had helped develop the film, took over directing. The film's score comprises the first movement of the 6th Symphony and a section of the 5th Symphony of [[Gustav Mahler]]. Released in early 1970, the film was met with critical praise for its performances, as well as remark of its [[Realism (arts)|realism]].\n\n''The Honeymoon Killers'' went on to achieve cult status as well as critical recognition, and was named by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] as his \"favorite American film.\" A digital restoration of the film was released on DVD by [[The Criterion Collection]] in 2003, and again in 2015 with a new digital transfer.\n\n==Plot==\nMartha Beck is a sullen, overweight nursing administrator living in [[Mobile, Alabama]], with her elderly mother. Martha's friend Bunny surreptitiously submits Martha's name to a \"lonely hearts\" club, which results in a letter from Raymond Fernandez of [[New York City]]. Overcoming her initial reluctance, Martha corresponds with Ray and becomes attached to him. He visits Martha in Alabama and seduces her. Thereafter, having secured a loan from her, Ray sends Martha a [[Dear Jane letter]], and Martha enlists Bunny's aid to call him with the (false) news that she has attempted suicide.\n\nRay allows Martha to visit him in New York, where he reveals he is a [[confidence trick|con man]] who makes his living by seducing and then swindling lonely women. Martha is unswayed by this revelation. At Ray's directive, and so she can live with him, Martha admits her mother in a nursing home. Martha's embittered mother disowns her for abandoning her. Martha insists on accompanying Ray at his \"work.\" Woman after woman accepts the attentions of this suitor who goes courting while always within sight of his \"sister\". Ray promises Martha he will never sleep with any of the other women, but complicates his promise by marrying pregnant Myrtle Young. After Young aggressively attempts to bed the bridegroom, Martha gives her a dose of pills, and the two put the drugged woman on a bus. Her death thereafter escapes immediate suspicion.\n\n[[File:Mary Jane Higby in The Honeymoon Killers.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Janet Fay (Mary Jay Higby) just before her murder]]\nThe swindlers move on to their next target, and after catching Ray in a compromising position with the woman, Martha attempts to drown herself. To placate her, Ray rents a house in [[Valley Stream]], a suburb of New York City. He becomes engaged to the elderly Janet Fay of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and takes her to the house he shares with Martha. Janet gives Ray a check for $10,000, but then becomes suspicious of the two. When Janet tries to contact her family, Martha and Ray bludgeon her with a clawhammer before strangling her to death. They bury her body beneath their cellar floor in her trunk, tossing into the grave's dirt the two framed depictions of Jesus that, Martha notes sarcastically, she'd told them she took everywhere she went.\n\nNext, they spend several weeks living in [[Michigan]] with the widowed Delphine Downing and her young daughter. Delphine, younger and prettier than most of Ray's conquests, confides in Martha, hoping that she will help her persuade Ray to marry her as soon as possible because she is pregnant with Ray's child. Martha is in the midst of drugging Delphine when the woman's daughter enters the room with Ray. He shoots Delphine in the head, and Martha drowns the daughter in the cellar. Ray tells Martha that he must proceed with his plan to move on to one more woman, this one in [[New Orleans]], and then he will marry Martha; he reaffirms his promise never to betray her with one of his marks. Realizing that Ray will never stop lying to her, Martha calls the police and waits calmly for them to arrive.\n\nThe [[epilogue]] takes place four months later, with Martha and Ray in jail. As she leaves the cellblock for the first day of their trial, Martha receives a letter from Ray in which he tells her that, despite everything, she is the only woman he ever loved. Titles on the screen then conclude the story, saying that Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez were executed at [[Sing Sing]] on March 8, 1951.{{efn|Although the real-life Beck and Fernandez were arrested originally in Michigan and charged with the murders of the Downings, those prosecutions were suspended and they were extradited to New York to be tried for the murder of Janet Fay, because New York, unlike Michigan, had the death penalty.

A wealthy friend of Steibel, [[Leon Levy]], suggested to Steibel that he make a film, and gave Steibel $150,000, the amount that Steibel suggested it would cost.<ref name=\"nytbehind\"/> After deciding the film would be about [[Raymond Fernandez|\"The Lonely Hearts Killers\"]], Steibel asked Kastle, his roommate, to do some research on the subject; financial limitations led Steibel to ask his friend to write the screenplay.<ref name=\"nytbehind\"/>\n\nCommenting on the aims of the film, Steibel said: \"We wanted to do an honest movie about murders.

Although the actual events unfolded in the late 1940s, the film is set at the time of its making, the late 1960s. The film presents the killings as commencing with Beck's entrance on the scene and as a consequence of her jealousy. In contrast, it is believed that Fernandez had murdered at least one of the victims of his swindling, Jane Wilson Thompson, before meeting Beck, in order to pose as Thompson's widower and claim title to her property, including the apartment in New York where Beck joined him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Study Love Notes for Clue to Identity of Killer's \u2018Irene\u2019|work=[[Milwaukee Journal]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=March 5, 1949|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fernandez, Woman Face Michigan Murder Trial|work=Kingston Daily Freeman|location=Kingston, New York|date= March 2, 1949|pages=1, 17}}</ref> There is no acknowledgment that Beck was divorced with two children,<ref>{{cite news|title=Killer Asks for Children's Photos|work=Record-Eagle|location=Traverse City, Michigan|date=September 16, 1949|p=11}}</ref> whom she abandoned on Fernandez's orders (her abandonment of her mother is substituted); nor is there mention of Fernandez's legal wife and four children in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Says He Was Charming When He Married Her|work=[[The Sun (Lowell)|The Lowell Sun]]|location=Lowell, Massachusetts|date= March 2, 1949|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe film depicts Beck's surrender of herself and Fernandez, but that implied demonstration of remorse is contrary to the historical record: neighbors noticed the Downings' disappearance, and Beck and Fernandez were apprehended at the Downing house after returning from an evening at the movies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lonely Heart\u2019 Killings Bared: Widow and Child Buried in Concrete|work=News-Palladium|location=Benton Harbor, Michigan|date=March 1, 1949|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Justice for Mr. and Mrs. Bluebeard|work=Sunday Press|location=Binghamton, New York|date=February 18, 1951|p=8-C}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Shirley Stoler in The Honeymoon Killers.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Stoler as Martha Beck]]\n[[Shirley Stoler]] and [[Tony Lo Bianco]], both stage actors in New York, were cast in the leading roles.<ref name=show/> Stoler, also a singer, was referred by her friend, [[Marilyn Chris]], who had been cast in the role of Myrtle: \"It was by accident that I got the role,\" Stoler stated. \"I had just returned from Europe where I had been singing in cafes and had no job prospect.\"<ref name=bg>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39262067/the_boston_globe/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=February 17, 1970|p=18|title=Fat actresses don't have to play funny roles|last=Adams|first=Marjory|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Stoler and Chris had worked together performing in stage productions at [[The Living Theatre]] in Manhattan,<ref name=bg/> while Lo Bianco had performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=show/>\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography of ''The Honeymoon Killers'' began in August 1969, and concluded in October.<ref name=bg/> During production, it had the [[working title]] ''Dear Martha''.<ref name=wood/> The majority of the film was shot in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]<ref name=show>{{cite news|title=That's show business|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/39262092/the_philadelphia_inquirer/|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|last=Wilson|first=Barbara L.|date=February 13, 1970|p=11|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> and [[Albany, New York]].

Be its form or content, uniqueness in those poems has created perhaps the most valuable impact on modern Bengali poetry over the years. In the decades to follow those two brief collections of poems by Basu have resulted in a turning point in contemporary Bengali poetry and it has been recognized as a benchmark by the younger generation of poets to follow. But Utpal Kumar Basu kept on experimenting with his form and language. According to him -\"The evolution of form has to be rapid and continuous , whereas the concept evolves slowly, maybe once in a century.(\u09a7\u09c2\u09b8\u09b0 \u0986\u09a4\u09be\u0997\u09be\u099b )\"\n\nUtpal Kumar Basu eventually met American poet Allen [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]] in Kolkata in the early sixties and both shared a great friendship. Basu connected himself with [[Hungry generation]] literary movement<ref>[[Hungry generation]]</ref> in 60s and was compelled to resign from his job as a lecturer in a Kolkata college . He traveled far and wide, over the seas and years in Europe doing some part-time jobs to survive. In England he associated himself with various socialist organizations. His poetry had to pause temporarily but only to find a new path to flow in the form of his famous \"travel poems\" and published a number of small, unassuming collections of poems with the lesser known Little Magazine publishing houses. At this time, he was also writing regularly on a variety of subjects for popular Bengali dailies including Aajkaal and AnandaBazar Patrika.\nHe also translated works of such eminent writers as Ayappa Pannikar, Kamala Das and edited a translation of a collection of Mizo Poems and Songs for Sahitya Akademi. Translations of his poems have been published regularly in the London Magazine. Utpal Kumar Basu died on 3 October 2015 in Kolkata after a prolonged illness. He is survived by his wife Santana and son Firoze and continues to be an inspiration for little magazine publishers and young poets of Bengal.\nUtpalkumar Basu has been awarded the Ananda Puraskar by the ABP group of publications in 2006 and the Rabindra Puraskar by the Paschim Banga Bangla Academy 2011 both for his collection of poems Sukh Dukhser Sathi. In 2014 he received the Sahitya Academy Award for his collection of poems entitled Piya Mana Bhabe. He was awarded the Sahitya Academy Translation prize 2018 for his translation into Bengali of Srimati Kamala Das's collection of poems entitled Only The Soul Knows How To Sing.(posthumous)\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kaurab.tripod.com/english/bengali_poetry/utpal.html |title=KAURAB Online :: Utpal Kumar Basu |publisher=Kaurab.tripod.com |date=

Being a [[geologist]] by education he is known for his witty but meticulous approach towards the nature, objects and life, which may seem to be similar to that of a scientist.<ref>http://www.webpressclub.org/2015/10/ace-poet-utpalkumar-died-in-kolkata.html</ref>\nSecond and third collection of poems by Utpal Kumar Basu, namely Puri Series (1964) and Abar Puri Series (1978) presented an astonishing new diction to Bengali literature, which are popularly referred to as Famous Travel Poetry Of Utpal. Be its form or content, uniqueness in those poems has created perhaps the most valuable impact on modern Bengali poetry over the years. In the decades to follow those two brief collections of poems by Basu have resulted in a turning point in contemporary Bengali poetry and it has been recognized as a benchmark by the younger generation of poets to follow. But Utpal Kumar Basu kept on experimenting with his form and language. According to him -\"The evolution of form has to be rapid and continuous , whereas the concept evolves slowly, maybe once in a century.(\u09a7\u09c2\u09b8\u09b0 \u0986\u09a4\u09be\u0997\u09be\u099b )\"\n\nUtpal Kumar Basu eventually met American poet Allen [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]] in Kolkata in the early sixties and both shared a great friendship. Basu connected himself with [[Hungry generation]] literary movement<ref>[[Hungry generation]]</ref> in 60s and was compelled to resign from his job as a lecturer in a Kolkata college . He traveled far and wide, over the seas and years in Europe doing some part-time jobs to survive. In England he associated himself with various socialist organizations. His poetry had to pause temporarily but only to find a new path to flow in the form of his famous \"travel poems\" and published a number of small, unassuming collections of poems with the lesser known Little Magazine publishing houses. At this time, he was also writing regularly on a variety of subjects for popular Bengali dailies including Aajkaal and AnandaBazar Patrika.\nHe also translated works of such eminent writers as Ayappa Pannikar, Kamala Das and edited a translation of a collection of Mizo Poems and Songs for Sahitya Akademi. Translations of his poems have been published regularly in the London Magazine. Utpal Kumar Basu died on 3 October 2015 in Kolkata after a prolonged illness. He is survived by his wife Santana and son Firoze and continues to be an inspiration for little magazine publishers and young poets of Bengal.\nUtpalkumar Basu has been awarded the Ananda Puraskar by the ABP group of publications in 2006 and the Rabindra Puraskar by the Paschim Banga Bangla Academy 2011 both for his collection of poems Sukh Dukhser Sathi. In 2014 he received the Sahitya Academy Award for his collection of poems entitled Piya Mana Bhabe. He was awarded the Sahitya Academy Translation prize 2018 for his translation into Bengali of Srimati Kamala Das's collection of poems entitled Only The Soul Knows How To Sing.(posthumous)\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kaurab.tripod.com/english/bengali_poetry/utpal.html |title=KAURAB Online :: Utpal Kumar Basu |publisher=Kaurab.tripod.com |date=

Women pilots were also called \"aviatrices\" (singular: \"aviatrix\"). Women have been flying powered aircraft since 1908; prior to 1970, however, most were restricted to working privately or in support roles in the [[aviation]] industry.{{sfn|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|2013}} Aviation also allowed women to \"travel alone on unprecedented journeys.\"{{sfn|Dall'Acqua|1986|p=1}} Women who have been successful in various aviation fields have served as [[Mentorship|mentors]] to younger women, helping them along in their careers.{{sfn|Olsen|2016}}\n\nWithin the first two decades of powered flight, women on every continent except Antarctica had begun to fly, perform in aerial shows, parachute, and even transport passengers. During World War II, women from every continent helped with war efforts and though mostly restricted from military flight many of the female pilots flew in auxiliary services.

By 1944 around 6,000 women had been trained as [[Link Trainer]] operators and were teaching male pilots how to read instruments. [[WAVES]] like [[Patricia W.

However, few were pioneers, and their influence and impact were huge, paving the way for more women to be involved in the different aspects of the aviation industry.\n\n'''Harriet Quimby \u2013 1875 to 1912'''\n\nA celebrated pioneer in the United States, Quimby was adventurous and encouraged more women to join the aviation industry. Through her weekly articles in various magazines, she challenged women, and through her visions of airlines to ferry people and scheduled air routes, she made a huge contribution towards the growth and the development of the aviation industry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harriet Quimby : flying fair lady|last=Kerr, Leslie|isbn=978-0-7643-5067-2|location=Atglen, PA|oclc=927401943|year = 2016}}</ref> She warned those who flew aircraft on the dangers of being overconfident and emphasized on the importance of observing safety while piloting .

Quimby had strong belief in the aviation industry of the United States and encouraged more women to take on the air .\n\n'''Nancy Harkness Love - 1914 to 1976'''\n\nBorn in February 1914, Nancy played an instrumental role in the acceptance of women, both as career and military pilots. At the age of 16 years, with only 15 hours of solo time, Nancy flew a plane from Boston to Poughkeepsie, New York, where the weather changed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Deborah G.|date=2010|title=Nancy Batson Crews: Alabama's First Lady of Flight (review)|journal=Alabama Review|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=298\u2013299|doi=10.1353/ala.2010.0026|issn=2166-9961}}</ref> She did not know how to read the compass, and with the gauge broken, had to land the plane . She safely landed the plane, an event that would mark her 40-year career in the aviation industry.

Under her command, women flew every type of military aircraft. In addition, through her firm belief that women could still co-exist with men and take on non-traditional roles, more doors were opened for more women in the aviation industry .\n\n'''Geraldine (Jerrie) Cobb \u2013 1931 to 2019'''\n\nBorn to a commercial pilot in 1931, Jerrie Cobb was the first woman to qualify to go into space.

[[Vietnam Airlines]], a major carrier in one of fastest-growing aviation markets, has created flight-schedules that allow flexibility to deal with personal demands. [[EasyJet Plc]] provides scholarships for women pilots to help offset the high cost of training and [[EVA Air]] has actively recruited candidates from university programs.{{sfn|Boudreau|Nguyen|2016}}\n\nIn Africa, many of the trained pilots migrate to the [[Middle East]] or Asia where opportunities for career advancement and more sophisticated facilities exist. [[Women Aviators in Africa]] was founded in 2008 in an attempt to mentor and inspire young women to train in the aviation industry, as estimates for women in the field fall considerably below 6%. Though there is a high level of need across Africa for rural aviation, there is insufficient infrastructure to support expansion. Grass-roots efforts have seen success with training for bush pilots in transport, medical assistance and policing. Efforts are on-going to increase the numbers of women because women are less likely to move to other areas if they as able to find sufficient employment and opportunities in their own communities.{{sfn|Grant|2011}} As of 2016, seven of the top ten markets in terms of growth-speed of aviation were in Africa.{{sfn|Boudreau|Nguyen|2016}}\n\n== Sexism ==\nWomen often had to work hard to prove themselves as capable as men in the field.

Women pilots were also called \"aviatrices\" (singular: \"aviatrix\"). Women have been flying powered aircraft since 1908; prior to 1970, however, most were restricted to working privately or in support roles in the [[aviation]] industry.{{sfn|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|2013}} Aviation also allowed women to \"travel alone on unprecedented journeys.\"{{sfn|Dall'Acqua|1986|p=1}} Women who have been successful in various aviation fields have served as [[Mentorship|mentors]] to younger women, helping them along in their careers.{{sfn|Olsen|2016}}\n\nWithin the first two decades of powered flight, women on every continent except Antarctica had begun to fly, perform in aerial shows, parachute, and even transport passengers. During World War II, women from every continent helped with war efforts and though mostly restricted from military flight many of the female pilots flew in auxiliary services. In the 1950s and 1960s, women were primarily restricted to serving in support fields such as flight simulation training, air traffic control, and as flight attendants. Since the 1970s, women have been allowed to participate in military service in most countries.\n\nWomen's participation in the field of aviation has increased over the years. In the United States, in 1930, there were around 200 women pilots but in five years there were more than 700.{{sfn|Gant|2001|pp=11\u201312}} [[Women of Aviation Worldwide Week]] has reported that after 1980, the increase in gender parity for women pilots in the [[United States]] has been stagnant.{{sfn|Goyer|2012}} Women flying commercial airlines in [[India]] make up 11.6% of all pilots.
