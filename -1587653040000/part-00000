KIA has grown rapidly with an increasing number of passengers and aircraft movement. In 2017, KIA handled 5,095,193 passengers with a corresponding volume of 51,097 flights. In the same year, 24,620 metric tonnes of cargo were handled through this facility.\n\nKIA is the secondary hub for [[Malaysia Airlines]] and has been growing rapidly to tackle the demand of the travellers in the East Malaysia region.\n\n== History ==\n\nAn airstrip in Kuching was first constructed at 7th Mile (Bukit Stabar) in 1938, measuring {{convert|700|yd|m}} long by {{convert|300|yd|m}} wide.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Keat Gin |first1=Ooi |title=Rising Sun over Borneo: The Japanese Occupation of Sarawak, 1941\u20131945 |date=18 February 1999 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-349-27300-3 |page=28 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhKwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28 |accessdate=18 June 2016 |quote=On 26 September 1938, Kuching landing ground was situated at 7th Mile (Bukit Stabar)...}}</ref> An airport terminal building was later completed and opened for use on 26 September 1950.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chia |first1=Jonathan |title=History through a retiree's lenses |url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/12/25/history-through-a-retirees-lenses/ |accessdate=18 June 2016 |work=Borneo Post |date=25 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828011722/http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/12/25/history-through-a-retirees-lenses/ |archivedate=28 August 2013 |quote=One of his photos shows a large crowd at the opening and open day of Kuching Airport on Sept 26, 1950.}}</ref> The airport consisted of a small \"L\" shaped single storey passenger terminal, a small cargo facility, and an airport fire station. Air Traffic Control Tower, Meteorological Service and Maintenance building were clustered in one area, a small apron of 4 parking bays and a single runway which was 1,372 metres long and 46 metres wide. Navigational (Directional Finding Equipment) and Radio Aids were installed at the airport.\n<!-- Add the date and facts of the airport emerged as an International Airport here --->\n\nKuching International Airport then became the gateway to Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo (Sabah as it is called today) with the introduction of once weekly Douglas Dakota twin-engined piston aircraft services originating from Singapore. By the end of 1954, scheduled air services into Kuching International Airport grew by leaps and bounds. This was depicted in the 1954 statistics which recorded 1,550 aircraft movements, 13,564 passengers, 95,911 kilogrammes of cargo and 25,984 mails.\nIn 1959, the runway was extended to 1,555 metres in length to make way for Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft operations.\n\nIn 1962, the runway was extended once more to a length of 1,921 meters to facilitate DeHavilland Comet-4 turbojet aircraft operations. The terminal was also enlarged in the same year. A Control Zone was established at Kuching in November as a part of a plan to provide an Air Traffic Control Service commensurate with the growth of air traffic. Malayan Airways Limited operated the Singapore / British Borneo Territories Regional Services with Vickers Viscount and Douglas DC-3 aircraft, daily schedules linked Kuching and Sibu with Singapore on the other side, and Brunei and Borneo on the other.\n\nIn 1971, the Malaysian Government (as Sarawak joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 November 1963) engaged a team of Canadian Consultants to make a Master Plan study of Kuching International Airport.\n\nIn December 1972, the government accepted the Consultant's report. Among the recommendations were:\n* The extension and strengthening of existing runway to enable operations by larger jet-powered aircraft\n* The construction of a new terminal building on the north site of the runway\n\nWork on the strengthening and extension of the runway to {{convert|2454|m}} in length started in 1973 and was completed in 1976, capable of handling Boeing 707 turbofan aircraft.\n\nIn 1980, consistent with the advent of Airbus A300B4 operations, it was imperative that the runway pavement strength be upgraded to meet the requirements of that particular aircraft. Work on this was completed in early 1982.\n\nConstruction of the terminal complex at the north site took a centre stage at the end of 1978 and was completed in July 1983. This modern terminal replaced the previous terminal, and was opened for business on 24 August 1983. The terminal complex covered a built-up area of 81 hectares with a floor space of 13,000 square metres, comprised the three-storey passenger terminal flanked by neatly planned buildings which consisted of the Air Traffic Control Tower and operations block, a larger freight facility, a new airport fire station, Maintenance Building, VIP Building and ancillary services building.\n\nAs of 1999, two foreign airlines (Singapore Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines) from both Singapore and Brunei as well as Malaysia's national carrier and as many as 8 private general aviation companies operated scheduled services into and out of Kuching International Airport. Non-scheduled charter flights were also operated by two foreign airlines. As of 2018, however, four of Malaysia's airlines (Malaysia Airlines, MasWings, Air Asia and Malindo Air) as well as four cargo operators (Asia Cargo Express, MASKargo, Raya Airways and Neptune Air) operate to and from Kuching International Airport. They are joined by three foreign carriers (Royal Brunei Airlines, Scoot and Wings Air). In 2019, Royal Brunei, in a joint venture with Malindo Air, further connected Kuching to BWN using Malindo Air's ATR aircraft. Foreign airlines that have previously provided services to Kuching were Singapore Airlines, Dragonair, Hong Kong Airlines, Jetstar Asia, Merpati Nusantara Airlines, Silk Air, Batavia Air, Kalstar Airlines, Xpress Air and Tiger Airways.  The latter returned to Kuching after merging with Scoot while Xpress Air stopped services following stiff competition from AirAsia and Wings Air on the Kuching-Pontianak route as well as Xpress Air concentrating on domestic routes due to Xpress Air's core business.\n\nAs a result of the increasing number of passengers going into and out of Kuching, a completely new and larger terminal was needed. Construction started in the early 2000s, and progressed at an incredible pace. The new terminal was literally constructed from the inside out, with the old terminal slowly being chipped away and replaced by new sections of the new terminal. The new terminal complex was finally opened on Monday, the 16th of January 2006 by the [[Chief Minister of Sarawak]] [[Abdul Taib Mahmud|Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud]] and the then Malaysian Minister of Transport [[Chan Kong Choy|Dato' Sri Chan Kong Choy]]. The full work on the terminal, however, was only completed in April 2006. The new terminal consists of 12 aerobridge aircraft parking bays (4 bays for widebody aircraft such as Airbus A330/A350/A380-800, Boeing 747/777 and 5 bays for narrow body aircraft, principally Boeing 738/9 and A319/320), 4 remote parking bays (for turboprop aircraft such as Fokker 50, DHC-6-300/400 Twin Otter and ATR 72-500/600), plus 3 new aircraft parking bays located at the general aviation section.\n[[File:MAS747KIA.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysia Airlines Boeing 747 on the runway]]\n[[File:KIA Control Tower.jpg|thumb|Control Tower]]\n[[File:KIA newterminal.jpg|thumb|The Terminal Building]]\n\n== Expansion, renovation and redevelopment ==\nKuching International Airport was given a radical makeover, with the terminal completed in 2006 and the runway and taxiway extension fully completed in 2008.<ref name=\"asia-airports.com\">[http://asia-airports.com/malaysia/kch/index.php Global Asia Airports: Kuching International Airport, Malaysia]</ref> The renovations borrowed many design features from Kuala Lumpur's then-new airport (KL International Airport opened in 1998, replacing the overcrowded Subang-Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport), so the two have a similar look.<ref name=\"asia-airports.com\" />\n\nThe renovation increased terminal building floor space to {{convert|46000|m2}} and was completed 15 months ahead of schedule. The fully renovated terminal building was officially opened by the then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] on Monday, 17 April 2006. The project was handled by Global Upline Sdn. Bhd. and it cost some MYR620,000,000 (US$186,000,000). With this, the airport is capable of handling widebody aircraft such as Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A380-800 (albeit with airside restrictions on the runway and taxiway network).\n\nThe completed works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, extension of the runway length from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel taxiway to a full parallel taxiway with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of taxiway fillets and shoulders to 30 metres. The air-side apron works included the construction of a cargo apron, high-intensity lightings and markings. Visual and non-visual aids will be upgraded and/or relocated consistent with the upgrading plan to serve the extended runway. With nine gates, the airport can handle six narrow body aircraft (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320), three widebody aircraft and four turboprop aircraft. Of note, gate number 9 was specifically constructed for Airbus A380-800 operations.<ref>[http://www.globalupline.com/project4.html Global Upline KIA Expansion]</ref><ref>[http://www.theborneopost.com/?p=53173 KIA runway extension marks new era for city]</ref>\n\n== Present and future ==\nThe former Chief Minister of Sarawak, Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud, wishes to attract more foreign airlines to KIA so as to develop the Sarawak Tourism Industry. Singapore's budget airline, [[Tiger Airways]], had been given the green light to serve Kuching International Airport (the airline has since discontinued service to Kuching after only a few years, as did its closest competitor, Jetstar Asia).\n\nAs of 2006, [[Malaysia Airlines]] in Kuching International Airport has so far achieved a zero accident rate.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F15%2Fnation%2F20070115152515&sec=nation |title=MAS achieved zero accident rate in KIA |access-date=2011-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608140821/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F15%2Fnation%2F20070115152515&sec=nation |archive-date=2011-06-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Sarawak Government is working closely with Malaysia Airlines (MAS) and AirAsia to rationalise long-haul flights. Sarawak hopes to use Brunei and Singapore as entry points to enhance the two prevailing gateways \u2013 Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA).\n\nThe Sarawak Government has expressed interest to buy into [[MASwings]] and turn it into a sub-ASEAN air carrier, with Kuching as its hub. New routes could include direct flights to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Jakarta, Denpasar, Bangkok and destinations in Australia. Flight frequency to Singapore would also be increased.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2015/08/10/Bid-to-up-stake-in-MASwings-Sabah-and-Sarawak-in-talks-with-Khazanah/ |title=Bid to up stake in MASwings |work=The Star |accessdate=2015-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe head office of [[Hornbill Skyways]] is in North Pan Hangar at Kuching International Airport.<ref>\"[http://www.hornbillskyways.com/contact.php LOCATION].\" [[Hornbill Skyways]].

Air Traffic Control Tower, Meteorological Service and Maintenance building were clustered in one area, a small apron of 4 parking bays and a single runway which was 1,372 metres long and 46 metres wide. Navigational (Directional Finding Equipment) and Radio Aids were installed at the airport.\n<!-- Add the date and facts of the airport emerged as an International Airport here --->\n\nKuching International Airport then became the gateway to Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo (Sabah as it is called today) with the introduction of once weekly Douglas Dakota twin-engined piston aircraft services originating from Singapore. By the end of 1954, scheduled air services into Kuching International Airport grew by leaps and bounds. This was depicted in the 1954 statistics which recorded 1,550 aircraft movements, 13,564 passengers, 95,911 kilogrammes of cargo and 25,984 mails.\nIn 1959, the runway was extended to 1,555 metres in length to make way for Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft operations.\n\nIn 1962, the runway was extended once more to a length of 1,921 meters to facilitate DeHavilland Comet-4 turbojet aircraft operations. The terminal was also enlarged in the same year. A Control Zone was established at Kuching in November as a part of a plan to provide an Air Traffic Control Service commensurate with the growth of air traffic. Malayan Airways Limited operated the Singapore / British Borneo Territories Regional Services with Vickers Viscount and Douglas DC-3 aircraft, daily schedules linked Kuching and Sibu with Singapore on the other side, and Brunei and Borneo on the other.\n\nIn 1971, the Malaysian Government (as Sarawak joined the Federation of Malaysia on 16 November 1963) engaged a team of Canadian Consultants to make a Master Plan study of Kuching International Airport.\n\nIn December 1972, the government accepted the Consultant's report. Among the recommendations were:\n* The extension and strengthening of existing runway to enable operations by larger jet-powered aircraft\n* The construction of a new terminal building on the north site of the runway\n\nWork on the strengthening and extension of the runway to {{convert|2454|m}} in length started in 1973 and was completed in 1976, capable of handling Boeing 707 turbofan aircraft.\n\nIn 1980, consistent with the advent of Airbus A300B4 operations, it was imperative that the runway pavement strength be upgraded to meet the requirements of that particular aircraft. Work on this was completed in early 1982.\n\nConstruction of the terminal complex at the north site took a centre stage at the end of 1978 and was completed in July 1983. This modern terminal replaced the previous terminal, and was opened for business on 24 August 1983. The terminal complex covered a built-up area of 81 hectares with a floor space of 13,000 square metres, comprised the three-storey passenger terminal flanked by neatly planned buildings which consisted of the Air Traffic Control Tower and operations block, a larger freight facility, a new airport fire station, Maintenance Building, VIP Building and ancillary services building.\n\nAs of 1999, two foreign airlines (Singapore Airlines and Royal Brunei Airlines) from both Singapore and Brunei as well as Malaysia's national carrier and as many as 8 private general aviation companies operated scheduled services into and out of Kuching International Airport. Non-scheduled charter flights were also operated by two foreign airlines. As of 2018, however, four of Malaysia's airlines (Malaysia Airlines, MasWings, Air Asia and Malindo Air) as well as four cargo operators (Asia Cargo Express, MASKargo, Raya Airways and Neptune Air) operate to and from Kuching International Airport. They are joined by three foreign carriers (Royal Brunei Airlines, Scoot and Wings Air). In 2019, Royal Brunei, in a joint venture with Malindo Air, further connected Kuching to BWN using Malindo Air's ATR aircraft. Foreign airlines that have previously provided services to Kuching were Singapore Airlines, Dragonair, Hong Kong Airlines, Jetstar Asia, Merpati Nusantara Airlines, Silk Air, Batavia Air, Kalstar Airlines, Xpress Air and Tiger Airways.  The latter returned to Kuching after merging with Scoot while Xpress Air stopped services following stiff competition from AirAsia and Wings Air on the Kuching-Pontianak route as well as Xpress Air concentrating on domestic routes due to Xpress Air's core business.\n\nAs a result of the increasing number of passengers going into and out of Kuching, a completely new and larger terminal was needed. Construction started in the early 2000s, and progressed at an incredible pace. The new terminal was literally constructed from the inside out, with the old terminal slowly being chipped away and replaced by new sections of the new terminal. The new terminal complex was finally opened on Monday, the 16th of January 2006 by the [[Chief Minister of Sarawak]] [[Abdul Taib Mahmud|Pehin Sri Haji Abdul Taib Mahmud]] and the then Malaysian Minister of Transport [[Chan Kong Choy|Dato' Sri Chan Kong Choy]]. The full work on the terminal, however, was only completed in April 2006. The new terminal consists of 12 aerobridge aircraft parking bays (4 bays for widebody aircraft such as Airbus A330/A350/A380-800, Boeing 747/777 and 5 bays for narrow body aircraft, principally Boeing 738/9 and A319/320), 4 remote parking bays (for turboprop aircraft such as Fokker 50, DHC-6-300/400 Twin Otter and ATR 72-500/600), plus 3 new aircraft parking bays located at the general aviation section.\n[[File:MAS747KIA.jpg|thumb|left|Malaysia Airlines Boeing 747 on the runway]]\n[[File:KIA Control Tower.jpg|thumb|Control Tower]]\n[[File:KIA newterminal.jpg|thumb|The Terminal Building]]\n\n== Expansion, renovation and redevelopment ==\nKuching International Airport was given a radical makeover, with the terminal completed in 2006 and the runway and taxiway extension fully completed in 2008.<ref name=\"asia-airports.com\">[http://asia-airports.com/malaysia/kch/index.php Global Asia Airports: Kuching International Airport, Malaysia]</ref> The renovations borrowed many design features from Kuala Lumpur's then-new airport (KL International Airport opened in 1998, replacing the overcrowded Subang-Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport), so the two have a similar look.<ref name=\"asia-airports.com\" />\n\nThe renovation increased terminal building floor space to {{convert|46000|m2}} and was completed 15 months ahead of schedule. The fully renovated terminal building was officially opened by the then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] on Monday, 17 April 2006. The project was handled by Global Upline Sdn. Bhd. and it cost some MYR620,000,000 (US$186,000,000). With this, the airport is capable of handling widebody aircraft such as Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A380-800 (albeit with airside restrictions on the runway and taxiway network).\n\nThe completed works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, extension of the runway length from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel taxiway to a full parallel taxiway with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of taxiway fillets and shoulders to 30 metres. The air-side apron works included the construction of a cargo apron, high-intensity lightings and markings.

He credits the song as being one of the first song he learned and performed on stage prior to forming the [[Rolling Stones]].\n\nMoving to [[Hollywood]], he recorded for several other labels and had several almost-comebacks; his 1964 version of Hazlewood's \"[[Houston (song)|Houston]]\" was eclipsed by [[Dean Martin]]'s version, and in 1965 he re-recorded \"The Fool\" with [[Waylon Jennings]] on guitar.<ref name=amg/> Hazlewood, by now an established songwriter, signed Clark to his own label, [[LHI Records|LHI]], on which Clark released ''The Black Widow'' b/w ''[[The Son of Hickory Holler's Tramp]]'' in 1967, ''Farm Labor Camp #2'' and the album ''Return of the Fool'' in 1968.\n\nA few years later Clark left the music business, working in construction, though he occasionally recorded in later decades on his own label, [[Desert Sun Records]].\n\n\"The Fool\" has been recorded by [[Chris Farlowe]] (1965 single), [[Elvis Presley]] for ''[[Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old)]]'' (1971), [[The Animals]] for ''[[Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted]]'' (1977) and by [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] on ''[[1000 Years of Popular Music]]'' (live) among many others.\n\n== TV and film ==\nClark's most popular and well-known song, \"The Fool,\" was featured in the [[Netflix]] film [[Win It All]] (2017) and the [[Focus Features]] film [[Dallas Buyers Club]] (2013). His song \"Calling All Hearts\" has been played in various TV and film productions including the [[NBC]] series [[Aquarius (U.S. TV series)|Aquarius]]: Episode 107, the [[ABC Studios|ABC]] series [[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]: Episode 310,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/nashville/season-3/20709|title=Music from Nashville S3E10|website=Tunefind.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> the [[FXX]] series [[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]: Episode 1209, and in the [[20th Century Fox]] film, [[Walking with Dinosaurs (film)|Walking With Dinosaurs]] (2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrackmania.net/walking-with-dinosaurs-soundtrack-list.html|title=Walking With Dinosaurs 3D Soundtrack List|website=Soundtrackmania.net|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> His song \"The Big Lie\" was featured in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] series [[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]: Episode 409, in the [[Freestyle Releasing]] film [[From the Rough]] (2011), and in [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] film [[The Driftless Area]] (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ringostrack.com/en/movie/the-driftless-area/87015|title=The Driftless Area (2015) Soundtrack|website=RingosTrack.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref> \"Bad Case of You\" was featured in the [[Amazon Studios]] series [[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]: Episode 308 and 310.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/artist/sanford-clark|title=Music by Sanford Clark|website=Tunefind.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Discography==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/578983-Sanford-Clark|title=Sanford Clark|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One of them, ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' (1842) by [[Richard Wagner]], eventually became more famous than the novel. ''Leonora'' (1846) by [[William Henry Fry]], the first European-styled \"grand\" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'', as is [[Frederic Cowen]]'s first opera ''[[Pauline (opera)|Pauline]]'' (1876). Verdi rival [[Errico Petrella]]'s most successful opera, ''[[Jone (opera)|Jone]]'' (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', and was performed all over the world until the First World War. ''Harold, the Last of the Saxons'' (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera ''[[Aroldo]]'' in 1857.\n\n===Magazines===\nIn addition to his political and literary work, Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the ''New Monthly'' in 1831, but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the ''Monthly Chronicle'', a semi-scientific magazine.

Verdi rival [[Errico Petrella]]'s most successful opera, ''[[Jone (opera)|Jone]]'' (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', and was performed all over the world until the First World War.

During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was ''Kenelm Chillingly'', which was in course of publication in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood\u2019s Magazine]]'' at the time of his death in 1873.{{sfn|Waugh|1911|p=186}}\n\n===Translations===\nBulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by [[Laza Kostic]]), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his ''Ernest Maltravers'' was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keene |first=Donald |title=Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature of the Modern Era |year=1984 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York |isbn=0030628148 |page=62}}</ref>\n\n===Place names===\nIn Queensland, Australia the Brisbane suburb of Lytton is to be found on Bulwer Island which today is home to the Port of Brisbane.\nAlso in Queensland on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) is located another settlement by the name of Bulwer.\nThe township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of [[Montcerf-Lytton, Quebec|Montcerf-Lytton]]) was named after him<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=37667 |language=French |title=Lytton |publisher=[[Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec]] |work=Banque de noms de lieux du Qu\u00e9bec |accessdate=16 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173531/http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/CT/toposweb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=37667 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> as was [[Lytton, British Columbia]], and Lytton, Iowa.

Her music blends [[British soul]] and jazz-tinged blues over subtle R&B melodies. In late 2019, she won both a [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] and a [[BBC Music Awards|BBC Music Award]] and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2020 in an annual [[BBC]] poll of music critics, [[Sound of 2020]]. Since 2017, Celeste has released two extended plays and has supported [[Michael Kiwanuka]] on tour. She has performed at some of Europe's biggest festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[Primavera Sound]], [[Field Day (festival)|Field Day]], and [[Rock en Seine]], and has been included in lists of artists to watch in 2020 by publications like ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']], ''[[NME]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''[[MTV]]'', ''[[Vevo]]'' and ''[[Amazon Music]]''.\n\nAt the age of 16, Celeste caught the attention of a manager after uploading a self-written tribute to her late father to [[YouTube]]. After graduating, Celeste released her debut single \"Daydreaming\" on the [[Lily Allen]]-owned record label Bank Holiday in 2016. In March 2017, she released her debut EP ''The Milk & the Honey'' under the same label before completing a month-long residency at Laylow in [[Ladbroke Grove]].

It stars [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Tony Jaa]], [[Michael Jai White]], and [[Ron Perlman]]. Lundgren wrote the film with [[Gabriel Dowrick]] and [[Steven Elder]], while [[John Hyams]] performed uncredited script revisions. The film centers around New Jersey police detective Nick Cassidy, as he travels to Asia intent on killing the man who murdered his family, mobster Viktor Dragovic.<ref name=KenberInterview/>\n\nDevelopment started in 2007 after Lundgren read a news report about a group of girls being smuggled into the United States from Mexico. The girls were left in a vehicle along the border and, trapped inside, they all died of heat stroke and suffocation. ''Skin Trade'' had a $9 million production budget, and was shot over 50 days in Canada and Thailand.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[American Film Market]] on November 7, 2014. This was followed by a limited theatrical release, starting on April 9, 2015 in the United Arab Emirates, and succeeded by Thailand (on April 23), Malaysia (on April 30), and the United States (on May 8). The film grossed $384 thousand at the worldwide box office, but received mostly negative reviews; particular criticism was aimed at Jaa's fluency in English, as well as the film's approach to the topic of [[human trafficking]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn the prologue, a Cambodian girl leaves her village for Bangkok. Upon arriving, she is drugged, kidnapped and sold into the \"skin trade\" (human trafficking).\n\nIn Newark city, Nick Cassidy - a Newark Police Department detective - discovers that Viktor Dragovic - a Serbian mobster - is in New Jersey. Meanwhile, in Bangkok, detective Tony Vitayakul attempts to buy a Thai girl from a group of human traffickers. When his cover is blown, he subdues the traffickers and frees the girl. He collects information regarding the ship used to transport trafficked girls, its destination, and that Dragovic will be there to receive the shipment.\n\nCassidy and his superior officer - Captain Costello - brief a group of police officers on Dragovic, revealing he is a major player in human trafficking worldwide. As the ship carrying Dragovic's container approaches the US, Cassidy and his men prepare to intercept it at the dock. When the ship arrives, Dragovic discovers the trafficked women have died during the transport. The ship's captain is held responsible, tortured and shot in the head. A shootout erupts as the police move in. Cassidy chases Dragovic and Andre - his youngest son. He fatally shoots Andre in self-defense and Dragovic is arrested. While in custody, Dragovic arranges to have Cassidy's family murdered and his house blown up. Cassidy's wife and daughter are killed while Cassidy survives, despite being shot in the back.\n\nCaptain Costello and Agent Reed - an FBI agent - visit Cassidy in the hospital. They tell him Dragovic fled the US after being bailed. After they leave, Cassidy steals an opiate drug and clothing before leaving the hospital unnoticed. He gets his guns and goes to the restaurant of Dragovic's attorney. After forcing the attorney to reveal Dragovic's whereabouts, Cassidy shoots him and blows up the restaurant.\n\nIn Cambodia, Senator Khat warns Dragovic that unless he leaves the country immediately, he will be arrested and extradited to the US. Dragovic blackmails the Senator into giving him two weeks to put his affairs in order and flee.\n\nCassidy travels to Thailand in pursuit of Dragovic. Believing that Cassidy has experienced a nervous breakdown, the US authorities have sent Reed to detain him. Tony and Nung - his partner - are ordered to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy runs away from the police. Reed, who has been bribed by Dragovic, kills Nung and blames Cassidy for the murder. Vitayakul pursues Cassidy through the streets but fails to capture him. Cassidy reaches a nightclub in Poipet. After torturing one of Dragovic's men, he discovers the location of Dragovic's current operations. Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, an injured Cassidy escapes again. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's cell phone to discover an informant: Min - Vitayakul's girlfriend. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's illegitimate son, who oversees Dragovic's human trafficking business in southeast Asian, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father. Vitayakul arrives to kill Cassidy, but after learning the truth about his partner's death, he fights and kills Reed instead. Janko reveals his father's location before dying.\n\nThe next day, Cassidy and Vitayakul team up and storm Dragovic's compound. Ivan is holding Min at gunpoint, but Vitayakul shoots him. Cassidy destroys a vehicle with a rocket launcher. As a result, Dragovic's helicopter leaves without him. During a shootout between the two detectives and Dragovic's men, Goran is killed in a hand-to-hand fight with Vitayakul. After that, Cassidy fights with Dragovic, ultimately stabbing him in the chest, despite Dragovic commandeering a second helicopter. Dragovic then tells Cassidy that Sofia - his daughter - was not killed, but instead sold into the human trafficking trade. He fails to learn the whereabouts of his daughter from the dying Dragovic.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cassidy says goodbye to Vitayakul and Min. He gives them a picture of Sofia and asks them to keep it until he finds her. He then sets out in search of his daughter on his own.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:SkinTrade2014.maincast.png|thumb|right|upright=0.80|alt=|Clockwise: Dolph Lundgren, Tony Jaa, Ron Perlman, and Michael Jai White.]]\n\n*[[Dolph Lundgren]] as Detective Nick Cassidy, a New Jersey police detective seeking to avenge the murder of his family\n*[[Tony Jaa]] as Detective Tony Vitayakul, a Thailand police detective tasked with arresting Cassidy\n*[[Michael Jai White]] as Agent Reed, an FBI agent\n*[[Ron Perlman]] as Viktor Dragovic, a Serbian war criminal also a mobster running an international human trafficking ring\n*[[Mike Dopud]] as Goran Dragovic, Viktor's eldest son, who oversees his father's operations in the Middle-East\n*David Westerman as Ivan Dragovic, Viktor's other son, who oversees his father's operations in South-East Asia\n*Leo Rano as Janko Dragovic, Viktor's son from another relationship, who manages a chain of nightclubs in Thailand\n*Michael G.

It stars [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Tony Jaa]], [[Michael Jai White]], and [[Ron Perlman]]. Lundgren wrote the film with [[Gabriel Dowrick]] and [[Steven Elder]], while [[John Hyams]] performed uncredited script revisions. The film centers around New Jersey police detective Nick Cassidy, as he travels to Asia intent on killing the man who murdered his family, mobster Viktor Dragovic.<ref name=KenberInterview/>\n\nDevelopment started in 2007 after Lundgren read a news report about a group of girls being smuggled into the United States from Mexico. The girls were left in a vehicle along the border and, trapped inside, they all died of heat stroke and suffocation. ''Skin Trade'' had a $9 million production budget, and was shot over 50 days in Canada and Thailand.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[American Film Market]] on November 7, 2014. This was followed by a limited theatrical release, starting on April 9, 2015 in the United Arab Emirates, and succeeded by Thailand (on April 23), Malaysia (on April 30), and the United States (on May 8). The film grossed $384 thousand at the worldwide box office, but received mostly negative reviews; particular criticism was aimed at Jaa's fluency in English, as well as the film's approach to the topic of [[human trafficking]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn the prologue, a Cambodian girl leaves her village for Bangkok. Upon arriving, she is drugged, kidnapped and sold into the \"skin trade\" (human trafficking).\n\nIn Newark city, Nick Cassidy - a Newark Police Department detective - discovers that Viktor Dragovic - a Serbian mobster - is in New Jersey. Meanwhile, in Bangkok, detective Tony Vitayakul attempts to buy a Thai girl from a group of human traffickers. When his cover is blown, he subdues the traffickers and frees the girl. He collects information regarding the ship used to transport trafficked girls, its destination, and that Dragovic will be there to receive the shipment.\n\nCassidy and his superior officer - Captain Costello - brief a group of police officers on Dragovic, revealing he is a major player in human trafficking worldwide. As the ship carrying Dragovic's container approaches the US, Cassidy and his men prepare to intercept it at the dock. When the ship arrives, Dragovic discovers the trafficked women have died during the transport. The ship's captain is held responsible, tortured and shot in the head. A shootout erupts as the police move in. Cassidy chases Dragovic and Andre - his youngest son. He fatally shoots Andre in self-defense and Dragovic is arrested. While in custody, Dragovic arranges to have Cassidy's family murdered and his house blown up. Cassidy's wife and daughter are killed while Cassidy survives, despite being shot in the back.\n\nCaptain Costello and Agent Reed - an FBI agent - visit Cassidy in the hospital. They tell him Dragovic fled the US after being bailed. After they leave, Cassidy steals an opiate drug and clothing before leaving the hospital unnoticed. He gets his guns and goes to the restaurant of Dragovic's attorney. After forcing the attorney to reveal Dragovic's whereabouts, Cassidy shoots him and blows up the restaurant.\n\nIn Cambodia, Senator Khat warns Dragovic that unless he leaves the country immediately, he will be arrested and extradited to the US. Dragovic blackmails the Senator into giving him two weeks to put his affairs in order and flee.\n\nCassidy travels to Thailand in pursuit of Dragovic. Believing that Cassidy has experienced a nervous breakdown, the US authorities have sent Reed to detain him. Tony and Nung - his partner - are ordered to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy runs away from the police. Reed, who has been bribed by Dragovic, kills Nung and blames Cassidy for the murder. Vitayakul pursues Cassidy through the streets but fails to capture him. Cassidy reaches a nightclub in Poipet. After torturing one of Dragovic's men, he discovers the location of Dragovic's current operations. Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, an injured Cassidy escapes again. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's cell phone to discover an informant: Min - Vitayakul's girlfriend. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's illegitimate son, who oversees Dragovic's human trafficking business in southeast Asian, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father. Vitayakul arrives to kill Cassidy, but after learning the truth about his partner's death, he fights and kills Reed instead. Janko reveals his father's location before dying.\n\nThe next day, Cassidy and Vitayakul team up and storm Dragovic's compound. Ivan is holding Min at gunpoint, but Vitayakul shoots him. Cassidy destroys a vehicle with a rocket launcher. As a result, Dragovic's helicopter leaves without him. During a shootout between the two detectives and Dragovic's men, Goran is killed in a hand-to-hand fight with Vitayakul. After that, Cassidy fights with Dragovic, ultimately stabbing him in the chest, despite Dragovic commandeering a second helicopter. Dragovic then tells Cassidy that Sofia - his daughter - was not killed, but instead sold into the human trafficking trade. He fails to learn the whereabouts of his daughter from the dying Dragovic.\n\nIn the aftermath, Cassidy says goodbye to Vitayakul and Min. He gives them a picture of Sofia and asks them to keep it until he finds her. He then sets out in search of his daughter on his own.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:SkinTrade2014.maincast.png|thumb|right|upright=0.80|alt=|Clockwise: Dolph Lundgren, Tony Jaa, Ron Perlman, and Michael Jai White.]]\n\n*[[Dolph Lundgren]] as Detective Nick Cassidy, a New Jersey police detective seeking to avenge the murder of his family\n*[[Tony Jaa]] as Detective Tony Vitayakul, a Thailand police detective tasked with arresting Cassidy\n*[[Michael Jai White]] as Agent Reed, an FBI agent\n*[[Ron Perlman]] as Viktor Dragovic, a Serbian war criminal also a mobster running an international human trafficking ring\n*[[Mike Dopud]] as Goran Dragovic, Viktor's eldest son, who oversees his father's operations in the Middle-East\n*David Westerman as Ivan Dragovic, Viktor's other son, who oversees his father's operations in South-East Asia\n*Leo Rano as Janko Dragovic, Viktor's son from another relationship, who manages a chain of nightclubs in Thailand\n*Michael G.
