When Yeung took the chairmanship from Martin Lee in 2002, legislator [[Albert Chan]] quit the party, and the following year a number of \"Young Turks\" left the party to join [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]].

The [[Tihamah|Tih\u0101mah]] (\"hot lands\" or \"hot earth\") form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen's entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]] [[mosquito]]s. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use. Near the village of [[Madar, Yemen|Madar]] about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of Sana'a, [[dinosaur]] footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat. The Tihamah ends abruptly at the [[escarpment]] of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year to about {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Taiz and over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Ibb. Temperatures are hot in the day, but fall dramatically at night. Perennial streams occur in the highlands, but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe central highlands are an extensive high plateau over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Sana'a is in this region. The highest point in Yemen and Arabia is [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], at about {{convert|3666|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Burrows2010\"/><ref name=\"Laughlin2008\">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=1: Background |page=3 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&pg |year=2008|ref={{harvid|McLaughlin|2008}} }}</ref>\n\nYemen's portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower, generally below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and receives almost no rain.

The Sudanian element\u2014characterized by relatively high rainfall\u2014dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains. A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions.

The [[President of Yemen|President]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. In Sana'a, a [[Supreme Political Council]] (not recognized internationally) forms the government.\n\nThe 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years.

The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana'a. [[Sharia]] is the main source of laws, with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities.

The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government.

The seaborne transit trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the closure of the [[Suez Canal]] and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in 1967.\n\nSince the conclusion of the war, the government made an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to implement a [[structural adjustment]] program. Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two addresses structural issues, such as civil service reform.\n\nIn early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the [[World Bank]] and the IMF, as well as international donors. These programs had a positive impact on Yemen's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product during the period 1995\u20131999 and the correction of macro-financial imbalances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/NP/prsp/2000/yem/01/123100.pdf |title=Republic of Yemen: Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=December 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6% from 1995 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pfp/1999/yemen/index.htm#I |title=Republic of Yemen Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Medium-Term Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper 1999\u20132001 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=5 March 1999 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Yemen}}\n\nA key challenge is severe [[Environmental impacts of the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|water scarcity]], especially in the Highlands, prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to write \"Yemen could become first nation to run out of water.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|title=Yemen could become first nation to run out of water|last=Evans|first=Judith|date=21 October 2009|work=The Times|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170311100235/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|archive-date=11 March 2017|url-status=live|language=en-gb}}</ref> A second key challenge is a high level of poverty, making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision.

Both amateur and professional (government-sponsored) theatre troupes perform in the country's major urban centres. Many of Yemen's significant poets and authors, like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir, Muhammad al-Sharafi, and [[Wajdi al-Ahdal]], have written dramatic works; poems, novels, and short stories by Yemeni authors like [[Mohammad Abdul-Wali]] and [[Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh]] have also been adapted for the stage. There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] and by Western authors, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Pirandello]], [[Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]. Historically speaking, the southern port city of Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre; in recent decades the capital, Sana'a, has hosted numerous theatre festivals, often in conjunction with [[World Theatre Day]].\n\n===Sport===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Yemen. The [[Yemen Football Association]] is a member of [[FIFA]] and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]. The [[Yemen national football team|Yemeni national football team]] participates internationally. The country also hosts many football clubs. They compete in the national and international leagues.\n\nYemen's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as [[Mountain biking|biking]], [[rock climbing]], [[trekking]], [[hiking]], and other more challenging sports, including [[mountain climbing]].

Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.\n\n[[Camel jumping]] is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the [[Red Sea]]. Camels are placed side to side and victory goes to the competitor who leaps, from a running start, over the most camels. The jumpers train year round for competitions. Tribesmen (women may not compete) tuck their robes around their waists for freedom of movement while running and leaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The-Sport-of-Camel-Jumping.html |title=The Sport of Camel Jumping |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=September 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nYemen's biggest sports event was hosting the [[20th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in Aden and Abyan in the southern part of the country on 22 November 2010.

Sana'a became a major Islamic centre in the 7th century, and the 103 mosques, 14 hammams (traditional bathhouses), and more than 6,000 houses that survive all date from before the 11th century.\n\nClose to the Red Sea Coast, the historic town of [[Zabid]], inscribed in 1993, was Yemen's capital from the 13th to the 15th century, and is an archaeological and historical site. It played an important role for many centuries because of its university, which was a centre of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world. Algebra is said to have been invented there in the early 9th century by the little-known scholar [[Al-Jazari]].\n\nThe latest addition to Yemen's list of World Heritage Sites is the [[Socotra]] Archipelago. Mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as a range of ''[[Aloe]]s'' and the Dragon's Blood Tree (''[[Dracaena cinnabari]]'').

Total expenditures on health care in 2004 constituted 5% of gross domestic product. In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low compared with other [[Middle East]]ern countries \u2013 US$34 per capita according to the [[World Health Organization]].\n\nThe number of doctors in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7% between 1995 and 2000. {{As of|2005|lc=y}} there were three doctors per 10,000 people. In 2005 Yemen had 6.1 hospital beds available per 10,000 persons. Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas. 25% of rural areas are covered by health services, compared with 80% of urban areas. Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which vaccines exist or that are otherwise preventable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Yemen.pdf |title=Country Profile: Yemen, August 2008 |publisher=Library of Congress |date=August 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nCirca 2009 Sana'a may be the first capital city in the world to run out of drinking water.<ref>Sweetland Edwards, Haley (11 October 2009).

During the mid-2000s Yemen decided to take a market-based approach to their healthcare system due to increased liberalization within the country.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal |last1=Fuss |first1=Matthew |title=Increasing Health Care Access in Yemen Through Community-Based Health Insurance |journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies |date=2016 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=795 |url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol23/iss2/14|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.23.2.0795|id={{ebsco|119434140}}}}</ref> However, this market based approach directly affected the poor and those living in rural areas, because of a decrease in Yemen's budget in public healthcare and use of user fees.<ref name=\":02\" /> Access to healthcare services is highly determined by geographic location. Although Yemen's constitution promises healthcare for all, only 25% of those living in rural areas have access to healthcare services compared to the 80% that have access to healthcare services in urban areas.<ref name=\":02\" /> In addition, most hospitals are in urban areas which makes accessibility difficult for those living in rural areas. Yemen's public healthcare system is compiled of four levels: (1) 2929 primary health care units (2) 184 district hospitals (3) 53 general hospitals (4) two specialist referral hospitals. However, many of these facilities lack resources and employees due to the small budget spent on public healthcare in Yemen.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, in 2002 Yemen created the District [[Healthcare]] System (DHS) in order to deliver primary health care through community-based services, which in the end failed due to poor management. On the other hand, Yemen's private sector has succeeded: there were 167 private hospitals in 2002 and by 2012 there were 746 private hospitals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Yemen's healthcare system prior to the current conflict was weak, however, still better than currently.\n\n=== During the crisis ===\nCurrently, only 45% of healthcare facilities in Yemen are functioning and accessible to the public, while, 247 of healthcare facilities have been destroyed and damaged by the ongoing conflict.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/02/552032-yemens-health-system-another-victim-conflict-un-health-agency|title=Yemen's health system another victim of the conflict \u2013 UN health agency|date=2017-02-23|website=UN News|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> In addition, healthcare facilities that are still functioning lack the resources and employees to provide the appropriate healthcare service because humanitarian aide is restricted by the constant fighting, airstrikes, bombardments, and lack of ceasefire.

Yemen then made significant progress, with the rate falling to 44.5 children per 1000 births in 2015. Subsequently, the ongoing [[2016\u201319 Yemen cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] caused the death toll of children to rise. As of 2018, more than 20 million Yemeni people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 9 million children.\n\nMalnutrition is one of the leading causes of child mortality. By 2018, about two million Yemeni children suffered from acute malnutrition, as a result of the civil war consuming their nation's economy. Geographically, Yemen also has the world's most depleted water sources. According to UNICEF, nearly 462,000 children are suffering from [[Severe Acute Malnutrition]]. By November 2018, an estimated 85,000 children under the age of five had died due to acute malnutrition over the three years of the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983|title=Huge malnutrition toll on Yemen children|date=21 November 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> This number does not include children missing, displaced, or currently medically unstable.\n\nAbuse and the exploitation of children in Yemen has become common practice with the continuation of the civil war between the [[Houthi movement|Houthi]] rebels and Yemeni government forces. A reported 6,500 children have been killed or injured from violence as the country's infrastructure collapses. It is reported that upwards of 800 children being recruited to participate in the civil war.\n\n===Disease===\nCholera has broken out within Yemen because of its poor infrastructure that deteriorated due wide spread war in the country. Yemen faces issues in control and provisions of fresh, clean water as Yemen does not have the capacity to create the infrastructure needed to provide it; thus, people are forced to obtain unsanitary water from rivers, lakes, and wells. Cholera is prominently found in contaminated drinking water, making the Yemeni people, especially children, the most prone to such a disease. There have been more than 815,000 suspected cases of Cholera in Yemen over the past three years, 60% percent of them being children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year|title=Yemen's cholera outbreak now the worst in history as millionth case looms|first=Kate|last=Lyons|date=12 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Cholera can be found throughout a majority of Yemen, mostly concentrated in the cities closest to water.

The [[Tihamah|Tih\u0101mah]] (\"hot lands\" or \"hot earth\") form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen's entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]] [[mosquito]]s. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use. Near the village of [[Madar, Yemen|Madar]] about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of Sana'a, [[dinosaur]] footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat. The Tihamah ends abruptly at the [[escarpment]] of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year to about {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Taiz and over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Ibb. Temperatures are hot in the day, but fall dramatically at night. Perennial streams occur in the highlands, but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe central highlands are an extensive high plateau over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Sana'a is in this region. The highest point in Yemen and Arabia is [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], at about {{convert|3666|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Burrows2010\"/><ref name=\"Laughlin2008\">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=1: Background |page=3 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&pg |year=2008|ref={{harvid|McLaughlin|2008}} }}</ref>\n\nYemen's portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower, generally below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and receives almost no rain.

The Sudanian element\u2014characterized by relatively high rainfall\u2014dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains. A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions.

The [[President of Yemen|President]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. In Sana'a, a [[Supreme Political Council]] (not recognized internationally) forms the government.\n\nThe 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years.

The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified. The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana'a. [[Sharia]] is the main source of laws, with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities.

The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt. Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970. At the same time, Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes, which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government.

The seaborne transit trade, which the port relied upon, collapsed with the closure of the [[Suez Canal]] and Britain's withdrawal from Aden in 1967.\n\nSince the conclusion of the war, the government made an agreement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) to implement a [[structural adjustment]] program. Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two addresses structural issues, such as civil service reform.\n\nIn early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the [[World Bank]] and the IMF, as well as international donors. These programs had a positive impact on Yemen's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than 3% of gross domestic product during the period 1995\u20131999 and the correction of macro-financial imbalances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/NP/prsp/2000/yem/01/123100.pdf |title=Republic of Yemen: Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=December 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2010}}</ref> The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6% from 1995 to 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pfp/1999/yemen/index.htm#I |title=Republic of Yemen Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility Medium-Term Economic and Financial Policy Framework Paper 1999\u20132001 |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=5 March 1999 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Yemen}}\n\nA key challenge is severe [[Environmental impacts of the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|water scarcity]], especially in the Highlands, prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to write \"Yemen could become first nation to run out of water.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|title=Yemen could become first nation to run out of water|last=Evans|first=Judith|date=21 October 2009|work=The Times|access-date=11 March 2017|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170311100235/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/yemen-could-become-first-nation-to-run-out-of-water-6jvzddjrl0v|archive-date=11 March 2017|url-status=live|language=en-gb}}</ref> A second key challenge is a high level of poverty, making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision.

Both amateur and professional (government-sponsored) theatre troupes perform in the country's major urban centres. Many of Yemen's significant poets and authors, like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir, Muhammad al-Sharafi, and [[Wajdi al-Ahdal]], have written dramatic works; poems, novels, and short stories by Yemeni authors like [[Mohammad Abdul-Wali]] and [[Abdulaziz Al-Maqaleh]] have also been adapted for the stage. There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] and by Western authors, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Pirandello]], [[Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]. Historically speaking, the southern port city of Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre; in recent decades the capital, Sana'a, has hosted numerous theatre festivals, often in conjunction with [[World Theatre Day]].\n\n===Sport===\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Yemen. The [[Yemen Football Association]] is a member of [[FIFA]] and [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]. The [[Yemen national football team|Yemeni national football team]] participates internationally. The country also hosts many football clubs. They compete in the national and international leagues.\n\nYemen's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as [[Mountain biking|biking]], [[rock climbing]], [[trekking]], [[hiking]], and other more challenging sports, including [[mountain climbing]].

Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.\n\n[[Camel jumping]] is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the [[Red Sea]]. Camels are placed side to side and victory goes to the competitor who leaps, from a running start, over the most camels. The jumpers train year round for competitions. Tribesmen (women may not compete) tuck their robes around their waists for freedom of movement while running and leaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/The-Sport-of-Camel-Jumping.html |title=The Sport of Camel Jumping |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=September 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nYemen's biggest sports event was hosting the [[20th Arabian Gulf Cup]] in Aden and Abyan in the southern part of the country on 22 November 2010.

Sana'a became a major Islamic centre in the 7th century, and the 103 mosques, 14 hammams (traditional bathhouses), and more than 6,000 houses that survive all date from before the 11th century.\n\nClose to the Red Sea Coast, the historic town of [[Zabid]], inscribed in 1993, was Yemen's capital from the 13th to the 15th century, and is an archaeological and historical site. It played an important role for many centuries because of its university, which was a centre of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world. Algebra is said to have been invented there in the early 9th century by the little-known scholar [[Al-Jazari]].\n\nThe latest addition to Yemen's list of World Heritage Sites is the [[Socotra]] Archipelago. Mentioned by [[Marco Polo]] in the 13th century, this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden. The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as a range of ''[[Aloe]]s'' and the Dragon's Blood Tree (''[[Dracaena cinnabari]]'').

In that same year, the per capita expenditure for health care was very low compared with other [[Middle East]]ern countries \u2013 US$34 per capita according to the [[World Health Organization]].\n\nThe number of doctors in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7% between 1995 and 2000. {{As of|2005|lc=y}} there were three doctors per 10,000 people. In 2005 Yemen had 6.1 hospital beds available per 10,000 persons.

During the mid-2000s Yemen decided to take a market-based approach to their healthcare system due to increased liberalization within the country.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal |last1=Fuss |first1=Matthew |title=Increasing Health Care Access in Yemen Through Community-Based Health Insurance |journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies |date=2016 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=795 |url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol23/iss2/14|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.23.2.0795|id={{ebsco|119434140}}}}</ref> However, this market based approach directly affected the poor and those living in rural areas, because of a decrease in Yemen's budget in public healthcare and use of user fees.<ref name=\":02\" /> Access to healthcare services is highly determined by geographic location. Although Yemen's constitution promises healthcare for all, only 25% of those living in rural areas have access to healthcare services compared to the 80% that have access to healthcare services in urban areas.<ref name=\":02\" /> In addition, most hospitals are in urban areas which makes accessibility difficult for those living in rural areas. Yemen's public healthcare system is compiled of four levels: (1) 2929 primary health care units (2) 184 district hospitals (3) 53 general hospitals (4) two specialist referral hospitals. However, many of these facilities lack resources and employees due to the small budget spent on public healthcare in Yemen.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, in 2002 Yemen created the District [[Healthcare]] System (DHS) in order to deliver primary health care through community-based services, which in the end failed due to poor management. On the other hand, Yemen's private sector has succeeded: there were 167 private hospitals in 2002 and by 2012 there were 746 private hospitals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Yemen's healthcare system prior to the current conflict was weak, however, still better than currently.\n\n=== During the crisis ===\nCurrently, only 45% of healthcare facilities in Yemen are functioning and accessible to the public, while, 247 of healthcare facilities have been destroyed and damaged by the ongoing conflict.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/02/552032-yemens-health-system-another-victim-conflict-un-health-agency|title=Yemen's health system another victim of the conflict \u2013 UN health agency|date=2017-02-23|website=UN News|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> In addition, healthcare facilities that are still functioning lack the resources and employees to provide the appropriate healthcare service because humanitarian aide is restricted by the constant fighting, airstrikes, bombardments, and lack of ceasefire.

Yemen then made significant progress, with the rate falling to 44.5 children per 1000 births in 2015. Subsequently, the ongoing [[2016\u201319 Yemen cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak]] caused the death toll of children to rise. As of 2018, more than 20 million Yemeni people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 9 million children.\n\nMalnutrition is one of the leading causes of child mortality. By 2018, about two million Yemeni children suffered from acute malnutrition, as a result of the civil war consuming their nation's economy. Geographically, Yemen also has the world's most depleted water sources. According to UNICEF, nearly 462,000 children are suffering from [[Severe Acute Malnutrition]]. By November 2018, an estimated 85,000 children under the age of five had died due to acute malnutrition over the three years of the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983|title=Huge malnutrition toll on Yemen children|date=21 November 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> This number does not include children missing, displaced, or currently medically unstable.\n\nAbuse and the exploitation of children in Yemen has become common practice with the continuation of the civil war between the [[Houthi movement|Houthi]] rebels and Yemeni government forces. A reported 6,500 children have been killed or injured from violence as the country's infrastructure collapses. It is reported that upwards of 800 children being recruited to participate in the civil war.\n\n===Disease===\nCholera has broken out within Yemen because of its poor infrastructure that deteriorated due wide spread war in the country. Yemen faces issues in control and provisions of fresh, clean water as Yemen does not have the capacity to create the infrastructure needed to provide it; thus, people are forced to obtain unsanitary water from rivers, lakes, and wells. Cholera is prominently found in contaminated drinking water, making the Yemeni people, especially children, the most prone to such a disease. There have been more than 815,000 suspected cases of Cholera in Yemen over the past three years, 60% percent of them being children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year|title=Yemen's cholera outbreak now the worst in history as millionth case looms|first=Kate|last=Lyons|date=12 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Cholera can be found throughout a majority of Yemen, mostly concentrated in the cities closest to water.

They've supplied 565 tons of essential vaccines and medical supplies expected to help upwards of 3 million people in conflict impacted areas.\n\nThe World Health Organization has provided huge efforts by creating its humanitarian response plan in 2017. Their plan consisted of a US$219.2 million WHO budget and a US$430.4 million Health Sector budget that targeted support for 2.6 million women and 5.8 million children in Yemen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/emergencies/response-plans/2017/yemen/en/|title=WHO &#124; Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan 2017|website=WHO}}</ref> They created four specific objectives in providing aid: Provide health services, response and supervision, and medical supplies to districts; Strengthen health sector efficiency and health information systems; Increase reproductive, maternal, newborn, and adolescent health interventions, including violence against women; Bolster community-based health initiatives and create self-sustaining infrastructure for the health system.
