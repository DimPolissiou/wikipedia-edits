Kim Byunk-kee, Kim Won Hong, identified as deputy director of North Korea's General Political Bureau (GPB), was reportedly punished along with the director of that bureau, identified as Hwang Pyong So. The form of punishment was unspecified.<ref>Berlinger, Joshua and Taephoon, Lee. http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/21/asia/north-korea-military-punishments/index.html</ref>\n\nDespite being punished he did appear at an April 2017 parade, though when [[Kim Jong-Un]] walked by it appeared he was ignored possibly indicating he had lost some favor with him. In May 2017, he was appointed to Deputy Director of the KPA General Political Department. In September he was under investigation again and removed from the position with the WPK Organization Guidance Department. During April and May 2018, he lost his positions as WPK Political Bureau, WPK Central Military Commission and the State Affairs Commission.<ref>http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/leadership-biographies/gen-kim-won-hong/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n|-\n{{s-vac|last=[[Ri Chun-su]]<br><small>[[U Tong-chuk]] as first vice-minister</small>}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[State Security Department|Minister of State Security]]|years=2012\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-mil}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Won Ung-hui]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Commander of the Military Security Command|years=2003\u20132009}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Jo Kyong-chol]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kim, Won-hong}}\n[[Category:North Korean military personnel]]\n[[Category:1945 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Supreme People's Assembly]]\n[[Category:Workers' Party of Korea politicians]]\n[[Category:People from North Hwanghae]]\n", "name_user": "Rakoon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Won-hong"}
