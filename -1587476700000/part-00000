Italian is known as the ''language of music'' because of its use in [[musical terminology]] and [[opera]].

The incorporation into Italian of learned words from its own ancestor language, [[Classical Latin|Latin]], is another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language, scientific terminology and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Italians were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing\u2014and eventually speech\u2014in Italian. Its vowels are the second-closest to Latin after [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].<ref>See [[Classification of Romance languages|''Italica'' 1950: 46]] (cf.

According to this system (illustrated by seven charts at the end of the article), the percentage of change is greatest in French (44%) and least in Italian (12%) and Sardinian (8%).

The earliest attempt was made in 1949 by Mario Pei (1901\u20131978), who measured the divergence of seven modern Romance languages from Classical Latin, taking as his criterion the evolution of stressed vowels. Pei's results do not show the degree of contemporary divergence among the languages from each other but only the divergence of each one from Classical Latin. The closest language turned out to be Sardinian with 8% of change.

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language, led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

[[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian\u2013Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\n{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}\n\nStarting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. -->\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[\u0280]}}, {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, or {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il M\u00aaPI \u2013 Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 978-88-08-24624-0}}</ref>\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].\n\nThe [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0292]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is also known as '''Emu Plains (Nepean River) Underbridge''' and '''Penrith (Nepean River) Underbridge'''.

By 1900 certain sections of [[John Whitton]]'s single track railway network were operating at or near saturation, these included the famous [[Lithgow Zig Zag|Zig Zag]] near [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], the Main West from [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] right through to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], the [[Main Southern railway line, New South Wales|Main South]] from [[Picton, New South Wales|Picton]] as far as [[Harden, New South Wales|Harden]] and the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North]] between [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] and [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales|Muswellbrook]]. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested by the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The Line was duplicated through Lithgow to [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] in 1891 and then onto [[Wallerawang]] in 1922.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\n[[Truss bridge|Pratt Trusses]] were introduced to Australia from the [[United States]] in 1892 with the construction of the light-rail [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] Tramway. Thereafter they became the standard for Main Line railways for spans over {{convert|30|m}}. While previous forms of truss had lent themselves to construction from timber, with stocky timber sections with good compressive and buckling resistance forming the diagonal members, the Pratt Truss reversed the direction of load in the diagonal members, enabling light rods or flat bars to be used in tension, making steel trusses highly efficient. The New South Wales railways continued to employ the use of steel Pratt trusses for major bridge crossings until the advent of reinforced and prestressed concrete in the 1970s.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\nThe original railway, of the John Whitton era, crossed this river in 1867 on a massive wrought iron girder bridge. It was built for double track but only ever carried a single track with the adjacent space used for single lane road traffic. By the turn of the century, single line working was inadequate for the increasing traffic and the old bridge would not be strong enough for the steady increase in locomotive sizes and weight. Additional river piers in the river, as was done upstream at [[Menangle, New South Wales|Menangle]], was not considered appropriate so the decision was made to build a new heavy duty truss bridge and let the old bridge be used for two-way road traffic. That is still the current arrangement.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\nJames Fraser, a future Commissioner, designed the new bridge as a series of double track, American Pratt trusses for double the locomotive weights so as to allow for future increases without building another expensive replacement.<ref name=nswshr-1830/> Fraser joined the New South Wales Government Railways and Tramways in 1881 and rose to be engineer-in-chief for existing lines (1903\u201314), assistant-commissioner for railways (1914\u201316), chief railway commissioner (1917\u201329) and transport commissioner (1931\u201332).

When completed, the linking members over the piers were removed and the bridge became five independent spans.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Nepean River Underbridge has research significance as the two parallel bridges demonstrate the evolution of railway bridge construction design during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Nepean River Underbridge is an excellent representative example of a Pratt truss railway viaduct construction, a technology introduced to the NSW rail network with the changeover to American bridge technology in 1892.<ref name=nswshr-1830/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering}}}}\n*[[Victoria Bridge (Penrith)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|last=Fraser|first=Don|date=1995|title=Bridges Down Under}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fraser|first=D.|date=2000|title=Report on the S170 Register of Railway Underbridges for the Rail Infrastructure Corporation}}\n* {{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=John|date=|title=Historical Notes for the Main West Railway, 1960s}}\n* {{cite book|author=State Rail Authority|date=1999|title=State Rail Authority Heritage Register Study|number=SRA576}}\n* {{cite book|author=Hughes Trueman Pty Ltd|date=2009|title=RailCorp Section 170 Register Update|number=}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Emu Plains (Nepean River) Underbridge|dno=5061198|id=1830|year=2018|accessdate=14 October 2018}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Penrith, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1907]]\n[[Category:1907 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Main Western railway line, New South Wales]]\n", "name_user": "Dave Rave", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttribution", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_Plains_Underbridge"}

It consists of an apsidal hall with stupa. The columns slope inwards in the imitation of wooden columns that would have been structurally necessary to keep a roof up. The ceiling is [[barrel vault]]ed with ancient wooden ribs set into them. The walls are polished in the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] style. It was faced by a substantial wooden [[facade]], now entirely lost. A large horseshoe-shaped window, the chaitya-window, was set above the arched doorway and the whole portico-area was carved to imitate a multi-storeyed building with balconies and windows and sculptured men and women who observed the scene below. This created the appearance of an ancient Indian mansion.<ref>[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maha_bhajacaves.asp ASI, \"Bhaja Caves\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810133406/http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maha_bhajacaves.asp |date=10 August 2013 }}; Michell, 352;Dehejia</ref>\n\nChaitya is 26 feet 8 inches wide and 59 feet long, with semi-circular apse at back, and having aisle 3 feet 5 inches wide, separated from the nave by 27 octagonal shaft. 11 feet 4 inches height.
