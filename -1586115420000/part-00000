Retrieved January 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nWith six ''Mario Kart'' games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with [[Namco]] and one for mobile phones, the ''Mario Kart'' series includes a total of fourteen entries. The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

Retrieved January 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nWith six ''Mario Kart'' games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with [[Namco]] and one for mobile phones, the ''Mario Kart'' series includes a total of fourteen entries. The latest game in the main series, ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', was released on iOS and Android in September 2019. The series has sold over 100 million copies worldwide to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mario kart first logo.png|thumb|right|The original logo, used up until ''Mario Kart Arcade GP 2'']]\nThe first title in the ''Mario Kart'' series, ''[[Super Mario Kart]],'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1992. The development of the first game was overseen by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the Japanese video game designer who created the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as well as many other successful games for Nintendo. Darran Jones of [[Imagine Publishing|NowGamer]] suggests that the original success of ''Super Mario Kart'' was the result of including characters previously seen in ''Mario Bros.'' games, while also being a new type of racing game.<ref name=\"Now Gamer\">{{cite web|title=Super Mario Kart: The Complete History of Nintendo's Kart Racer |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |last=Jones |first=Darran |work=[[NowGamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing|Imagine Publishing Ltd.]] |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625232227/http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148204/super_mario_kart_the_complete_history_of_nintendos_kart_racer.html |archivedate=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MK8 Mario Circuit.jpg|thumb|right|Mario driving upside-down using the anti-gravity mechanic introduced in ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''.]]\nIn the ''Mario Kart'' series, players compete in [[Kart racing|go-kart races]], controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the ''Mario'' franchise. Up to twelve characters can compete in each race; the exact number varies between games.\n\nOne of the features of the series is the use of various [[power-up]] items obtained by driving into item boxes laid out on the course. These power-ups include [[Super Mario (series)#Mushrooms|mushrooms]] to give players a speed boost, [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] Shells to be thrown at opponents, [[banana peel]]s and fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards. The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.<ref name=WM>{{cite web|last=Dan|title=Mario Kart Franchise Retrospective|url=http://www.watchmojo.com/video/title/Mario%20Kart%20Franchise%20Retrospective/|publisher=[[WatchMojo.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2012}}</ref> For example, players lagging far behind may receive more powerful items, such as Bullet Bills which give the player a bigger speed boost depending on the place of the player, while the leader may only receive small defensive items, such as shells or bananas. Called [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|rubber banding]], this gameplay mechanism allows other players or computers a realistic chance to catch up to the leading player. They can also perform driving techniques during the race such as rocket starts, [[slipstream]]ing, and mini-turbos.\n\nAs the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.<ref name=WM/> These changes include:\n\n* ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' introduces 4-player racing, slipstreaming<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mariowiki.com/Slipstreaming|title=Slipstreaming|website=Super Mario Wiki|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref> and [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]].<ref name=WM/> This game also introduced [[Wario]] and [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]] as playable characters, as well as seven new items: the Fake Item Box, Triple Red Shell, Triple Green Shell, Triple Mushroom, Banana Bunch, Golden Mushroom, and the infamous [[blue shell]]. In addition to the three Grand Prix engine classes, Mirror mode is introduced (tracks are flipped laterally) in 100cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' introduces the ability to unlock all of the ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' tracks, as both games use the same [[mode 7]] principle.\n* ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' features [[co-operative]] [[LAN]] play and two-player karts.<ref name=WM/> It also introduces eleven new playable characters ([[Princess Daisy]], [[Birdo]], Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Paratroopa, [[Diddy Kong]], [[Bowser Jr.]], [[Waluigi]], [[Toadette]], [[List of Mario franchise characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]], and [[King Boo]]). The game also features special items that are specific to each character, a feature that was previously accessible only to computer-controlled drivers in the original game and re-introduced in ''Mario Kart Tour''. Finally, this game introduced unlockable characters and karts to the series. Mirror mode is bumped up to 150cc.\n* ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' features [[dual-screen]] play and introduces [[online multiplayer]] (via [[Wi-Fi]]) & retro battle arenas. Shy Guy (exclusive to [[DS Download Play]]), Dry Bones, and [[R.O.B.]] are introduced as playable characters. ''DS'' was also the first ''Mario Kart'' game to feature retro tracks from all previous titles of the series, as well as the first entry in the series to feature mission mode. It also introduces two new items: the Blooper, which temporarily obscures the screens of players in higher places with ink and Bullet Bill, which is given to players in lower places and grants a larger speed boost depending on the position from first place.\n* ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' introduces motion controls, performing tricks, 12-player racing, and [[motorbikes]].<ref name=\"Mario Kart Wii Details\">{{cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | title=Mario Kart Wii Detailed | publisher=1up.com | date=February 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 21, 2013 | author=Sato, Yoshi | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192825/http://www.1up.com/news/mario-kart-wii-detailed | archivedate=October 29, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Six new playable characters were introduced: Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], Funky Kong, Dry Bowser, and two outfits for [[Mii]] characters.

The Mega Mushroom also makes its return after an eleven-year absence.\n\n===Characters===\n{{Main|Characters in the Mario Kart series}}\n''Mario Kart'' mainly features [[List of Mario franchise characters|characters from the ''Mario'' franchise]].

Most are based on existing areas in the ''Mario'' franchise ([[Mushroom Kingdom#Bowser's Castle|Bowser's Castle]] being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], such as Rainbow Road, which usually takes place above a city or in space.<ref name=WM/> Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.<ref name=WM/> Each game's tracks are divided into four \"cups\", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win and they are the Mushroom Cup, the Flower Cup, the Star Cup, and the Special Cup. Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required five laps to finish, seven in ''Mario Kart: Double Dash!!'' when racing on Baby Park, and ''Mario Kart Tour'' with only two. The first game to feature courses from previous games was ''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'', which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game. Starting with ''Mario Kart DS'', each entry in the series has featured 16 \"nitro\" (brand new courses introduced for said game) and 16 \"retro\" tracks (reappearing courses from previous ''Mario Kart'' games), spread across four cups each with four races. The four Retro Grand Prix cups are the Shell Cup, the Banana Cup, the Leaf Cup, and the Lightning Cup. In ''Mario Kart 8'', 16 additional tracks are available across two [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' divided into four additional cups; the Egg Cup, the [[Triforce]] Cup, the Crossing Cup, and the Bell Cup.<ref name=\"MK8 DLC\">{{cite web|last=Farokhmanesh|first=Megan|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/26/6071823/mario-kart-8-link-animal-crossing-dlc|title=Link, F-Zero and Animal Crossing are coming to Mario Kart 8 as DLC|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}</ref> ''Mario Kart Tour'' introduced courses from around the world including [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[London]], [[Vancouver]], and [[New York City]].\n\n===Modes of play===\nEach installment features a variety of different modes. The following four modes recur most often in the series:\n* '''Grand Prix''' \u2013 Players compete in various \"cups,\" of four courses each (five in ''Super Mario Kart'') with [[difficulty levels]] based on the size of the engine, larger engines meaning faster speeds. Before ''Mario Kart 8'' there were four difficulties: 50[[Cubic centimeter|cc]], 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (courses that see their circuits flipped horizontally, originally 100cc Mirror in ''Mario Kart 64''). ''Mario Kart 8'' added a fifth difficulty level: 200cc. Players earn points according to their finishing position in each race and the placement order gets carried over as the new starting grid for the next race. At the end of the cup, the top three players with the most points overall will receive a [[trophy]] in bronze, silver, and gold.\n* '''[[Time trial|Time Trials]]''' \u2013 The player races alone in order to finish any course in the fastest time possible. The best time is then saved as a [[Ghost (video gaming)|ghost]], which the player can race against in later trials. Since ''Mario Kart: Double Dash'', a new function called Staff Ghosts is introduced, Staff Ghosts are members of the Nintendo development team that set staff times for players to try and beat. Upon success, players will unlock Expert Staff Ghosts, which only appeared in ''Mario Kart Wii'' and ''Mario Kart 7'', which unlock characters, vehicles, or stamps once beaten, in addition to viewing ghost data.\n* '''VS Race''' \u2013 Multiple human players race against each other on any course with customized rules such as team racing and item frequency. The mode also includes [[single-player]] VS races and CPU controlled players to compete in VS races as well since ''Mario Kart DS'' (except for ''Mario Kart 7''). ''Super Circuit'', however, features a Quick Run mode, which shares similarities with VS mode.\n* '''Battle''' \u2013 Multiple human players use in-game offensive items (shells, etc.) to battle each other in a closed arena. Each player starts with three [[balloons]] and loses a balloon with every hit sustained; the last player possessing at least one balloon wins. Different battle types were added as the series progressed, as well as single-player battles with CPU controlled players. Starting with ''Mario Kart Wii'', there is a [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] for each battle. For ''Mario Kart 8'', the battles take place on race courses. ''Mario Kart 8 Deluxe'' reintroduces dedicated arenas.\n*'''Online Multiplayer''' \u2013 Players are able to compete in races and battles through online services, such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], [[Nintendo Network]], and [[Nintendo Switch Online]]. Players can also share Time Trial ghosts, and participate in [[tournament]]s. In races and battles, players are matched by VR (VS Rating) and BR (Battle Rating) respectively, which is a number between 0 and 99,999 (only 9,999 in ''Mario Kart Wii''). Players gain or lose points based on their performance in a race or battle. The game attempts to match players with a similar rating.\n\n==List of ''Mario Kart'' games==\n{{VG timeline\n|range1 = 1992-\n|range1_color = #6cbe45 #218800\n| 1992 = ''[[Super Mario Kart]]''\n| 1995 = ''[[VB Mario Kart]]'' (Cancelled)\n| 1996 = ''[[Mario Kart 64]]''\n| 2001 = ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]''\n| 2003 = ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]''\n| 2005a = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP]]''\n| 2005b = ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' \n| 2007 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]''\n| 2014 = ''[[Mario Kart 8]]''\n| 2017a = ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]''\n| 2019 = ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]''\n}}\n\n===Console games=== <!-- includes home and handheld; shortened for brevity -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em; text-align: center\"\n! rowspan = \"2\" | Year !! rowspan=\"2\" | Game !! rowspan=\"2\" | Platform !! colspan=\"5\" |[[Virtual Console]]/<br />[[Nintendo Switch Online]] re-release\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Wii U !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | New 3DS !! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\" | Switch\n|-\n| 1992 || ''[[Super Mario Kart]]'' || [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}}\n|-\n| 1996 ||''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' || [[Nintendo 64|N64]] || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2001 || ''[[Mario Kart: Super Circuit]]'' || [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{Partial|<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\"/>}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2003 || ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' || [[GameCube|GCN]] || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' || [[Nintendo DS|DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{Ya|alt=Yes}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2008 || ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' || [[Wii]] || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Partial|{{dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2011 || ''[[Mario Kart 7]]'' || [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2014 ||''[[Mario Kart 8]]'' || [[Wii U]]|| {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}}\n|-\n| 2017 ||''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]'' || [[Nintendo Switch|Switch]] || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{CNone}} || {{Included|{{Double-dagger}}}}\n|}\n{{legend|#D2FFD2|text=[[File:Green check.svg|13px]]|Available on Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online}}\n{{legend|#FFB|text={{Dagger}}|Available by using backwards compatibility}}\n{{legend|#DDFBFF|text={{Double-dagger}}|Available natively on the console}}\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"SC3DS\">''Mario Kart: Super Circuit'' can be played on Nintendo 3DS systems that feature the Nintendo 3DS Ambassadors program.</ref>\n}}\n\n===Arcade games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP|Mario Kart Arcade GP]]'' (2005, [[Arcade game|Arcade]]) (Co-developed by [[Namco]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP 2|Mario Kart Arcade GP 2]]'' (2007, Arcade) (Co-developed by [[Namco Bandai Games]])\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP DX|Mario Kart Arcade GP DX]]'' (2013, Arcade) (Co-developed by Namco Bandai Games)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arcadeheroes.com/2013/02/05/namco-formally-announces-mario-kart-arcade-grand-prix-dx/|title=Namco Formally Announces Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix DX - Arcade Heroes|date=February 5, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''[[Mario Kart Arcade GP#Mario Kart Arcade GP VR|Mario Kart Arcade GP VR]]'' (2017, Arcade) (by [[Bandai Namco Studios]])<ref name=VRZone>{{cite web|url=http://vrzone-pic.com/en/activity/mariocart.html|title=MARIO KART ARCADE GP VR - VR ZONE SHINJUKU|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-arcade-gp-vr-announced-for-bandai-namcos-virtual-reality-arcade-played-with-htc-vive/|title=Mario Kart Arcade GP VR announced for Bandai Namco's virtual reality arcade, played with HTC Vive - Nintendo Everything|date=June 13, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile games===\n* ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'' (2019)\n\n===Canceled games===\n* ''VB Mario Kart'' was scheduled for the [[Virtual Boy]] in 1995.

Mrs. Lewis, along with her husband Martin, operated \"Little Engines of Lomita\", which sold kits for live steam-engine locomotives. Her engines also appeared in movies, including [[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|\"The Greatest Show on Earth\"]] (1952) and [[Von Ryan's Express|\"Von Ryans Express\"]] (1965). This operation inspired Mrs. Lewis to earn a mechanical engineering degree late in life and to build the museum as a showplace for her products. When built, the museum was the first of its kind West of Denver. The museum was designed to replicate the Boston & Maine's Greenwood Station in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The Museum was donated by Mrs. Lewis to the City of Lomita in honor of her late husband, Martin Lewis, in 1967. On display are a 1902 Baldwin Locomotive, a Southern Pacific tender, a 1910 Union Pacific [[caboose]], and a Santa Fe caboose. The Museum also houses a full-size replica of a 1920s water tower that was constructed in 2000. The museum also incorporates a small public park, which accommodates a Union Pacific boxcar and a Union Oil tank car. The Museum is open Thursday through Sunday. Mrs. Lewis's little engines were featured on a Lawrence Welk show saluting senior citizens. Mary Lou Metzger operated the train, and a song about railroading.\n* 5 Star Comics, Comic store owned by professional wrestler [[Rob Van Dam]]. He moved the store from Lakewood to Lomita.

Mrs. Lewis, along with her husband Martin, operated \"Little Engines of Lomita\", which sold kits for live steam-engine locomotives. Her engines also appeared in movies, including [[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|\"The Greatest Show on Earth\"]] (1952) and [[Von Ryan's Express|\"Von Ryans Express\"]] (1965). This operation inspired Mrs. Lewis to earn a mechanical engineering degree late in life and to build the museum as a showplace for her products. When built, the museum was the first of its kind West of Denver. The museum was designed to replicate the Boston & Maine's Greenwood Station in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The Museum was donated by Mrs. Lewis to the City of Lomita in honor of her late husband, Martin Lewis, in 1967. On display are a 1902 Baldwin Locomotive, a Southern Pacific tender, a 1910 Union Pacific [[caboose]], and a Santa Fe caboose. The Museum also houses a full-size replica of a 1920s water tower that was constructed in 2000. The museum also incorporates a small public park, which accommodates a Union Pacific boxcar and a Union Oil tank car. The Museum is open Thursday through Sunday. Mrs. Lewis's little engines were featured on a Lawrence Welk show saluting senior citizens. Mary Lou Metzger operated the train, and a song about railroading.\n* 5 Star Comics, Comic store owned by professional wrestler [[Rob Van Dam]]. He moved the store from Lakewood to Lomita.

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

It lies at the confluence of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] [[list of rivers of Nigeria|rivers]] and is the capital of [[Kogi State]].<ref name=britannica>{{cite web | title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9048796 | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref> While the [[Oworo people|Oworo]], Bassa kwomu [[Bassa Nge]], [[Igala people|Igala]] and [[Ebira people|Ebira]] are indigenous to the area, other [[ethnic groups of Nigeria]], including the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Bini people|Bini/Edo]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], and [[Nupe people|Nupe]], have recently established themselves.\n\n==Etymology==\nDifferent ethnic groups lay claim to having named the city.\n\n* The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Oworo people|Oworo]] people believe the name comes from ''Ilu Oke Oja'' (\"The settlement located on the hill did not fall\").\n* The [[Hausa people|Hausa]] believe the name comes from ''Loko Ja'' (\"A red corner\") and that the city was named by the emir of [[Zazzau]].\n* The [[Nupe people|Nupe]] believe the name comes from ''Patti Lukongi'' (\"The hill of doves\").\n* The [[Igala people|Igala]] believe the name comes from the expression ''Lewa ka je Eja'' (Come, let's eat fish).\n\n==History==\nThe area that would become Lokoja has been inhabited for thousands of years by people from different ethnic groups prior to the arrival of Europeans. The migrations of these groups to the area could be in part accounted for by its nearness to the banks of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] rivers. Some of the first groups of people to settle in Lokoja were the (Oworo people/yoruba from Ile-Ife), [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Nupe people|Nupe]]. It is said that they migrated from Baro and some parts of present-day [[Niger state]] to the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers. This area eventually became a center of trade.\n\nThe Nupe and [[Zazzau]] emirs agree with the Hausas to be the leader, while the Nupe to be the religion leader as chief imam of Lokoja. Lokoja was ruled by the following Maigari of Lokoja (Hamza, Dauda, Musa, Muhammadu Maikarfi, Abigel) that the British installed who claim to be converted to Islam and called Bukar and reside at Yaragi Madabo Junction of Lokoja as the then new Lokoja palace. Later follow the turn of leadership to Alhaji Yahaya Muhammadu Maikarfi, and after his demise Alhaji Kabiru son of Yahaya Muhammadu Maikarfi take on. They were able to sustain themselves by engaging in farming and hunting activities at Agbaja hill. Even the Patti word is a Nupe word meaning hill, [[Mount Patti]] hill and other surrounding hills are hunting areas of the Lokoja people, at Mount Patti there is aged three that most of the former hunters write their name in [[Ajami]] and the [[Latin script]], that will make you observe that there is no settlement at Mount Patti.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This was the status quo until the Europeans arrived. When Dr [[William Balfour Baikie]] arrived at Lokoja first in 1854 and later in 1857, through his efforts and encouragements, the people descended from Lokoja. He did this through Muhammadu Maikarfi, then the Maigari of Lokoja, in which after he demise the white men use their power and give it to their servant by the Abigel Which was converted to Islam and name him as Bukar, mean Abubakar in Kanuri tun.\n\nThe Bassa-Nges believe that they settled at the foot of [[Mount Patti]] when they came into Lokoja before later moving again and migrating to settle across the Benue just to the north of the Igalas. Whatever the case may be, it is difficult to categorically state in what order any or each of these groups came after the [[Oworo people|Oworos]] to settle in Lokoja town. These different groups lived in different quarters of the town but were closely related socio-politically. They interacted freely and tolerated one another. Present day Lokoja is ruled by the ''Maigari'' (chief) of Lokoja, and his 12 ''Hakimi'' (Sub chiefs) It is important to note however, that each group have their own local criteria: for example, the Maigari has no jurisdiction over the Olu of Oworo, but he does have authority over Ganaja, Kwakware, Sarkin Numa, Adankolo, ward A to ward E and other villages of the Lokoja Holland that is the Salkawa people.\n[[File:Lokoja-1911.jpg|thumb|Lokoja town in 1911]]\nThe present modern settlement at Lokoja was established in 1857 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] explorer [[William Balfour Baikie|William Baikie]] at the site of an earlier model farm constructed during the failed [[Niger expedition of 1841]]. Lokoja was the capital of the British [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] and the chief of Lokoja as at that time is Alhaji Muhammadu Maikarfi. Lokoja remained a convenient administrative town for the British colonial government after the [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of Northern and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Nigeria.htm#Northern%20Nigeria | title = WorldStatesmen.org | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref> The first [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor-General]], Sir [[Frederick Lugard]], governed the new nation of Nigeria from Lokoja. Other subsequent settlers into the city include the Yoruba (mainstream), the Igala, the [[Ebira people|Igbira]] (Igbira Tao and Igbira Koto), and the Bassa-Nge people. However, there are other groups apart from the ones mentioned above but they are classified as temporary visitors and non indigenous. These include the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Bini people|Edo]], etc.\n\nThe city's population has since grown to an estimated count of over 90,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://um.ase.ro/No13/10.pdf|title=No13.(PDF)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is a trade center with respect to its agricultural products; this is because it is situated at the confluence of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] rivers, and is close to the new federal capital of Nigeria in [[Abuja]].

It is about 165&nbsp;km Southwest of Abuja as the crow flies, and 390&nbsp;km Northeast of Lagos by same measure. Residential districts are of varying density, and the city has various suburbs such as Felele, Adankolo, Otokiti and Ganaja. The town is situated in the tropical Wet and Dry savanna climate zone of Nigeria, and temperature remains hot all year round.\n\n==Religion and culture==\nGiven the multiethnic nature of the town, there are various festivals, events and socio-cultural activities depending on the people group. Thus, no particular group's festivals or their socio-cultural activities can be said to be the most prominent. For instance, the Agbo masquerade festival is celebrated by the Oworo people between the months of March and April every year. Other Okuns also celebrate the [[Oro Festival|Oro]] / [[Egungun]] festival while generally, the fishermen in Lokoja celebrate the Donkwo fishing festival and this also comes up in March/April. It is also worthy to mention that editions of Lokoja boat regatta are held, albeit not regularly.\nReligiously, Islam, Christianity and traditional religion exist in Lokoja .The Muslims go to their Mosques for their worship while the Christians do the same in their various churches. Religious festivals include the Muslim Eids and the Christian Christmas and Easter.\n\n==Markets==\n[[File:Morning sojourn at the market place.jpg|thumb|Market place in Lokoja]]\nLokoja has three major markets: New Market (International Market); Old Market; and Kpata Market.

It lies at the confluence of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] [[list of rivers of Nigeria|rivers]] and is the capital of [[Kogi State]].<ref name=britannica>{{cite web | title = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9048796 | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref> While the [[Oworo people|Oworo]], Bassa kwomu [[Bassa Nge]], [[Igala people|Igala]] and [[Ebira people|Ebira]] are indigenous to the area, other [[ethnic groups of Nigeria]], including the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Bini people|Bini/Edo]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], and [[Nupe people|Nupe]], have recently established themselves.\n\n==Etymology==\nDifferent ethnic groups lay claim to having named the city.\n\n* The [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Oworo people|Oworo]] people believe the name comes from ''Ilu Oke Oja'' (\"The settlement located on the hill did not fall\").\n* The [[Hausa people|Hausa]] believe the name comes from ''Loko Ja'' (\"A red corner\") and that the city was named by the emir of [[Zazzau]].\n* The [[Nupe people|Nupe]] believe the name comes from ''Patti Lukongi'' (\"The hill of doves\").\n* The [[Igala people|Igala]] believe the name comes from the expression ''Lewa ka je Eja'' (Come, let's eat fish).\n\n==History==\nThe area that would become Lokoja has been inhabited for thousands of years by people from different ethnic groups prior to the arrival of Europeans. The migrations of these groups to the area could be in part accounted for by its nearness to the banks of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] rivers. Some of the first groups of people to settle in Lokoja were the (Oworo people/yoruba from Ile-Ife), [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Nupe people|Nupe]]. It is said that they migrated from Baro and some parts of present-day [[Niger state]] to the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers. This area eventually became a center of trade.\n\nThe Nupe and [[Zazzau]] emirs agree with the Hausas to be the leader, while the Nupe to be the religion leader as chief imam of Lokoja. Lokoja was ruled by the following Maigari of Lokoja (Hamza, Dauda, Musa, Muhammadu Maikarfi, Abigel) that the British installed who claim to be converted to Islam and called Bukar and reside at Yaragi Madabo Junction of Lokoja as the then new Lokoja palace. Later follow the turn of leadership to Alhaji Yahaya Muhammadu Maikarfi, and after his demise Alhaji Kabiru son of Yahaya Muhammadu Maikarfi take on. They were able to sustain themselves by engaging in farming and hunting activities at Agbaja hill. Even the Patti word is a Nupe word meaning hill, [[Mount Patti]] hill and other surrounding hills are hunting areas of the Lokoja people, at Mount Patti there is aged three that most of the former hunters write their name in [[Ajami]] and the [[Latin script]], that will make you observe that there is no settlement at Mount Patti.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This was the status quo until the Europeans arrived. When Dr [[William Balfour Baikie]] arrived at Lokoja first in 1854 and later in 1857, through his efforts and encouragements, the people descended from Lokoja. He did this through Muhammadu Maikarfi, then the Maigari of Lokoja, in which after he demise the white men use their power and give it to their servant by the Abigel Which was converted to Islam and name him as Bukar, mean Abubakar in Kanuri tun.\n\nThe Bassa-Nges believe that they settled at the foot of [[Mount Patti]] when they came into Lokoja before later moving again and migrating to settle across the Benue just to the north of the Igalas. Whatever the case may be, it is difficult to categorically state in what order any or each of these groups came after the [[Oworo people|Oworos]] to settle in Lokoja town. These different groups lived in different quarters of the town but were closely related socio-politically. They interacted freely and tolerated one another. Present day Lokoja is ruled by the ''Maigari'' (chief) of Lokoja, and his 12 ''Hakimi'' (Sub chiefs) It is important to note however, that each group have their own local criteria: for example, the Maigari has no jurisdiction over the Olu of Oworo, but he does have authority over Ganaja, Kwakware, Sarkin Numa, Adankolo, ward A to ward E and other villages of the Lokoja Holland that is the Salkawa people.\n[[File:Lokoja-1911.jpg|thumb|Lokoja town in 1911]]\nThe present modern settlement at Lokoja was established in 1857 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] explorer [[William Balfour Baikie|William Baikie]] at the site of an earlier model farm constructed during the failed [[Niger expedition of 1841]]. Lokoja was the capital of the British [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] and the chief of Lokoja as at that time is Alhaji Muhammadu Maikarfi. Lokoja remained a convenient administrative town for the British colonial government after the [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]] of Northern and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]] in 1914.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Nigeria.htm#Northern%20Nigeria | title = WorldStatesmen.org | accessdate = 2007-04-06}}</ref> The first [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor-General]], Sir [[Frederick Lugard]], governed the new nation of Nigeria from Lokoja. Other subsequent settlers into the city include the Yoruba (mainstream), the Igala, the [[Ebira people|Igbira]] (Igbira Tao and Igbira Koto), and the Bassa-Nge people. However, there are other groups apart from the ones mentioned above but they are classified as temporary visitors and non indigenous. These include the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Tiv people|Tiv]], [[Bini people|Edo]], etc.\n\nThe city's population has since grown to an estimated count of over 90,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://um.ase.ro/No13/10.pdf|title=No13.(PDF)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is a trade center with respect to its agricultural products; this is because it is situated at the confluence of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] rivers, and is close to the new federal capital of Nigeria in [[Abuja]].
