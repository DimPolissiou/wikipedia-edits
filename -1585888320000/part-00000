His career spanned seven decades.\n\nThe press referred to Loewy as ''The Man Who Shaped America'', ''The Father of Streamlining'' and ''The Father of Industrial Design''.<ref name=\"FastFacts\">[http://www.raymondloewy.com/about.html#fastFacts \"FastFacts\"] on Raymondloewy.com</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLoewy was born in Paris in 1893, the son of Maximilian Loewy, a Jewish journalist from Austria, and a French mother, Marie Labalme. Loewy distinguished himself early with the design of a successful [[model aircraft]], which won the [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.|Gordon Bennett]] [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Cup]] for model airplanes in 1908.<ref>{{cite book |title=Never Leave Well Enough Alone |author=Loewy, Raymond |page=28 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8018-7211-2}}</ref> By the following year, he had commercial sales of the plane, named the ''Ayrel''.\n\nLoewy served in the French army during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), attaining the rank of captain. He was wounded in combat and received the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de guerre]]. After the war he moved to New York, where he arrived in September 1919.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n===Early work===\nIn Loewy's early years in the United States, he lived in New York and found work as a [[window dresser|window designer]] for [[department store]]s, including [[Macy's]], [[Wanamaker's]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks]] in addition to working as a fashion illustrator for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. In 1929 he received his first industrial-design commission to contemporize the appearance of a [[duplicating machines|duplicating machine]] by [[Gestetner]]. Further commissions followed, including work for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], the [[Hupmobile|Hupp Motor Company]] (the [[Hupmobile]] styling), and styling the Coldspot refrigerator<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/coldspot.htm Coldspot Refrigerator]</ref> for [[Sears|Sears-Roebuck]]. It was this product that established his reputation as an industrial designer. He opened a London office in the mid-1930s that continues to operate.<ref>[http://www.loewygroup.com Loewy Group marketing agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124172531/http://www.loewygroup.com/ |date=2007-11-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Pennsylvania Railroad===\nIn 1937, Loewy established a relationship with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and his most notable designs for the firm involved some of their passenger [[locomotive]]s. He designed a streamlined shroud for [[PRR K4s|K4s]] Pacific #3768 to haul the newly redesigned 1938 [[Broadway Limited]]. He followed by styling the experimental [[PRR S1|S1]] locomotive, as well as the [[PRR T1|T1]] class. In 1940, he designed a simplified version of the streamlined shroud for another four [[PRR K4s|K4s]]. In 1942, he designed the streamlined shroud for the experimental duplex engine [[PRR Q1|Q1]] which was his last work of streamlining PRR's steam engine.\n\nIn 1946, at the Pennsylvania Railroad's request, he restyled [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]]'s [[diesel locomotive|diesel]]s with a distinctive \"[[sharknose]]\" reminiscent of the T1. He also designed the experimental steam turbine engine V1 \"Triplex\" for PRR which was never built. While he did not design the famous [[PRR GG1|GG1]] [[electric locomotive]], he improved its appearance with welded rather than riveted construction, and he added a pinstripe paint scheme to highlight its smooth contours.\n\nIn addition to locomotive design, Loewy's studios provided many designs for the Pennsylvania Railroad, including stations, passenger-car interiors, and advertising materials. By 1949, Loewy employed 143 designers, architects, and draftsmen. His business partners were A. Baker Barnhart, William Snaith, and John Breen.<ref name=\"Up from the Egg\">Staff (October 31, 1949) [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801030,00.html \"Up from the Egg\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n===Studebaker===\n[[File:Studebakerlogo1940s.png|thumb|187px|Raymond Loewy's 1930s era [[Studebaker]] logo]]\n[[File:Ambigram New Man logo metal button on a shirt animated gif.gif|thumb|187px|Raymond Loewy's [[ambigram]] logo ''New Man'']]\nLoewy had a long and fruitful relationship with American car maker [[Studebaker]]. Studebaker first retained Loewy and Associates and [[Helen Dryden]] as design consultants in 1936<ref name=hendrym>{{cite book|title=Studebaker: One can do a lot of remembering in South Bend|last=Hendry|first=Maurice M|publisher=[[Automobile Quarterly]]|location=[[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]|pages=228\u2013275|id=Vol X, 3rd Q, 1972}}</ref>{{rp|[p.247]}} and in 1939 Loewy began work with the principal designer [[Virgil Exner]].<ref name=hendrym/><ref>Setright, L.J.K., \"Loewy: When styling became industrial design\", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p. 1211.</ref> Their designs first began appearing with the late-1930s Studebakers. Loewy also designed a new logo to replace the \"turning wheel\" that had been the Studebaker trademark since 1912.<ref name=hendrym />\n\nDuring World War II, American government restrictions on in-house design departments at [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], and [[Chrysler]] prevented official work on civilian automobiles. Because Loewy's firm was independent of the fourth-largest automobile producer in America, no such restrictions applied. This permitted Studebaker to launch the first all-new postwar automobile in 1947, two years ahead of the \"Big Three.\" His team developed an advanced design featuring flush-front fenders and clean rearward lines. The Loewy staff, headed by Exner, also created the [[Studebaker Starlight|Starlight]] body, which featured a rear-window system that wrapped 180\u00b0 around the rear seat.\n\nIn addition to the iconic bullet-nosed Studebakers of 1950 and 1951, the team created the 1953 Studebaker line, highlighted by the Starliner and Starlight coupes. (Publicly credited to Loewy, they were actually the work of Robert Bourke.<ref>Automotive Design Oral History \u2013 [http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Design/Bourke_interview.htm \"Reminiscences of Robert E. Bourke\"]</ref>)\n\nThe Starlight has consistently ranked as one of the best-designed cars of the 1950s in lists compiled since by ''Collectible Automobile'', ''[[Car and Driver]]'', and ''[[Motor Trend]]''. The '53 Starliner, recognized today as \"one of the most beautiful cars ever made\",<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, p.2227\">Ludvigsen, p. 2227{{nonspecific|date=March 2017}}</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2017}} was radical in appearance, as radical in its way as the 1934 [[Chrysler Airflow|Airflow]]. However, it was beset by production problems.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, p.2227\" />\n\nTo brand the new line, Loewy also contemporized Studebaker's logo again by applying the \"Lazy S\" element. His final commission of the 1950s for Studebaker was the transformation of the Starlight and Starliner coupes into the [[Studebaker Silver Hawk|Hawk]] series for the 1956 model year. The photo to the right actually shows a Starliner hardtop, which does not have the \"C\" pillar.\n\nIn the spring of 1961, Studebaker's new president, [[Sherwood Egbert]], recalled Loewy to design the [[Studebaker Avanti|Avanti]]. Egbert hired him to help energize Studebaker's soon-to-be-released line of 1963 passenger cars to attract younger buyers.\n\nDespite the short 40-day schedule allowed to produce a finished design and scale model, Loewy agreed to take the job. He recruited a team consisting of experienced designers, including former Loewy employees John Ebstein; Bob Andrews; and Tom Kellogg, a young student from the [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena. The team worked in a house leased for the purpose in [[Palm Springs, California]]. (Loewy also had a home in Palm Springs that he designed himself.<ref>\nBloch, John, director and producer: [[Martin Agronsky|Agronsky, Martin]], host, (February 23, 1958). \"Look Here. Raymond Loewy\". ''NBC Television Presents'', {{LCCN|96507681}}</ref>) Each team member had a role. Andrews and Kellogg handled sketching, Ebstein oversaw the project, and Loewy was the creative director and offered advice.\n\n===NASA===\nRaymond Loewy worked for [[NASA]] from 1967 to 1973<ref name=paleo>Novak, Matt (October 13, 2014) [http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/raymond-loewys-nasa-designs-are-the-space-future-that-n-1645668220 \"Raymond Loewy's NASA Designs Are The Space Future That Never Was\"] ''Paleofuture''</ref> as a Habitability Consultant for  design of the [[Skylab]] space station, launched in 1973.<ref>Torchinsky, Jason (May 13, 2014) [http://jalopnik.com/why-skylab-was-americas-first-and-best-home-in-space-505269461 \"Why Skylab Was America's First And Best Home In Space\"] ''Jalopnik''</ref> One of NASA's goals in hiring him was to improve the psychology, safety, and comfort of manned spacecraft.<ref name=paleo /> Due to long duration confinement in limited interior space in micro-g with almost non-existing variability in environment, the comfort and well-being of the crew through the use of esthetics played high importance. Loewy suggested a number of improvements to the layout, such as the implementation of a wardroom, where the crew could eat and work together, the wardroom window, the dining table and the color design, among others. A key feature of Raymond Loewy's design for the sleep compartments was that the floor plan for each of the three was different to create a sense of individual identity for each compartment. Elements of the crew quarters included sleep restraints, storage lockers, privacy partitions, lighting, a light baffle, privacy curtains, mirrors, towel holders and a communication box.<ref name=\"Hauplik-Meusburger, Sandra. 2011\">{{Cite book|title=Architecture for astronauts : an activity-based approach|last=Hauplik-Meusburger, Sandra.|date=2011|publisher=SpringerWienNewYork|isbn=9783709106679|location=Vienna|oclc=759926461}}</ref> The table was designed by Loewy in order to avoid creating hierarchical positions for crew members during long missions.

In 1935 it engaged Loewy to overhaul the product line, from the company's logo to operator ergonomics. The first new machine to reflect Loewy's design aesthetic, a crawler tractor known as the International TD-18,<ref>https://contractormag.co.nz/classic-machines/td-18/</ref> was launched in 1938.<ref name=\"books.google.co.nz\"/>\n\n===Allis-Chalmers===\nRaymond Loewy's designers influenced the design of [[Allis-Chalmers]] crawler tractors .<ref name=\"contractormag.co.nz\"/> The tractors were described as having stylish panelwork with curvaceous lines.<ref name=\"contractormag.co.nz\"/>\n\n==Personal life, death and legacy==\nLoewy retired at the age of 87 in 1980 and returned to his native France.\n\nLoewy died in his Monte Carlo residence in 1986.

He was survived by his wife Viola, and their daughter Laurence.\n\n===Foundation===\nIn 1992 Viola and Laurence Loewy, with the support of [[British American Tobacco]], established the Raymond Loewy Foundation in Hamburg, Germany. The foundation was established to promote the discipline of industrial design internationally and preserve the memory of Raymond Loewy. An annual award of \u20ac50,000 is granted to outstanding designers in recognition of their lifetime achievements. Notable grantees include Karl Lagerfeld, [[Philippe Starck]] and [[Dieter Rams]].\n\n===Design philosophy===\nIn 1998 Loewy's daughter, Laurence, established Loewy Design in Atlanta, Georgia, to manage her father's continued interests in the United States.

His career spanned seven decades.\n\nThe press referred to Loewy as ''The Man Who Shaped America'', ''The Father of Streamlining'' and ''The Father of Industrial Design''.<ref name=\"FastFacts\">[http://www.raymondloewy.com/about.html#fastFacts \"FastFacts\"] on Raymondloewy.com</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nLoewy was born in Paris in 1893, the son of Maximilian Loewy, a Jewish journalist from Austria, and a French mother, Marie Labalme. Loewy distinguished himself early with the design of a successful [[model aircraft]], which won the [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.|Gordon Bennett]] [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Cup]] for model airplanes in 1908.<ref>{{cite book |title=Never Leave Well Enough Alone |author=Loewy, Raymond |page=28 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8018-7211-2}}</ref> By the following year, he had commercial sales of the plane, named the ''Ayrel''.\n\nLoewy served in the French army during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), attaining the rank of captain. He was wounded in combat and received the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de guerre]]. After the war he moved to New York, where he arrived in September 1919.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Career==\n===Early work===\nIn Loewy's early years in the United States, he lived in New York and found work as a [[window dresser|window designer]] for [[department store]]s, including [[Macy's]], [[Wanamaker's]] and [[Saks Fifth Avenue|Saks]] in addition to working as a fashion illustrator for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. In 1929 he received his first industrial-design commission to contemporize the appearance of a [[duplicating machines|duplicating machine]] by [[Gestetner]]. Further commissions followed, including work for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], the [[Hupmobile|Hupp Motor Company]] (the [[Hupmobile]] styling), and styling the Coldspot refrigerator<ref>[http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/coldspot.htm Coldspot Refrigerator]</ref> for [[Sears|Sears-Roebuck]]. It was this product that established his reputation as an industrial designer. He opened a London office in the mid-1930s that continues to operate.<ref>[http://www.loewygroup.com Loewy Group marketing agency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124172531/http://www.loewygroup.com/ |date=2007-11-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Pennsylvania Railroad===\nIn 1937, Loewy established a relationship with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and his most notable designs for the firm involved some of their passenger [[locomotive]]s. He designed a streamlined shroud for [[PRR K4s|K4s]] Pacific #3768 to haul the newly redesigned 1938 [[Broadway Limited]]. He followed by styling the experimental [[PRR S1|S1]] locomotive, as well as the [[PRR T1|T1]] class. In 1940, he designed a simplified version of the streamlined shroud for another four [[PRR K4s|K4s]]. In 1942, he designed the streamlined shroud for the experimental duplex engine [[PRR Q1|Q1]] which was his last work of streamlining PRR's steam engine.\n\nIn 1946, at the Pennsylvania Railroad's request, he restyled [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]]'s [[diesel locomotive|diesel]]s with a distinctive \"[[sharknose]]\" reminiscent of the T1. He also designed the experimental steam turbine engine V1 \"Triplex\" for PRR which was never built. While he did not design the famous [[PRR GG1|GG1]] [[electric locomotive]], he improved its appearance with welded rather than riveted construction, and he added a pinstripe paint scheme to highlight its smooth contours.\n\nIn addition to locomotive design, Loewy's studios provided many designs for the Pennsylvania Railroad, including stations, passenger-car interiors, and advertising materials. By 1949, Loewy employed 143 designers, architects, and draftsmen. His business partners were A. Baker Barnhart, William Snaith, and John Breen.<ref name=\"Up from the Egg\">Staff (October 31, 1949) [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801030,00.html \"Up from the Egg\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''</ref>\n\n===Studebaker===\n[[File:Studebakerlogo1940s.png|thumb|187px|Raymond Loewy's 1930s era [[Studebaker]] logo]]\n[[File:Ambigram New Man logo metal button on a shirt animated gif.gif|thumb|187px|Raymond Loewy's [[ambigram]] logo ''New Man'']]\nLoewy had a long and fruitful relationship with American car maker [[Studebaker]]. Studebaker first retained Loewy and Associates and [[Helen Dryden]] as design consultants in 1936<ref name=hendrym>{{cite book|title=Studebaker: One can do a lot of remembering in South Bend|last=Hendry|first=Maurice M|publisher=[[Automobile Quarterly]]|location=[[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]|pages=228\u2013275|id=Vol X, 3rd Q, 1972}}</ref>{{rp|[p.247]}} and in 1939 Loewy began work with the principal designer [[Virgil Exner]].<ref name=hendrym/><ref>Setright, L.J.K., \"Loewy: When styling became industrial design\", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p. 1211.</ref> Their designs first began appearing with the late-1930s Studebakers. Loewy also designed a new logo to replace the \"turning wheel\" that had been the Studebaker trademark since 1912.<ref name=hendrym />\n\nDuring World War II, American government restrictions on in-house design departments at [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], and [[Chrysler]] prevented official work on civilian automobiles. Because Loewy's firm was independent of the fourth-largest automobile producer in America, no such restrictions applied. This permitted Studebaker to launch the first all-new postwar automobile in 1947, two years ahead of the \"Big Three.\" His team developed an advanced design featuring flush-front fenders and clean rearward lines. The Loewy staff, headed by Exner, also created the [[Studebaker Starlight|Starlight]] body, which featured a rear-window system that wrapped 180\u00b0 around the rear seat.\n\nIn addition to the iconic bullet-nosed Studebakers of 1950 and 1951, the team created the 1953 Studebaker line, highlighted by the Starliner and Starlight coupes. (Publicly credited to Loewy, they were actually the work of Robert Bourke.<ref>Automotive Design Oral History \u2013 [http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Design/Bourke_interview.htm \"Reminiscences of Robert E. Bourke\"]</ref>)\n\nThe Starlight has consistently ranked as one of the best-designed cars of the 1950s in lists compiled since by ''Collectible Automobile'', ''[[Car and Driver]]'', and ''[[Motor Trend]]''. The '53 Starliner, recognized today as \"one of the most beautiful cars ever made\",<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, p.2227\">Ludvigsen, p. 2227{{nonspecific|date=March 2017}}</ref>{{nonspecific|date=March 2017}} was radical in appearance, as radical in its way as the 1934 [[Chrysler Airflow|Airflow]]. However, it was beset by production problems.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, p.2227\" />\n\nTo brand the new line, Loewy also contemporized Studebaker's logo again by applying the \"Lazy S\" element. His final commission of the 1950s for Studebaker was the transformation of the Starlight and Starliner coupes into the [[Studebaker Silver Hawk|Hawk]] series for the 1956 model year. The photo to the right actually shows a Starliner hardtop, which does not have the \"C\" pillar.\n\nIn the spring of 1961, Studebaker's new president, [[Sherwood Egbert]], recalled Loewy to design the [[Studebaker Avanti|Avanti]]. Egbert hired him to help energize Studebaker's soon-to-be-released line of 1963 passenger cars to attract younger buyers.\n\nDespite the short 40-day schedule allowed to produce a finished design and scale model, Loewy agreed to take the job. He recruited a team consisting of experienced designers, including former Loewy employees John Ebstein; Bob Andrews; and Tom Kellogg, a young student from the [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena. The team worked in a house leased for the purpose in [[Palm Springs, California]]. (Loewy also had a home in Palm Springs that he designed himself.<ref>\nBloch, John, director and producer: [[Martin Agronsky|Agronsky, Martin]], host, (February 23, 1958). \"Look Here. Raymond Loewy\". ''NBC Television Presents'', {{LCCN|96507681}}</ref>) Each team member had a role. Andrews and Kellogg handled sketching, Ebstein oversaw the project, and Loewy was the creative director and offered advice.\n\n===NASA===\nRaymond Loewy worked for [[NASA]] from 1967 to 1973<ref name=paleo>Novak, Matt (October 13, 2014) [http://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/raymond-loewys-nasa-designs-are-the-space-future-that-n-1645668220 \"Raymond Loewy's NASA Designs Are The Space Future That Never Was\"] ''Paleofuture''</ref> as a Habitability Consultant for  design of the [[Skylab]] space station, launched in 1973.<ref>Torchinsky, Jason (May 13, 2014) [http://jalopnik.com/why-skylab-was-americas-first-and-best-home-in-space-505269461 \"Why Skylab Was America's First And Best Home In Space\"] ''Jalopnik''</ref> One of NASA's goals in hiring him was to improve the psychology, safety, and comfort of manned spacecraft.<ref name=paleo /> Loewy suggested a number of improvements to the layout, such as the implementation of a wardroom, where the crew could eat and work together, the wardroom window, the dining table and the color design, among others. A key feature of Raymond Loewy's design for the sleep compartments was that the floor plan for each of the three was different to create a sense of individual identity for each compartment. Elements of the crew quarters included sleep restraints, storage lockers, privacy partitions, lighting, a light baffle, privacy curtains, mirrors, towel holders and a communication box.<ref name=\"Hauplik-Meusburger, Sandra. 2011\">{{Cite book|title=Architecture for astronauts : an activity-based approach|last=Hauplik-Meusburger, Sandra.|date=2011|publisher=SpringerWienNewYork|isbn=9783709106679|location=Vienna|oclc=759926461}}</ref> The table was designed by Loewy in order to avoid creating hierarchical positions for crew members during long missions.

In 1935 it engaged Loewy to overhaul the product line, from the company's logo to operator ergonomics. The first new machine to reflect Loewy's design aesthetic, a crawler tractor known as the International TD-18,<ref>https://contractormag.co.nz/classic-machines/td-18/</ref> was launched in 1938.<ref name=\"books.google.co.nz\"/>\n\n===Allis-Chalmers===\nRaymond Loewy's designers influenced the design of [[Allis-Chalmers]] crawler tractors .<ref name=\"contractormag.co.nz\"/> The tractors were described as having stylish panelwork with curvaceous lines.<ref name=\"contractormag.co.nz\"/>\n\n==Personal life, death and legacy==\nLoewy retired at the age of 87 in 1980 and returned to his native France.\n\nLoewy died in his Monte Carlo residence in 1986.

The foundation was established to promote the discipline of industrial design internationally and preserve the memory of Raymond Loewy. An annual award of \u20ac50,000 is granted to outstanding designers in recognition of their lifetime achievements. Notable grantees include Karl Lagerfeld, [[Philippe Starck]] and [[Dieter Rams]].\n\n===Design philosophy===\nIn 1998 Loewy's daughter, Laurence, established Loewy Design in Atlanta, Georgia, to manage her father's continued interests in the United States.

It was released on December 2, 2000 by [[Epic Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album. The song was written by [[Damon Sharpe]], [[Greg Lawson (musician)|Greg Lawson]], Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Monroe and Amille D. Harris, and produced by [[Ric Wake]], Richie Jones and [[Cory Rooney]]. At the time of the song's release, Lopez was transitioning into a [[sex symbol]] and in a relationship with American rapper [[Sean Combs]]. Lyrically, \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" is described as an \"exploration of love\" in which Lopez is unhappy about her materialistic lover; provoking much media analysis as to whether or not it was an innuendo towards Combs. Ultimately, the pair's courtship ended shortly after its release. Described as \"frothy\" and \"catchy\" by critics, it was noted for its message about love and commercial appeal to women.\n\n\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was met with worldwide commercial success and is considered \"classic Lopez\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Jennifer Lopez Is 'The Boss,' Boyfriend Says|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1689873/jennifer-lopez-boyfriend-casper-smart.jhtml|publisher=MTV News.

The music video for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]] and choreographed by [[Darrin Dewitt Henson]] was met with acclaim, garnering [[MTV Video Music Award]] and [[ALMA Award]] nominations. It became one of the year's most-viewed clips, and was highly requested on the music video broadcasting series, ''[[Total Request Live]]''. The music video subsequently became notorious after Lopez married [[Cris Judd]], one of the back-up dancers who appeared in it. Lopez has performed \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" live on numerous occasions, including the [[2000 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York City, held days before [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\n==Background and release==\nAfter a high-profile title role in the musical biopic ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' (1997), Lopez began developing her own career in music, later being signed to [[Work Records]] by [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref>Mendible, M.

He recalled: \"I wrote and recorded a track which eventually turned out to be 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'. I called Damon up, and I played the track and sang the melody to him over the phone. We ended up collaborating on the song, with both of us writing parts of the melody and the lyric. I came up with the title, and he came up with the key line, 'Even if you were broke,' in the chorus. Three other writers, Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Munroe and Amil Harris, also contributed parts to the song.\" In August, after a demo for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" had been recorded, Sharpe sent a CD of the song to Wake at his studio in New York. Wake, who loved the song, played it for Lopez, who also loved it. Not soon after, the master recording of \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was cut at Sony Studios in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/greglawson.html |title=Greg Lawson - Writing Love Don't Cost A Thing For J-Lo |publisher=Songwriteruniverse.com |date=1999-12-31 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Composition and lyrical interpretation==\n{{Listen\n| pos = left\n| filename = Love Don't Cost a Thing.ogg\n| title = \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\"\n| description = A 24-second sample of \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\"\n}}\n\n\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" is a [[pop music|pop]]<ref name=\"EW\" /> and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/jennifer-lopez-j-lo |title=Jennifer Lopez: J.

It was released on December 2, 2000 by [[Epic Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album. The song was written by [[Damon Sharpe]], [[Greg Lawson]], Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Monroe and Amille D. Harris, and produced by [[Ric Wake]], Richie Jones and [[Cory Rooney]]. At the time of the song's release, Lopez was transitioning into a [[sex symbol]] and in a relationship with American rapper [[Sean Combs]]. Lyrically, \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" is described as an \"exploration of love\" in which Lopez is unhappy about her materialistic lover; provoking much media analysis as to whether or not it was an innuendo towards Combs. Ultimately, the pair's courtship ended shortly after its release. Described as \"frothy\" and \"catchy\" by critics, it was noted for its message about love and commercial appeal to women.\n\n\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" was met with worldwide commercial success and is considered \"classic Lopez\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Jennifer Lopez Is 'The Boss,' Boyfriend Says|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1689873/jennifer-lopez-boyfriend-casper-smart.jhtml|publisher=MTV News.

The music video for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]] and choreographed by [[Darrin Dewitt Henson]] was met with acclaim, garnering [[MTV Video Music Award]] and [[ALMA Award]] nominations. It became one of the year's most-viewed clips, and was highly requested on the music video broadcasting series, ''[[Total Request Live]]''. The music video subsequently became notorious after Lopez married [[Cris Judd]], one of the back-up dancers who appeared in it. Lopez has performed \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" live on numerous occasions, including the [[2000 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York City, held days before [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\n==Background and release==\nAfter a high-profile title role in the musical biopic ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' (1997), Lopez began developing her own career in music, later being signed to [[Work Records]] by [[Tommy Mottola]].<ref>Mendible, M.

He recalled: \"I wrote and recorded a track which eventually turned out to be 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'. I called Damon up, and I played the track and sang the melody to him over the phone. We ended up collaborating on the song, with both of us writing parts of the melody and the lyric. I came up with the title, and he came up with the key line, 'Even if you were broke,' in the chorus. Three other writers, Georgette Franklin, Jeremy Munroe and Amil Harris, also contributed parts to the song.\" In August, after a demo for \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" had been recorded, Sharpe sent a CD of the song to Wake at his studio in New York. Wake, who loved the song, played it for Lopez, who also loved it.
