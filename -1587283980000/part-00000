Non-shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences that differ between twins in the same family) explain most of the variance in key components of the condition such as the fear of illness and disease conviction. In contrast, the contribution of shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences shared by twins in the same family) to hypochondriasis is approximately zero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough little is known about exactly which non-shared environmental factors typically contribute to causing hypochondriasis, certain factors such as exposure to illness-related information are widely believed to lead to short-term increases in health anxiety and to have contributed to hypochondriasis in individual cases. Overly protective caregivers and an excessive focus on minor health concerns have also been implicated as potential causes of hypochondriasis.<ref>\"Hypochondriasis.\" CareNotes. Thomson Healthcare, Inc., 2011. Health Reference Center Academic. Retrieved April 5, 2012.{{vs|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the media and on the Internet, articles, TV shows and advertisements regarding serious illnesses such as [[cancer]] and [[multiple sclerosis]] often portray these diseases as being random, obscure and somewhat inevitable. In the short term, inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of [[non-specific symptom]]s as signs of serious illness may contribute to exacerbating a fear of illness. Major disease outbreaks or predicted [[pandemics]] can have similar effects.\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that it is common for serious illnesses or deaths of family members or friends to trigger hypochondria in certain individuals. Similarly, when approaching the age of a parent's premature death from disease, many otherwise healthy, happy individuals fall prey to hypochondria. These individuals believe they are suffering from the same disease that caused their parent's death, sometimes causing panic attacks with corresponding symptoms.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe [[ICD-10]] defines hypochondriasis as follows:\n:A. Either one of the following:\n::* A persistent belief, of at least six months' duration, of the presence of a minimum of two serious physical diseases (of which at least one must be specifically named by the patient).\n::* A persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement ([[body dysmorphic disorder]]).\n\n:B. Preoccupation with the belief and the symptoms causes persistent distress or interference with personal functioning in daily living, and leads the patient to seek medical treatment or investigations (or equivalent help from local healers).\n\n:C. Persistent refusal to accept medical advice that there is no adequate physical cause for the symptoms or physical abnormality, except for short periods of up to a few weeks at a time immediately after or during medical investigations.\n\n:D. Most commonly used exclusion criteria: not occurring only during any of the [[schizophrenia]] and related disorders (F20\u2013F29, particularly F22) or any of the [[mood disorders]] (F30\u2013F39).\n\nThe [[DSM-IV]] defines hypochondriasis according to the following criteria:<ref name=\"American Psychiatric Association\" />\n<blockquote>\nA. Preoccupation with fears of having, or the idea that one has, a serious disease based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. <br />\nB. The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. <br />\nC. The belief in Criterion A is not of delusional intensity (as in [[Delusional Disorder]], Somatic Type) and is not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance (as in [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]]). <br />\nD. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. <br />\nE. The duration of the disturbance is at least 6 months. <br />\nF. The preoccupation is not better accounted for by [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]], [[Panic Disorder]], a [[Major Depressive Episode]], [[Separation anxiety disorder|Separation Anxiety]], or another Somatoform Disorder.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the fifth version of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]), most who met criteria for [[DSM-IV]] hypochondriasis instead meet criteria for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder (IAD).<ref name=\"mayoclinic.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Saddam Hussein in 1996.png|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] was a severe hypochondriac. He would have doctors check him every two or three days and was known react to a small cut or bruise as if he were going to die.]]\n\n===Classification===\nThe classification of hypochondriasis in relation to other psychiatric disorders has long been a topic of scholarly debate, and has differed widely between different diagnostic systems and influential publications.\n\nIn the case of the DSM, the first and second versions listed hypochondriasis as a neurosis, whereas the third and fourth versions listed hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The current version of the DSM (DSM-5) lists somatic symptom disorder (SSD) under the heading of \"somatic symptom and related disorders\", and illness anxiety disorder (IAD) under both this heading and as an anxiety disorder.\n\nThe ICD-10, like the third and fourth versions of the DSM, lists hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The ICD-11, however, lists hypochondriasis under the heading of \"obsessive-compulsive or related disorders\".\n\nThere are also numerous influential scientific publications which have argued for other classifications of hypochondriasis. Notably, since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly common to regard hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder, and to refer to the condition as \"health anxiety\" or \"severe health anxiety\".\n\n==Treatment==\nMost research indicates that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is an effective treatment for hypochondriasis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olatunji BO, Kauffman BY, Meltzer S, Davis ML, Smits JA, Powers MB | title = Cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriasis/health anxiety: a meta-analysis of treatment outcome and moderators | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 65\u201374 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24954212 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2014.05.002 }}</ref><ref name=\"bouman\" /> Much of this research is limited by methodological issues.<ref name=\"bouman\">{{cite journal |last1=Bouman |first1=Theo K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Narrative Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=58\u201369 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119010612}}</ref> A small amount of evidence suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] can also reduce symptoms, but further research is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Louw |first1=Kerry-Ann |last2=Hoare |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=70\u20134 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119004750}}</ref> In some cases, hypochondriasis responds well to [[antipsychotic]]s, particularly the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] medications.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor S, Thordarson DS, Jang KL, Asmundson GJ|year=2006|title=Genetic and environmental origins of health anxiety: a twin study|url=|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47\u201350|doi=|pmid=16757996|pmc=1472263}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Harth |first2=Uwe |last2=Gieler |first3=Daniel |last3=Kusnir |first4=Francisco A. |last4=Tausk | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |chapter=Hypochondriacal Delusions |chapterurl={{google books|NHnEMdgKJbIC|page=36|plainurl=yes}} |page=36 |title=Clinical Management in Psychodermatology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34718-7 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAmong the [[abdomen#Regions|regions of the abdomen]], the [[hypochondrium]] is the uppermost part.

Non-shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences that differ between twins in the same family) explain most of the variance in key components of the condition such as the fear of illness and disease conviction. In contrast, the contribution of shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences shared by twins in the same family) to hypochondriasis is approximately zero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough little is known about exactly which non-shared environmental factors typically contribute to causing hypochondriasis, certain factors such as exposure to illness-related information are widely believed to lead to short-term increases in health anxiety and to have contributed to hypochondriasis in individual cases. Overly protective caregivers and an excessive focus on minor health concerns have also been implicated as potential causes of hypochondriasis.<ref>\"Hypochondriasis.\" CareNotes.

In the short term, inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of [[non-specific symptom]]s as signs of serious illness may contribute to exacerbating a fear of illness. Major disease outbreaks or predicted [[pandemics]] can have similar effects.\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that it is common for serious illnesses or deaths of family members or friends to trigger hypochondria in certain individuals. Similarly, when approaching the age of a parent's premature death from disease, many otherwise healthy, happy individuals fall prey to hypochondria. These individuals believe they are suffering from the same disease that caused their parent's death, sometimes causing panic attacks with corresponding symptoms.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe [[ICD-10]] defines hypochondriasis as follows:\n:A. Either one of the following:\n::* A persistent belief, of at least six months' duration, of the presence of a minimum of two serious physical diseases (of which at least one must be specifically named by the patient).\n::* A persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement ([[body dysmorphic disorder]]).\n\n:B. Preoccupation with the belief and the symptoms causes persistent distress or interference with personal functioning in daily living, and leads the patient to seek medical treatment or investigations (or equivalent help from local healers).\n\n:C. Persistent refusal to accept medical advice that there is no adequate physical cause for the symptoms or physical abnormality, except for short periods of up to a few weeks at a time immediately after or during medical investigations.\n\n:D. Most commonly used exclusion criteria: not occurring only during any of the [[schizophrenia]] and related disorders (F20\u2013F29, particularly F22) or any of the [[mood disorders]] (F30\u2013F39).\n\nThe [[DSM-IV]] defines hypochondriasis according to the following criteria:<ref name=\"American Psychiatric Association\" />\n<blockquote>\nA. Preoccupation with fears of having, or the idea that one has, a serious disease based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. <br />\nB. The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. <br />\nC. The belief in Criterion A is not of delusional intensity (as in [[Delusional Disorder]], Somatic Type) and is not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance (as in [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]]). <br />\nD. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. <br />\nE. The duration of the disturbance is at least 6 months. <br />\nF. The preoccupation is not better accounted for by [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]], [[Panic Disorder]], a [[Major Depressive Episode]], [[Separation anxiety disorder|Separation Anxiety]], or another Somatoform Disorder.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the fifth version of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]), most who met criteria for [[DSM-IV]] hypochondriasis instead meet criteria for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder (IAD).<ref name=\"mayoclinic.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Saddam Hussein in 1996.png|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] was a severe hypochondriac. He would have doctors check him every two or three days and was known react to a small cut or bruise as if he were going to die.]]\n\n===Classification===\nThe classification of hypochondriasis in relation to other psychiatric disorders has long been a topic of scholarly debate, and has differed widely between different diagnostic systems and influential publications.\n\nIn the case of the DSM, the first and second versions listed hypochondriasis as a neurosis, whereas the third and fourth versions listed hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The current version of the DSM (DSM-5) lists somatic symptom disorder (SSD) under the heading of \"somatic symptom and related disorders\", and illness anxiety disorder (IAD) under both this heading and as an anxiety disorder.\n\nThe ICD-10, like the third and fourth versions of the DSM, lists hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The ICD-11, however, lists hypochondriasis under the heading of \"obsessive-compulsive or related disorders\".\n\nThere are also numerous influential scientific publications which have argued for other classifications of hypochondriasis. Notably, since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly common to regard hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder, and to refer to the condition as \"health anxiety\" or \"severe health anxiety\".\n\n==Treatment==\nMost research indicates that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is an effective treatment for hypochondriasis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olatunji BO, Kauffman BY, Meltzer S, Davis ML, Smits JA, Powers MB | title = Cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriasis/health anxiety: a meta-analysis of treatment outcome and moderators | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 65\u201374 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24954212 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2014.05.002 }}</ref><ref name=\"bouman\" /> Much of this research is limited by methodological issues.<ref name=\"bouman\">{{cite journal |last1=Bouman |first1=Theo K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Narrative Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=58\u201369 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119010612}}</ref> A small amount of evidence suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] can also reduce symptoms, but further research is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Louw |first1=Kerry-Ann |last2=Hoare |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=70\u20134 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119004750}}</ref> In some cases, hypochondriasis responds well to [[antipsychotic]]s, particularly the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] medications.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor S, Thordarson DS, Jang KL, Asmundson GJ|year=2006|title=Genetic and environmental origins of health anxiety: a twin study|url=|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47\u201350|doi=|pmid=16757996|pmc=1472263}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Harth |first2=Uwe |last2=Gieler |first3=Daniel |last3=Kusnir |first4=Francisco A. |last4=Tausk | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |chapter=Hypochondriacal Delusions |chapterurl={{google books|NHnEMdgKJbIC|page=36|plainurl=yes}} |page=36 |title=Clinical Management in Psychodermatology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34718-7 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAmong the [[abdomen#Regions|regions of the abdomen]], the [[hypochondrium]] is the uppermost part.
