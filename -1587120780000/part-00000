The [[flower]]s are in dense [[panicle]]s or spikes {{convert|5|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The [[fruit]]s are reddish, thin-fleshed [[drupe]]s covered in varying levels of hairs at maturity and form dense clusters at branch tips, sometimes called sumac bobs.\n\nThe leaves and bark of most sumac species contain high levels of [[tannin]]s and have been used in the manufacturing of leather by many cultures around the world.  The Hebrew name ''og ha-bursaka'im'' means \"tanner's sumac\". The dried fruits of some species are ground to produce a tangy, crimson spice popular in many countries (see [[za'atar]]).<ref name=\"taste\">One may use sumac as a tisane or tea substitute by boiling the dried leaves.[http://www.taste.com.au/how+to/articles/52/sumac Sumac - Ingredients - Taste.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://landscaping.about.com/cs/landscapecolor/a/sumac.htm Poison Sumach and Good Sumac Shrubs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fruits are also used to make a traditional \"[[Lemonade#Pink lemonade|pink lemonade]]\" beverage by steeping them in water before straining to remove hairs which may irritate the mouth or throat, sometimes adding sweeteners such as honey or sugar.

This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth, and sweetening it. Native Americans also use the leaves and drupes of the smooth and staghorn sumacs combined with [[tobacco]] in traditional smoking mixtures.\n\n===Dye and tanning agent===\nThe leaves of certain sumacs yield [[tannin]] (mostly [[pyrogallol-type tannin|pyrogallol]]-type), a substance used in vegetable [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. Notable sources include the leaves of ''R. coriaria'', Chinese gall on ''[[Rhus chinensis|R. chinensis]]'', and wood and roots of ''[[Rhus pentaphylla|R. pentaphylla]]''.

Sumac was especially dangerous to marble: \"When sumac dust settles on white marble, the result is not immediately apparent, but if it once becomes wet, or even damp, it becomes a powerful purple dye, which penetrates the marble to an extraordinary depth.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Marble and marble workers: a handbook for architects, artists, masons and students|last = Lee|first = Arthur|publisher = Crosby Lockwood & Son|year = 1888|isbn = |location = London|pages = 19}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional medicinal use===\nSumac was used as a treatment for several different ailments in medieval medicine, primarily in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries (where sumac was more readily available than in Europe). An 11th-century shipwreck off the coast of [[Rhodes]], excavated by archeologists in the 1970s, contained commercial quantities of sumac [[drupe]]s.

''[[Rhus diversiloba]]''), and [[poison sumac]] (''Toxicodendron vernix'', syn. ''Rhus vernix''), produce the allergen [[urushiol]] and can cause severe allergic reactions. Poison sumac may be identified by its white drupes, which are quite different from the red drupes of true ''Rhus'' species.\n\nMowing of sumac is not a good control measure, since the wood is springy, resulting in jagged, sharp-pointed stumps when mown. The plant will quickly recover with new growth after mowing.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2298&context=extensionhist |first=John |last=Ortmann |author2=Miles, Katherine L. |author3=Stubbendieck, James  H. |author4=Schacht, Walter |title=Management of Smooth Sumac on Grasslands |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |year=1997}}</ref> [[Goats]] have long been considered an efficient and quick removal method, as they eat the bark, which helps prevent new shoots. Sumac propagates by [[rhizome]]. Small shoots will be found growing near a more mature sumac tree via a shallow running root quite some distance from the primary tree. Thus, root pruning is a means of control without eliminating the species altogether.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* RO Moffett.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are usually [[Pinnate|pinnately compound]], though some species have trifoliate or simple leaves. The [[flower]]s are in dense [[panicle]]s or spikes {{convert|5|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, each flower very small, greenish, creamy white or red, with five petals. The [[fruit]]s are reddish, thin-fleshed [[drupe]]s covered in varying levels of hairs at maturity and form dense clusters at branch tips, sometimes called sumac bobs.\n\nThe leaves and bark of most sumac species contain high levels of [[tannin]]s and have been used in the manufacturing of leather by many cultures around the world.  The Hebrew name ''og ha-bursaka'im'' means \"tanner's sumac\". The dried fruits of some species are ground to produce a tangy, crimson spice popular in many countries (see [[za'atar]]).<ref name=\"taste\">One may use sumac as a tisane or tea substitute by boiling the dried leaves.[http://www.taste.com.au/how+to/articles/52/sumac Sumac - Ingredients - Taste.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://landscaping.about.com/cs/landscapecolor/a/sumac.htm Poison Sumach and Good Sumac Shrubs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fruits are also used to make a traditional \"[[Lemonade#Pink lemonade|pink lemonade]]\" beverage by steeping them in water before straining to remove hairs which may irritate the mouth or throat, sometimes adding sweeteners such as honey or sugar. Although widely and erroneously stated to be rich in [[vitamin C]], most Rhus species contain only trace amounts and none should be considered a dietary source of this nutrient. It is high amounts of [[malic acid]] that produce the tart flavor.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46033244_Comparative_Study_on_the_Chemical_Composition_of_Syrian_Sumac_Rhus_coriaria_L_and_Chinese_Sumac_Rhus_typhina_L_Fruits</ref> In [[comparative research]], the fruits of [[Rhus coriaria]] were found to contain the highest levels of ascorbic acid at approximately 39&nbsp;mg/kg, which would require an adult to consume several pounds daily to reach the US daily [[dietary reference intake]] of vitamin C.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK225480/</ref> Sumacs were also cultivated in [[Tannaim|mishnaic]] times and are therefore reckoned with those fruits to which the law of ''pe'ah'' applied ([[Pe'ah]] 1:5), but in Israel, where it grew wild abundantly, it was not very highly valued and a lenient attitude was adopted about ''pe'ah'' (Dem. 1:1).\n\nSumacs propagate both by [[seed]] ([[Zoochorous|spread]] by [[bird]]s and other animals through their [[feces|droppings]]), and by new [[shoot]]s from [[rhizome]]s, forming large [[Clonal colony|clonal colonies]].{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Sumac-Drupes.JPG|thumb|150px|Drupes of a staghorn sumac in Coudersport, Pennsylvania]]\n[[File:Rhus typhina.JPG|thumb|150px|A young branch of staghorn sumac]]\n[[File:Rhus copallinum.jpg|thumb|150px|Winged sumac leaves and flowers]]\n[[File:Rhus sp hybrid SRIC SR 00-05-19.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''[[Rhus]]'' hybrid fossil \u2013 about 49.5 million years old, Early [[Ypresian]], [[Klondike Mountain Formation]],  Washington]]\nThe taxonomy of ''Rhus'' has a long history, with [[de Candolle]] proposing a subgeneric classification in 1825, with five sections.

One classification uses two subgenera, ''Rhus'' (about  10&nbsp;[[spp.]]) and ''Lobadium'' (about 25&nbsp;spp.), while at the same time ''[[Cotinus]]'', ''[[Duckera]]'', ''[[Malosma]]'', ''[[Metopium]]'', ''[[searsia (plant)|Searsia]]'' and ''[[Toxicodendron]]'' segregated to create ''Rhus'' ''s.s.''. Other genera that have been segregated include ''[[Actinocheita]]'' and ''[[Baronia (plant)|Baronia]]''. As defined, ''Rhus'' ''s.s.'' appears [[monophyletic]] by [[molecular phylogeny]] research.

Syria uses the spice also, it is one of the main ingredients of Kubah Sumakieh in Aleppo of Syria, it is added to salads in the [[Levant]], as well as being one of the main ingredients in the Palestinian dish, ''[[musakhan]]''. In [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan]], [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladeshi]], [[Indian cuisine|Indian]], [[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]], [[Mizrahi cuisine|Mizrahi]], and [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistani]] cuisines, sumac is added to rice or ''[[kebab]]''. In [[Azerbaijani cuisine|Azerbaijani]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]], [[Syrian cuisine|Syrian]], [[Jordanian cuisine|Jordanian]], [[Lebanese cuisine|Lebanese]] and [[Turkish cuisine]]s, it is added to salads,  ''kebab'' and ''[[lahmajoun]]''. ''[[Rhus coriaria]]'' is used in the spice mixture ''[[za'atar]]''.<ref>Christine Manfield, Charlie Trotter, Ashley Barber -Spice 2008 - Page 28 \"Sumac This reddish ground spice is made from the berries of the sumac bush,\"</ref><ref>Aliza Green ''Field Guide to Herbs & Spices: How to Identify, Select, and Use ...'' 2006 - Page 257 \"In Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt, sumac is cooked with water to a thick sour paste, which is added to meat and vegetable dishes; this method was also common in Roman times.

This drink is made by soaking the drupes in cool water, rubbing them to extract the essence, straining the liquid through a cotton cloth, and sweetening it. Native Americans also use the leaves and drupes of the smooth and staghorn sumacs combined with [[tobacco]] in traditional smoking mixtures.\n\n===Dye and tanning agent===\nThe leaves of certain sumacs yield [[tannin]] (mostly [[pyrogallol-type tannin|pyrogallol]]-type), a substance used in vegetable [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]]. Notable sources include the leaves of ''R. coriaria'', Chinese gall on ''[[Rhus chinensis|R. chinensis]]'', and wood and roots of ''[[Rhus pentaphylla|R. pentaphylla]]''. [[Leather]] tanned with sumac is flexible, light in weight, and light in color. One type of leather made with sumac tannins is [[morocco leather]].<ref>Davis, Charles T.  The Manufacture of Leather.

Sumac was especially dangerous to marble: \"When sumac dust settles on white marble, the result is not immediately apparent, but if it once becomes wet, or even damp, it becomes a powerful purple dye, which penetrates the marble to an extraordinary depth.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Marble and marble workers: a handbook for architects, artists, masons and students|last = Lee|first = Arthur|publisher = Crosby Lockwood & Son|year = 1888|isbn = |location = London|pages = 19}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional medicinal use===\nSumac was used as a treatment for several different ailments in medieval medicine, primarily in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries (where sumac was more readily available than in Europe). An 11th-century shipwreck off the coast of [[Rhodes]], excavated by archeologists in the 1970s, contained commercial quantities of sumac [[drupe]]s. These could have been intended for use as medicine, as a culinary spice, or as a dye.<ref>{{cite book |author=Bass, George Fletcher |author2=Allan, James W. |title=Ser\u00e7e Liman\u0131: An Eleventh-century Shipwreck |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E6ZJ-05aC-sC&pg=PA506 |year=2003 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |isbn=978-0-89096-947-2 |page=506 }}</ref>\n\n===Other uses===\nSome beekeepers use dried sumac bobs as a source of fuel for their smokers.<ref>Avitabile, Alphonse.

''[[Rhus diversiloba]]''), and [[poison sumac]] (''Toxicodendron vernix'', syn. ''Rhus vernix''), produce the allergen [[urushiol]] and can cause severe allergic reactions. Poison sumac may be identified by its white drupes, which are quite different from the red drupes of true ''Rhus'' species.\n\nMowing of sumac is not a good control measure, since the wood is springy, resulting in jagged, sharp-pointed stumps when mown. The plant will quickly recover with new growth after mowing.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2298&context=extensionhist |first=John |last=Ortmann |author2=Miles, Katherine L. |author3=Stubbendieck, James  H. |author4=Schacht, Walter |title=Management of Smooth Sumac on Grasslands |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |year=1997}}</ref> [[Goats]] have long been considered an efficient and quick removal method, as they eat the bark, which helps prevent new shoots. Sumac propagates by [[rhizome]]. Small shoots will be found growing near a more mature sumac tree via a shallow running root quite some distance from the primary tree. Thus, root pruning is a means of control without eliminating the species altogether.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* RO Moffett.

It was released by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] as the fifth [[Single (music)|single]] from Eilish's debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote \"Bad Guy\", with the latter producing it and the former providing additional production. The song was described as [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]], [[pop-trap]], and [[Goth rock|nu-goth]] [[pop music|pop]] in press reviews, for which [[synth bass]], a [[kick drum]], finger snaps and [[Roland TR-808|808 bass]] provide minimalist instrumentation. During the song's lyrics, Eilish taunts her lover for being a [[wiktionary:bad boy|bad guy]] although suggesting that she is more resilient than he is, and further touches on themes about [[misandry]] and sarcasm.\n\nUpon its release, \"Bad Guy\" received mainly positive reviews. It was also likened to music recorded by [[the White Stripes]], [[Lorde]] and [[Fiona Apple]]. \"Bad Guy\" was a commercial success, reaching number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], as well as on the [[record chart|charts]] in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and Russia. In the United States, \"Bad Guy\" ended the record-breaking 19-week run of \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]. \"Bad Guy\" also peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], among others. It has been awarded several [[Music recording certification|certification]]s, notably an octuple platinum award from the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and a sextuple one from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). \"Bad Guy\" has received several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. \n\n[[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] directed the music video for \"Bad Guy\" which was uploaded onto Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the single's digital release. The video depicts Eilish being involved in several activities, including wild dancing, suffering a nosebleed and sitting on the back of a man doing [[push-up]]s. Reviewers noted the video for its [[camp (style)|camp]] elements and eccentric imagery. For promotional purposes, Eilish performed the song on several occasions and also included it on the set list for her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] (2019) and [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]] (2020). On July 11, 2019, a remix of \"Bad Guy\" featuring Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] was released to mixed reviews from critics, who mostly commented on Bieber's vocals.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.]]\n\n[[Billie Eilish]] released her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' on March 29, 2019, via Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|title=Billie Eilish's Debut LP 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'

It was released by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] as the fifth [[Single (music)|single]] from Eilish's debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' Eilish and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] co-wrote \"Bad Guy\", with the latter producing it and the former providing additional production. The song was described as [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]], [[pop-trap]], and [[Goth rock|nu-goth]] [[pop music|pop]] in press reviews, for which [[synth bass]], a [[kick drum]], finger snaps and [[Roland TR-808|808 bass]] provide minimalist instrumentation. During the song's lyrics, Eilish taunts her lover for being a [[wiktionary:bad boy|bad guy]] although suggesting that she is more resilient than he is, and further touches on themes about [[misandry]] and sarcasm.\n\nUpon its release, \"Bad Guy\" received mainly positive reviews. It was also likened to music recorded by [[the White Stripes]], [[Lorde]] and [[Fiona Apple]]. \"Bad Guy\" was a commercial success, reaching number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], as well as on the [[record chart|charts]] in Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway and Russia. In the United States, \"Bad Guy\" ended the record-breaking 19-week run of \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]. \"Bad Guy\" also peaked at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]], among others. It has been awarded several [[Music recording certification|certification]]s, notably an octuple platinum award from the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and a sextuple one from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). \"Bad Guy\" has received several awards, including [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. \n\n[[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] directed the music video for \"Bad Guy\" which was uploaded onto Eilish's [[YouTube]] channel at the same time as the single's digital release. The video depicts Eilish being involved in several activities, including wild dancing, suffering a nosebleed and sitting on the back of a man doing [[push-up]]s. Reviewers noted the video for its [[camp (style)|camp]] elements and eccentric imagery. For promotional purposes, Eilish performed the song on several occasions and also included it on the set list for her [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] (2019) and [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]] (2020). On July 11, 2019, a remix of \"Bad Guy\" featuring Canadian singer [[Justin Bieber]] was released to mixed reviews from critics, who mostly commented on Bieber's vocals.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Finneas O'Connell 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg|150px|thumb|Eilish's brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (''pictured'') contributed to the song's writing and production.]]\n\n[[Billie Eilish]] released her debut studio album ''[[When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?]]'' on March 29, 2019, via Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brandle|first=Lars|title=Billie Eilish's Debut LP 'When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'

Elevators are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a [[hoist (device)|hoist]], although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a [[hydraulic jack|jack]].\n\nIn agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of [[conveyor]] device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or [[silo]]s. Several types exist, such as the chain and [[bucket elevator]], grain auger [[screw conveyor]] using the principle of [[Archimedes' screw]], or the chain and paddles or forks of [[hay elevator]]s. Languages other than English may have [[loanword]]s based on either ''elevator'' or ''lift''. Because of wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps would not be possible.\n\nThere are also some elevators which can go sideways in addition to the usual up-and-down motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.constructionweekonline.com/products-services/169354-germanys-thyssenkrupp-to-launch-revolutionary-rope-free-elevator-in-2022|title=This German company is inventing an elevator that goes sideways|website=Construction Week Online Middle East|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial era===\n[[File:Konrad Kyeser, Bellifortis, Clm 30150, Tafel 09, Blatt 38v (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|left|Elevator design by the German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] (1405)]]\n\nThe earliest known reference to an elevator is in the works of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]], who reported that [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC \u2013 c. 212 BC) built his first elevator probably in 236 BC.<ref>\"[http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-23/home-and-garden/17125291_1_taller-buildings-elevator-elisha-graves-otis Laying the foundation for today's skyscrapers]\".

The invention of a system based on the [[Leadscrew|screw drive]] was perhaps the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first screw drive elevator was built by [[Ivan Kulibin]] and installed in the [[Winter Palace]] in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RO5PAAAAMAAJ&q=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&dq=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHmq3y1pfoAhVERxUIHUdUAaoQ6AEIKTAA|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, Engineer and Architect|first1=Leonardo da|last1=Vinci|first2=Leonardo (da|last2=Vinci)|first3=Mus\u00e9e des|last3=Beaux-Arts (Montr\u00e9al)|first4=Pierre|last4=Th\u00e9berge|date=10 April 1987|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|via=Google Books}}</ref> Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in the [[Arkhangelskoye Palace|Arkhangelskoye]] near [[Moscow]].\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe development of elevators was led by the need for movement of raw materials including [[coal]] and [[lumber]] from hillsides. The technology developed by these industries and the introduction of steel beam construction worked together to provide the passenger and freight elevators in use today.\n\nStarting in the coal mines, by the mid-19th century elevators were operated with [[steam power]] and were used for moving goods in bulk in mines and factories. These steam driven devices were soon being applied to a diverse set of purposes\u2014in 1823, two [[architect]]s working in [[London]], Burton and Hormer, built and operated a novel tourist attraction, which they called the \"ascending room\". It elevated paying customers to a considerable height in the center of London, allowing them a magnificent panoramic view of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |title=Conveyor technology: Elevator |publisher=conveyor-tech.com |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621145810/http://www.conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEarly, crude steam-driven elevators were refined in the ensuing decade; in 1835, an innovative elevator called the \"Teagle\" was developed by the company Frost and Stutt in [[England]]. The elevator was belt-driven and used a [[counterweight]] for extra power.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/Elevator.htm |title=Learn Who Invented the Elevator and More |website=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe hydraulic crane was invented by Sir [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] in 1846, primarily for use at the [[Tyneside]] docks for loading cargo. These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting [[Pascal's law]], they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of [[water pressure]] to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered. Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus.\n\n[[Henry Waterman]] of New York is credited with inventing the \"standing rope control\" for an elevator in 1850.<ref Name=\"TheElevatorMuseumTimeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theelevatormuseum.org/timeline.php |title=EW Museum |website=Theelevatormuseum.org |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, the Neapolitan architect [[Gaetano Genovese]] installed in the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] the \"Flying Chair\", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside. It included a light, two benches and a hand-operated signal, and could be activated from the outside, without any effort on the part of the occupants. Traction was controlled by a motor mechanic utilising a system of toothed wheels. A safety system was designed to take effect if the cords broke. It consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.\n\n[[File:Elisha OTIS 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Elisha Otis]] demonstrating his safety system, [[New York Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], 1854]]\n\nIn 1852, [[Elisha Otis]] introduced the safety elevator, which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke.

His elevator ran faster and with larger loads than hydraulic or steam elevators, and 584 electric elevators were installed before Sprague sold his company to the Otis Elevator Company in 1895. Sprague also developed the idea and technology for multiple elevators in a single shaft.\n\nIn 1882, when [[fluid power|hydraulic power]] was a well established technology, a company later named the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]] was formed by [[Edward B.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a \"cage\", \"carriage\" or \"car\") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a \"hoistway\". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a \"traction\" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved [[pulley]], commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a [[counterweight]]. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.\n\nThe friction between the ropes and the pulley furnishes the traction which gives this type of elevator its name.\n\nHydraulic elevators use the principles of [[hydraulics]] (in the sense of [[fluid power|hydraulic power]]) to pressurise an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car (see ''Hydraulic elevators'' below). Roped hydraulics use a combination of both ropes and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars. Recent innovations include permanent magnet motors, machine room-less rail mounted gearless machines, and microprocessor controls.\n\nThe technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors. Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven floors, traction elevators must be employed instead. Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.\n\nElevators are a candidate for [[mass customisation]].\nThere are economies to be made from [[mass production]] of the components, but each building comes with its own requirements like different number of floors, dimensions of the well and usage patterns.\n\n===Doors===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nElevator [[doors]] prevent riders from falling into, entering, or tampering with anything in the shaft. The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large \"slab\" door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaftway, and double cascading doors on the cab.\n\n===Machine room-less (MRL) elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Kone EcoDisc.jpg|thumb|Kone EcoDisc. The entire drive system is in the hoistway]]\nMachine room-less elevators are designed so that most of the components fit within the shaft containing the elevator car; and a small cabinet houses the elevator controller. Other than the machinery being in the hoistway, the equipment is similar to a normal traction or hole-less hydraulic elevator. The world's first machine room-less elevator, the Kone MonoSpace was introduced in 1996, by [[Kone]].

Geared machines use [[worm gear]]s to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by \"rolling\" steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a [[gearbox]] driven by a high-speed motor. These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acelifts.com/news/traction-lifts-work/ |title=Traction Lifts: an infographic on how they work |author=ACE Lifts |work=ACE Lifts}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, AC motors were used for single or double-speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC [[Motor\u2013generator|motor generator]] were the preferred solution. The [[Motor\u2013generator|MG set]] also typically powered the [[relay logic|relay]] controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.\n\nThe widespread availability of variable frequency AC drives has allowed AC motors to be used universally, bringing with it the advantages of the older motor-generator, DC-based systems, without the penalties in terms of efficiency and complexity. The older MG-based installations are gradually being replaced in older buildings due to their poor energy efficiency.\n\nGearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-[[torque]] electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to {{convert|4000|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external [[drum brake|drum type]] and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see [[inherent safety]] and [[safety engineering]]). But it can also be some form of [[disc brake|disc type]] like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).\n\nIn each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a [[counterweight]] attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and is carried along a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerised device that directs starting, [[acceleration]], [[deceleration]] and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40\u201350% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \"[[Traction (engineering)|Traction]]\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalisation may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.\n\nElevators with more than {{convert|30|m|0|abbr=on}} of travel have a system called compensation. This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight tracks.\n\n===Regenerative drives===\nAnother energy-saving improvement is the regenerative drive,<ref>Debbie Sniderman, [https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/elevators/energy-efficient-elevator-technologies \"Energy Efficient Elevator Technologies\"], American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME Sept. 2012</ref> which works analogously to [[regenerative braking]] in vehicles, using the elevator's electric motor as a generator to capture some of the gravitational potential energy of descent of a full cab (heavier than its counterweight) or ascent of an empty cab (lighter than its counterweight) and return it to the building's electrical system.\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n[[File:Elevator hydraulic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pit of a hydraulic scenic elevator with metal grating on bottom. This elevator travels 7 stories.]]\n* ''Conventional hydraulic elevators''. They use an underground [[hydraulic cylinder]], are quite common for low level buildings with two to five floors (sometimes but seldom up to six to eight floors), and have speeds of up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. For higher rise applications, a telescopic hydraulic cylinder can be used.{{citation needed|reason=Hydraulic elevators with telescoping shafts are common, especially in 'holeless' or 'reduced depth hole' designs, but if there are any applications above about eight stories, this needs a cite|date=May 2016}}\n* ''Holeless hydraulic elevators'' were developed in the 1970s, and use a pair of above ground cylinders, which makes it practical for environmentally or cost sensitive buildings with two, three, or four floors.\n* ''Roped hydraulic elevators'' use both above ground cylinders and a rope system, allowing the elevator to travel further than the piston has to move.\n\nThe low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building's electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/elevator1.htm |title=How Elevators Work: Hydraulic Elevators |author=Harris, Tom |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=12 February 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern generation of low-cost, machine room-less traction elevators made possible by advances in [[miniaturisation]] of the traction motor and control systems challenges the supremacy of the hydraulic elevator in their traditional market niche.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Electromagnetic propulsion===\nCable-free elevators using [[electromagnetic propulsion]], capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm [[Thyssen Krupp]] for use in high rise, high density buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=MULTI \u2013 Rope-free elevator system \u2013 thyssenkrupp Elevator|url=https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|website=multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com|publisher=[[Thyssen Krupp]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119034447/https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|archive-date=19 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Condliffe|first1=Jamie|title=Meet the world's first cable-free elevator\u2014it can zoom horizontally or vertically|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608167/worlds-first-cable-free-elevator-zooms-horizontally-and-vertically-using-maglev-tech/|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Climbing elevator===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nA climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion. The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine. Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance. An example would be the [[moonlight tower]]s in Austin, Texas, where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance. The [[Glasgow Tower]]&nbsp;\u2014 an observation tower in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]&nbsp;\u2014 also makes use of two climbing elevators.  Temporary climbing elevators are commonly used in the construction of new high-rise buildings to move materials and personnel before the building's permanent elevator system is installed, at which point the climbing elevators are dismantled.\n\n===Pneumatic elevator===\nAn elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. A diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\", if there's a sudden increase in pressure above the cab. To go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurise the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. This also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. The \"shaft\" is made of acrylic, and is always round due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. To keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. Due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity, they usually allow 1\u20133 passengers and up to 525&nbsp;lbs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=Vacuum elevator gives users a gentle lift|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7353-vacuum-elevator-gives-users-a-gentle-lift/|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Controls==\n\n===Manual controls===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:OtisControl.jpg|thumb|Otis 1920s controller, operational in a New York City apartment building]]\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by [[elevator operator]]s using a [[rheostat]] connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder.\n\nThe elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft. Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a [[dead man switch]]: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.\n\nThis lever would allow some control over the energy supplied to the motor and so enabled the elevator to be accurately positioned&nbsp;\u2014 if the operator was sufficiently skilled. More typically, the operator would have to \"jog\" the control, moving the cab in small increments until the elevator was reasonably close to the landing point. Then the operator would direct the outgoing and incoming passengers to \"watch the step\".\n[[File:mit-old-elevator-panel.jpg|thumb|Manual pushbutton elevator controls]]\n\nAutomatic elevators began to appear as early as the 1920s,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} their development being hastened by [[strike action|striking]] elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers (and therefore their elevators) such as New York and Chicago to their knees. Self service elevators were not allowed in New York City until 1922.  Prior to this, non-luxury buildings that could not afford an attendant were built as five-story walk ups.  These electromechanical systems used [[relay logic]] circuits of increasing complexity to control the speed, position and door operation of an elevator or bank of elevators.\n\nThe Otis ''Autotronic'' system of the early 1950s brought the earliest predictive systems which could anticipate traffic patterns within a building to deploy elevator movement in the most efficient manner. Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, [[microprocessor]]-based controls are now the industry standard. Most older, manually-operated elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.\n\n[[File:Dover elevator button.jpg|thumb|Typical freight elevator control station]]\n[[File:Dover Impulse at Bob's Furniture - Nashua, NH.jpg|thumb|Typical passenger elevator control station]]\n[[File:Ringing the elevator alarm.jpg|thumb|Using the emergency call button in an elevator.

In many countries, button text and icons are raised to allow blind users to operate the elevator; many have [[Braille]] text besides. Buttons include:\n** Call buttons to choose a floor. Some of these may be key switches (to control access). In some elevators, certain floors are inaccessible unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode (or both).\n** Door open and door close buttons.\n\nThe operation of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the door closes.

In this case (hastening normal closure), the door close button has no effect. However, the door close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the door close will immediately close the door, for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic door closing in the US is 5 seconds,<ref>ASME A17.1 \u2013 2000, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Requirements 4.10.7 \u2013 Door and Signal Timing for Hall Calls, \"The minimum acceptable notification time shall be 5 seconds.\"</ref> which is a noticeable delay if not over-ridden.\n* An alarm button or switch, which passengers can use to warn the premises manager that they have been trapped in the elevator.\n* A set of doors kept locked on each floor to prevent unintentional access into the elevator shaft by the unsuspecting individual. The door is unlocked and opened by a machine sitting on the roof of the car, which also drives the doors that travel with the car. Door controls are provided to close immediately or reopen the doors, although the button to close them immediately is often disabled during normal operations, especially on more recent elevators. Objects in the path of the moving doors will either be detected by sensors or physically activate a switch that reopens the doors. Otherwise, the doors will close after a preset time. Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.  Regulations often require doors to close after use to prevent smoke from entering the elevator shaft in event of fire.\n* Elevators in high traffic buildings often have a \"nudge\" function (the Otis ''Autotronic'' system first introduced this feature){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} which will close the doors at a reduced speed, and sound a buzzer if the \"door open\" button is being deliberately held down, or if the door sensors have been blocked for too long a time.\n* A stop switch (not allowed under British regulations{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}) to halt the elevator while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this will most likely be a [[key switch]].\n\nSome elevators may have one or more of the following:\n* An [[Emergency telephone|elevator telephone]], which can be used (in addition to the alarm) by a trapped passenger to call for help. This may consist of a transceiver, or simply a button.  This feature is often required by local regulations.\n* Hold button: This button delays the door closing timer, useful for loading freight and hospital beds.\n* Call cancellation: A destination floor may be deselected by double clicking.\n* Access restriction by key switches, RFID reader, code keypad, hotel room card, etc.\n* One or more additional sets of doors. This is primarily used to serve different floor plans: on each floor only one set of doors opens. For example, in an elevated crosswalk setup, the front doors may open on the street level, and the rear doors open on the crosswalk level. This is also common in garages, rail stations, and airports. Alternatively, both doors may open on a given floor. This is sometimes timed so that one side opens first for getting off, and then the other side opens for getting on, to improve boarding/exiting speed. This is particularly useful when passengers have luggage or carts, as at an airport, due to reduced manoeuvrability.\n**[[File:Dual elevator door buttons - cropped.jpg|thumb|Dual door open and door close buttons, in an elevator with two sets of doors.]] In case of dual doors, there may be two sets of door open and door close buttons, with one pair controlling the front doors, from the perspective of the console, typically denoted &lt;&gt; and &gt;&lt;, with the other pair controlling the rear doors, typically denoted with a line in the middle, <nowiki>&lt;|&gt; and &gt;|&lt;</nowiki>, or double lines, <nowiki>|&lt;&gt;| and &gt;||&lt;</nowiki>.

This mode may be used for temporarily transporting goods.\n* Attendant service mode\n* Large buildings with multiple elevators of this type also had an ''elevator dispatcher'' stationed in the lobby to direct passengers and to signal the operator to leave with the use of a mechanical \"cricket\" noisemaker.\n\n===External controls===\n[[File:External lift control panel.jpg|thumb|An external control panel]]\n\nElevators are typically controlled from the outside by a call box, which has up and down buttons, at each stop. When pressed at a certain floor, the button (also known as a \"hall call\" button) calls the elevator to pick up more passengers. If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls in the same direction unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.\n\nIn a group of two or more elevators, the call buttons may be linked to a central dispatch computer, such that they illuminate and cancel together. This is done to ensure that only one car is called at one time.\n\nKey switches may be installed on the ground floor so that the elevator can be remotely switched on or off from the outside.\n\nIn destination control systems, one selects the intended destination floor (in lieu of pressing ''\"up\"'' or ''\"down\"'') and is then notified which elevator will serve their request.\n\n===Floor numbering===\n[[File:Missing Floor 13.jpg|thumb|Elevator buttons showing the missing [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]]]]\n{{further|Floor numbering}}\n{{empty section|date=March 2020}}\n===Elevator algorithm===\nThe [[elevator algorithm]], a simple [[algorithm]] by which a single elevator can decide where to stop, is summarised as follows:\n* Continue travelling in the same direction while there are remaining requests in that same direction.\n* If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.\nThe elevator algorithm has found an application in computer [[operating system]]s as an algorithm for scheduling [[hard disk]] requests.\nModern elevators use more complex [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic algorithms]] to decide which request to service next. An introduction to these algorithms can be found in the \"Elevator traffic handbook: theory and practice\" given in the references below.\n\n===Destination control system===\n{{main|Destination dispatch}}\n[[File:Destination control elevator floor selection.jpg|thumb|A destination control elevator floor selection panel at [[Northeastern University]] in Boston, United States]]\nSome skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.\n\nIt can also improve accessibility, as a mobility-impaired passenger can move to his or her designated car in advance.\n\nInside the elevator there is no call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed&nbsp;\u2014 except door opening and alarm button&nbsp;\u2014 they only indicate stopping floors.\n\nThe idea of destination control was originally conceived by [[Leo Port]] from Sydney in 1961,<ref>Port, L.W. (1961), Elevator System Commonwealth of Australia Patent Specification, Application Number 1421/61, 14 February 1961</ref> but at that time elevator controllers were implemented in relays and were unable to optimise the performance of destination control allocations.\n\nThe system was first pioneered by [[Schindler Group|Schindler Elevator]] in 1992 as the Miconic 10. Manufacturers of such systems claim that average travelling time can be reduced by up to 30%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.schindler.com/SEC/websecen.nsf/pages/elev-MHR-Mic10-01 |title=Schindler Elevators, Escalators, Moving Walks Service Mod Company |website=Schindler.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, performance enhancements cannot be generalised as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peters-research.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100%3Aunderstanding-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-destination-control&catid=3%3Apapers&Itemid=1 |title=Peters Research Ltd |author=Richard Peters |work=peters-research.com}}</ref> One problem is that the system is subject to gaming. Sometimes, one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor. The dispatching [[algorithm]] is usually unable to completely cater for the variation, and latecomers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full. Also, occasionally, one person may press the floor multiple times. This is common with up/down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators. However, this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person.\n\nTo prevent this problem, in one implementation of destination control, every user is given an [[RFID]] card, for identification and tracking, so that the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination, preventing empty calls. The newest invention knows even where people are located and how many on which floor because of their identification, either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theporttechnology.com/page/systemoperation.html |title=The PORT Technology :: System Operation |work=theporttechnology.com}}</ref> Another way to prevent this issue is to treat everyone travelling from one floor to another as one group and to allocate only one car for that group.\n\nThe same destination scheduling concept can also be applied to public transit such as in [[group rapid transit]].\n[[File:DestinationDispatchElevator.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[destination dispatch]] control station, outside of the car, on which the user presses a button to indicate the desired destination floor, and the panel indicates which car will be dispatched]]\n\n==Special operating modes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Anti-crime protection===\nThe anti-crime protection (ACP) feature will force each car to stop at a pre-defined landing and open its doors. This allows a security guard or a receptionist at the landing to visually inspect the passengers. The car stops at this landing as it passes to serve further demand.\n\n===Up peak===\nDuring up-peak mode (also called moderate incoming traffic), elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period when people are going back to work. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a \"this car leaving next\" sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.\n\nThe commencement of up-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the departure of a certain number of fully loaded cars leaving the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Down peak===\nDuring down-peak mode, elevator cars in a group are sent away from the lobby towards the highest floor served, after which they commence running down the floors in response to hall calls placed by passengers wishing to leave the building. This allows the elevator system to provide maximum passenger handling capacity for people leaving the building.\n\nThe commencement of down-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the arrival of a certain number of fully loaded cars at the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Sabbath service===\n[[File:Sabbath on-off.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A switch to turn Sabbath elevator mode on or off]]\n\nIn areas with large populations of observant [[Jew]]s or in facilities catering to Jews, one may find a \"[[Sabbath elevator]]\". In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without having to push any buttons. This prevents violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibition against operating electrical devices when Sabbath is in effect for those who observe this ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/39/Q1/ |title=Shabbat Elevators |work=Ohr Somayach}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Sabbath mode has the side effect of using considerable amounts of energy, running the elevator car sequentially up and down every floor of a building, repeatedly servicing floors where it is not needed. For a tall building with many floors, the car must move on a frequent enough basis so as to not cause undue delay for potential users that will not touch the controls as it opens the doors on every floor up the building.\n\nSome taller buildings may have the Sabbath elevator alternate floors in order to save time and energy; for example, an elevator may stop at only even-numbered floors on the way up, and then the odd-numbered floors on the way down.\n\n===Independent service===\nIndependent service or car preference is a special mode found on most elevators. It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralised control panel in the lobby. When an elevator is placed on this mode, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.\n\n===Inspection service===\nInspection service is designed to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labelled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB' (short for HoistWay access ENABled). When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be cancelled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or cancelled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.\n\nElevators have a car top inspection station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic in order to move it through the hoistway. Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button. The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.\n\n===Fire service===\nDepending on the location of the elevator, fire service code will vary state to state and country to country. Fire service is usually split up into two modes: phase one and phase two. These are separate modes that the elevator can go into.\n\nPhase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.\n\n[[File:KONE Ecodisc Elevator in Fireman's Mode.jpg|thumb|KONE Ecodisc elevator in fireman's mode]]\n\nPhase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralised control panel. This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two key switch located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, the firefighter enables the car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and the firefighter can feel the heat and knows not to open the door. The firefighter must hold the door open button until the door is completely opened. If for any reason the firefighter wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the key switch to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If the firefighter wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.\n\n===Medical emergency or code-blue service===\nCommonly found in hospitals, code-blue service allows an elevator to be summoned to any floor for use in an emergency situation. Each floor will have a code-blue recall key switch, and when activated, the elevator system will immediately select the elevator car that can respond the fastest, regardless of direction of travel and passenger load. Passengers inside the elevator will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit the elevator when the doors open.\n\nOnce the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.\n\n===Riot mode===\nIn the event of civil disturbance, insurrection, or rioting, management can prevent elevators from stopping at the lobby or parking areas, preventing undesired persons from using the elevators while still allowing the building tenants to use them within the rest of the building.\n\n===Emergency power operation===\nMany elevator installations now feature emergency power systems such as [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) which allow elevator use in blackout situations and prevent people from becoming trapped in elevators. To be compliant with BS 9999 safety standards, a passenger lift being used in an emergency situation must have a secondary source of power. In many cases, providing a secondary mains feed simply isn't possible, so a UPS and or generator combination is used instead.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhere a generator is being used as the secondary power supply in a hospital, a UPS must also be present to meet regulations stating that healthcare facilities must test their emergency generators under load at least once per month. During the test period only one supply of power is feeding the lift, in a blackout situation without a UPS, the lifts would not be operational.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Traction elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nWhen power is lost in a traction elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors, and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually over-ridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby. To help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors, and shut down.\n\n====Hydraulic elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nIn hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \"soft-start\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.\n\n==Modernization==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:G1TOWER view from Art Tower Mito.jpg|thumb|An elevator test tower]]\nMost elevators are built to provide about 30 to 40 years of service, as long as service intervals specified and periodic maintenance/inspections by the manufacturer are followed. As the elevator ages and equipment become increasingly difficult to find or replace, along with code changes and deteriorating ride performance, a complete overhaul of the elevator may be suggested to the building owners.\n\nA typical modernization consists of controller equipment, electrical wiring and buttons, position indicators and direction arrows, hoist machines and motors (including door operators), and sometimes door hanger tracks. Rarely are car slings, rails, or other heavy structures changed. The cost of an elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.\n\nModernization can greatly improve operational reliability by replacing mechanical relays and contacts with solid-state electronics. Ride quality can be improved by replacing motor-generator-based drive designs with [[Variable-frequency drive|Variable-Voltage, Variable Frequency (V3F) drives]], providing near-seamless acceleration and deceleration. Passenger safety is also improved by updating systems and equipment to conform to current codes.\n\n==Safety==\n{{See also|List of elevator accidents}}\nOn 26 February 2014, the European union released their adoption of safety standards through a directive notification.<ref>{{Citation|title=Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts Text with EEA relevance|date=29 March 2014|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/33/oj/eng|volume=OJ L|issue=32014L0033|language=en|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Cable-borne elevators===\n[[File:Elevator speed governor.jpg|thumb|Governor]]\nStatistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related&nbsp;\u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts,<ref name=\"windypundit.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.windypundit.com/archives/2008/04/elevator_of_deathnot_really.html |title=Elevator of Death...Or Not \u2013 Windypundit |work=Windypundit|date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> In fact, prior to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a [[B-25 Empire State Building crash|B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building]] in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant&nbsp;\u2014 the elevator operator.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all |title=Up and Then Down |date=21 April 2008 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/4-elevators-shut-down-by-inspectors-1253339.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |first1=Aubrey |last1=Cohen |title=4 Elevators Shut Down By Inspectors |date=23 October 2007}}</ref> This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by [[Elisha Graves Otis]].<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> However, in Thailand in November 2012, a woman was killed in a free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Woman-drops-to-her-death-in-lift-plunge-30194663.html |title=Woman drops to her death in lift plunge |date=20 November 2012 |work=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nPast problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible [[catastrophic failure]]. The code previously permitted only single-bottom [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. Two commercially available are known by the marketing names \"LifeJacket\" and \"HydroBrake\". The plunger gripper is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of [[hydraulic fluid]], thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators, there is risk of leaking [[hydraulic oil]] into the [[aquifer]] and causing potential environmental contamination. This has led to the introduction of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] liners (casings) around hydraulic cylinders which can be monitored for integrity.\n\nIn the past decade, recent innovations in inverted [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic jacks]] have eliminated the costly process of drilling the ground to install a borehole jack. This also eliminates the threat of corrosion to the system and increases safety.\n\n===Mine-shaft elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nSafety testing of [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] elevator rails is routinely undertaken. The method involves destructive testing of a segment of the cable. The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical [[zinc moulds]]. Each end of the segment is then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine. The segment is then placed under increasing load to the point of [[failure]]. Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analysed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:LUP-Interior.JPG|thumb|A [[Fujitec]] traction elevator in Block 192, Bishan, [[Singapore]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Passenger service===\nA passenger elevator is designed to move people between a building's floors.\n\nPassenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space. Generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from {{convert|1000|to(-)|6000|lb|kg|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}} in {{convert|500|lb|kg|adj=on|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}} increments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric, which can reach speeds up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} hydraulic and up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} electric.

For example, there is a 3-station underground public elevator in [[Yalta]], [[Ukraine]], which takes passengers from the top of a hill above the Black Sea on which hotels are perched, to a tunnel located on the beach below. At Casco Viejo station in the [[Bilbao Metro]], the elevator that provides access to the station from a hilltop neighbourhood doubles as city transportation: the station's ticket barriers are set up in such a way that passengers can pay to reach the elevator from the entrance in the lower city, or vice versa. See also the [[Elevator#Elevators for urban transport|Elevators for urban transport]] section.\n\n====Types of passenger elevators====\n[[File:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangement.svg|thumb|The former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s twin towers used [[skylobby|skylobbies]], located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower]]\n\nPassenger elevators may be specialised for the service they perform, including: hospital emergency ([[code blue]]), front and rear entrances, a television in high-rise buildings, [[double-deck elevator|double-decker]], and other uses. Cars may be ornate in their interior appearance, may have audio visual advertising, and may be provided with specialised recorded voice announcements. Elevators may also have [[loudspeakers]] in them to play calm, easy listening music. Such music is often referred to as [[elevator music]].\n\nAn express elevator does not serve all floors. For example, it moves between the ground floor and a [[skylobby]], or it moves from the ground floor or a skylobby to a range of floors, skipping floors in between. These are especially popular in eastern Asia.\n\n====Capacity====\nResidential elevators may be small enough to only accommodate one person while some are large enough for more than a dozen.

It is very basic yet rugged for freight loading.]]\n\nA freight elevator, or goods lift, is an elevator designed to carry goods, rather than passengers. Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500&nbsp;kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator#Cable-borne_elevators Cable-Borne Elevators], or Traction Elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting, especially in taller buildings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Sidewalk elevators===\nA '''sidewalk elevator''' is a special type of freight elevator. Sidewalk elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the [[sidewalk]] just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. Sidewalk elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com/sidewalk_p1.html |title=elevatorbob's Elevator Pictures \u2013 Sidewalk Elevators \u2013 Page 1 |author=Bob Desnoyers |work=elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage lifts===\n\n<!-- \"Stage lifts\" links here -->\n'''Stage lifts''' and '''orchestra lifts''' are specialised elevators, typically powered by hydraulics, that are used to raise and lower entire sections of a theatre stage. For example, [[Radio City Music Hall]] has four such elevators: an orchestra lift that covers a large area of the stage, and three smaller lifts near the rear of the stage. In this case, the orchestra lift is powerful enough to raise an entire orchestra, or an entire cast of performers (including live elephants) up to stage level from below. There's a barrel on the background of the image of the left which can be used as a scale to represent the size of the mechanism\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"250px\">\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift1.JPG|The pit beneath the orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift2.jpg|Orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall as viewed from beneath the stage\n</gallery>\n\n===Vehicle elevators===\n{{main article|Car elevator}}\nVehicular elevators are used within buildings or areas with limited space (in place of ramps), generally to move [[car]]s into the parking garage or manufacturer's storage. Geared hydraulic chains (not unlike bicycle chains) generate lift for the platform and there are no counterweights. To accommodate building designs and improve accessibility, the platform may rotate so that the driver only has to drive forward. Most vehicle elevators have a weight capacity of 2 tons.\n\nRare examples of extra-heavy elevators for 20-ton [[lorry|lorries]], and even for [[railcar]]s (like one that was used at [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro Station]] of the [[Kiev Metro]]) also occur.\n\n===Boat lift===\n{{Main|Boat lift}}\n\nIn some smaller canals, boats and small ships can pass between different levels of a canal with a boat elevator rather than through a [[lock (water transport)|canal lock]].\n\n===Aircraft elevators===\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|An [[F/A-18]]C on an aircraft elevator of {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n====For aircraft====\nOn [[aircraft carrier]]s, elevators carry aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar deck for operations or repairs. These elevators are designed for much greater capacity than other elevators, up to {{convert|200000|lb||order=flip|abbr=on}} of aircraft and equipment. Smaller elevators lift munitions to the flight deck from magazines deep inside the ship.\n\n====Within aircraft====\nOn some passenger [[double-deck aircraft]] such as the [[Boeing 747]] or other [[widebody aircraft]], elevators transport flight attendants and food and beverage trolleys from lower deck [[galley (kitchen)|galleys]] to upper passenger carrying decks.<ref name=\"Bowman2014\">{{cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Martin |title=Boeing 747: A History: Delivering the Dream |date=2014 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-4738-3823-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej0RBQAAQBAJ|language=en |chapter=5 |quote=This 747, delivered to the Australian carrier in July 1971, was also the first to feature a lower-deck galley, reached by an internal elevator system.}}</ref>\n\n===Limited use and limited application===\nThe limited-use, limited-application (LU/LA) elevator is a special purpose passenger elevator used infrequently, and which is exempt from many commercial regulations and accommodations. For example, a LU/LA is primarily meant to be handicapped accessible, and there might only be room for a single wheelchair and a standing passenger.\n\n===Residential elevator===\n[[File:Visilift Visi-58 Round Residential Elevator.jpg|thumb|A residential elevator with integrated hoistway construction and machine-room-less design]]\n\nA residential elevator or [[home lift]] is often permitted to be of lower cost and complexity than full commercial elevators. They may have unique design characteristics suited for home furnishings, such as hinged wooden shaft-access doors rather than the typical metal sliding doors of commercial elevators. Construction may be less robust than in commercial designs with shorter maintenance periods, but safety systems such as locks on shaft access doors, fall arrestors, and emergency phones must still be present in the event of malfunction.\n\nThe [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) has a specific section of Safety Code (ASME A17.1 Section 5.3) which addresses Residential Elevators. This section allows for different parameters to alleviate design complexity based on the limited use of a residential elevator by a specific user or user group. Section 5.3 of the ASME A17.1 Safety Code is for Private Residence Elevators, which does not include multi-family dwellings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety code for elevators and escalators : includes requirements for elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, moving walks, material elevators, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices |year=2007 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0791830390 |page=532 |author=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}</ref>\n\nSome types of residential elevators do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator hoistway. This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation. The ASME board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the ASME A17.1 in 2007. Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Elevator Technology: The Machine Room-Less Elevator |url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |work=Architectural Record |publisher=McGraw Hill Financial |access-date=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516193821/http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso, residential elevators are smaller than commercial elevators. The smallest passenger elevator is pneumatic, and it allows for only 1 person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumelevators.com/pve30 |title=30\" Vacuum Elevators For Sale &#124; Pneumatic Vacuum Elevators |website=Vacuumelevators.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\nThe smallest traction elevator allows for just 2 persons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mh-he.co.jp/family_product/ |title=\u5bb6\u5ead\u30fb\u4f4f\u5b85\u7528\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u4e09\u83f1\u65e5\u7acb\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30a8\u30ec\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc |website=Mh-he.co.jp |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Dumbwaiter===\n{{Main|Dumbwaiter}}\nDumbwaiters are small freight elevators that are intended to carry food, books or other small freight loads rather than passengers. They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.\n\n===Paternoster===\n[[File:BMF Paternoster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[paternoster lift|paternoster]] in [[Berlin]], Germany]]\n{{Main|Paternoster elevator}}\n\nA special type of elevator is the [[paternoster lift|paternoster]], a constantly moving chain of boxes. A similar concept, called the [[belt manlift|manlift]] or [[humanlift]], moves only a small platform, which the rider mounts while using a handhold seen in multi-story industrial plants.\n\n===Scissor lift===\n[[File:Hebebuehne Scissorlift.jpg|right|thumb|A mobile scissor lift, extended to near its highest position]]\n\nThe [[scissor lift]] is yet another type of lift. These are usually mobile work platforms that can be easily moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a [[scissor jack]].\n\n===Rack-and-pinion elevator===\n[[Rack-and-pinion]] elevator are powered by a motor driving a pinion gear. Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior and there is no machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gedausa.com/rack-and-pinion-elevators.html |title=Rack and Pinion Elevators \u2013 Rack and Pinion Lift \u2013 GEDA \u2013 USA |website=Gedausa.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Material handling belts and belt elevators===\nMaterial transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a [[grain elevator]]. Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of [[bulk carrier]]s\n\nThere have occasionally been [[belt manlift|belt lifts]] for humans; these typically have steps about every {{convert|2|m|1|abbr=on}} along the length of the belt, which moves vertically, so that the passenger can stand on one step and hold on to the one above. These belts are sometimes used, for example, to carry the employees of parking garages, but are considered too dangerous for public use.\n\n==Social impact==\nBefore the widespread use of elevators, most residential buildings were limited to about seven stories. The wealthy lived on lower floors, while poorer residents\u2014required to climb many flights of stairs\u2014lived on higher floors. The elevator reversed this social stratification, exemplified by the modern penthouse suite.<ref name=\"Bethune\">{{cite web |last=Bethune |first=Brian |title=How the Elevator Changed Everything |publisher=Maclean's |date=24 March 2014 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-the-elevator-changed-everything-2/}}</ref>\n\nEarly users of elevators sometimes reported nausea caused by abrupt stops while descending, and some users would use stairs to go down. In 1894, a Chicago physician documented \"elevator sickness\".<ref name=\"Bethune\"/>\n\nElevators necessitated new social protocols. When [[Nicholas II of Russia]] visited the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons. In ''Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator'', author Andreas Bernard documents other social impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space and [[claustrophobia]], and concerns about personal hygiene.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Lift, a Life, Lift-Off: The Bucket on Ropes that Changed the World |work=The Economist|date=15 February 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21596491-bucket-ropes-changed-world-lift}}</ref>\n\n==Convenience features==\n[[File:LCD elevator indicator.JPG|thumb|LCD elevator floor indicator]]\n[[File:WaldolfAstoriaElevatorjpg.JPG|thumb|A typical elevator indicator located in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]]. This elevator was made by Otis.]]\nElevators may feature talking devices as an accessibility aid for the blind. In addition to floor arrival notifications, the computer announces the direction of travel (OTIS is well known for this in some of their GEN2 model elevators), and notifies the passengers before the doors are to close.\n\nIn addition to the call buttons, elevators usually have floor indicators (often illuminated by [[LED]]) and direction lanterns. The former are almost universal in cab interiors with more than two stops and may be found outside the elevators as well on one or more of the floors. Floor indicators can consist of a [[dial (measurement)|dial]] with a rotating [[measuring instrument|needle]], but the most common types are those with successively illuminated floor indications or [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]]. Likewise, a change of floors or an arrival at a floor is indicated by a sound, depending on the elevator.\n\nDirection lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator. If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator. If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green (or white) means \"up\". Since the colour convention is often undermined or over-ridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the colour convention to differentiate between directions is the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.\n\nIn addition to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open, usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up. For example, one chime can indicate \"up\", two \"down\", and no chimes indicate an elevator that is 'free'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf#page=40|title=Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities|author=<!-- not applicable -->|at=Section 4.10.4 Hall Lanterns (p. 37)|publisher=[[United States Access Board|U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board)]]|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=A visible and audible signal shall be provided at each hoistway entrance to indicate which car is answering a call.

It stabilises the condition of the air inside the elevator car. Some elevator air conditioners can be used in countries with cold climates if a thermostat is used to reverse the refrigeration cycle to warm the elevator car.\n\nHeat generated from the cooling process is dissipated into the hoistway. The elevator cab (or car) is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.\n\nThe air from the lobby constantly leaks into the elevator shaft due to elevator movements as well as elevator shaft ventilation requirements. Using this conditioned air in the elevator does not increase energy costs. However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.\n\nAir conditioning poses a problem to elevators because of the condensation that occurs. The condensed water produced has to be disposed of; otherwise, it would create flooding in the elevator car and hoistway.\n\n====Methods of removing condensed water====\nThere are at least four ways to remove condensed water from the air conditioner. However, each solution has its pros and cons.\n\n====Atomizing====\nAtomizing, also known as misting the condensed water, is one way to dispose of the condensed water. Spraying ultra-fine water droplets onto the hot coils of the air conditioner ensures that the condensed water evaporates quickly.\n\nThough this is one of the best methods to dispose of the condensed water, it is also one of the costliest because the nozzle that atomises the water easily gets choked. The majority of the cost goes to maintaining the entire atomising system.\n\n====Boiling====\nDisposing of condensed water works by firstly collecting the condensed water and then heating it to above boiling point. The condensed water is eventually evaporated, thereby disposing of it.\n\nConsumers are reluctant to employ this system because of the high rate of energy used just to dispose of this water.\n\n====Cascading====\nThe cascading method works by flowing the condensed water directly onto the hot coils of the air conditioner. This eventually evaporates the condensed water.\n\nThe downside of this technology is that the coils have to be at extremely high temperature for the condensed water to be evaporated. There is a chance that the water might not evaporate entirely and that would cause water to overflow onto the exterior of the car.\n\n====Drainage system====\nDrainage system works by creating a sump to collect the condensed water and using a pump to dispose of it through a drainage system.\n\nIt is an efficient method, but it comes at a heavy price because the cost of building the sump. Moreover, maintaining the pump to make sure it operates is very expensive. Furthermore, the pipes used for drainage would look ugly on the exterior. This system also cannot be implemented on a built project.\n\n==ISO 22559==\n[[File:Licenciado Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz International Airport (2014) - 03.JPG|thumb|right|A symbol for elevator]]\n[[File:Kaohsiung Mosque - Elevator.jpg|thumb|Elevator for the [[disability|disabled]] at [[Kaohsiung Mosque]] in [[Taiwan]]]]\n\nThe mechanical and electrical design of elevators is dictated according to various standards (aka elevator codes), which may be international, national, state, regional or city based. Whereas once many standards were prescriptive, specifying exact criteria which must be complied with, there has recently been a shift towards more performance-based standards where the onus falls on the designer to ensure that the elevator meets or exceeds the standard.\n\nNational elevator standards:\n* Australia \u2013 AS1735\n* Canada \u2013 CAN/CSA B44\n* Europe \u2013 EN 81 series (EN 81-1, EN 81-2, EN 81-28, EN 81-70, EN 12015, EN 12016, EN 13015, etc.)\n* India \u2013 Indian Standard \u2013 Installation and Maintenance of home lifts (Code of practice 2002)<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.15259.2002|title=IS 15259: Installation and Maintenance of Home Lifts \u2013 Code of Practice|last=Bureau of Indian Standards|date=2002|others=Public.Resource.Org|language=English}}</ref>\n* USA \u2013 ASME A17\n\nconverged in ISO 22559 series, \"Safety requirements for lifts (elevators)\":<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lift-report.de/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,print,0&cntnt01articleid=462&cntnt01showtemplate=false&cntnt01returnid=432 |title=New EN 81 goes ISO ... |work=lift-report.de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61455 |title=ISO 22559-1:2014 \u2013 Safety requirements for lifts (elevators) \u2013 Part 1: Global essential safety requirements (GESRs) |work=iso.org}}</ref>\n* Part 1: Global essential safety requirements (GESRs).\n* Part 2: Safety parameters meeting the global essential safety requirements (GESRs).\n* Part 3: Global conformity assessment procedures (GCAP) \u2013 Prerequisites for certification of conformity of lift systems, lift components and lift functions\n* Part 4: Global conformity assessment procedures (GCAP) \u2013 Certification and accreditation requirements\n\n[[ISO/TC 178]] is the Technical Committee on Lifts, [[escalator]]s and [[moving walk]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/other_bodies/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=53970 |title=ISO \u2013 Technical committees \u2013 ISO/TC 178 \u2013 Lifts, escalators and moving walks |work=iso.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=53970&published=on&includesc=true |title=ISO \u2013 ISO Standards \u2013 ISO/TC 178 \u2013 Lifts, escalators and moving walks |work=iso.org}}</ref>\n\nBecause an elevator is part of a building, it must also comply with [[building code]] standards relating to [[earthquake resilience]], [[fire standard]]s, [[electrical wiring rule]]s and so forth.\n\nThe American National Elevator Standards Group (ANESG) sets an elevator weight standard to be {{convert|2200|lbs|-1|order=flip|abbr=on}}.\n\nAdditional requirements relating to access by disabled persons, may be mandated by laws or regulations such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].

The operations of these elevators are synchronised by a light signal in the car.\n\n=== Statue of Unity ===\n[[File:Statue of Unity in 2018 (cropped).jpg|alt=Statue of Unity, Gujarat, India|thumb|[[Statue of Unity|Statue of Unity, Gujarat, India]]]]\nThe [[Statue of Unity]], the world's tallest statue at {{convert|182|m|ft}} high, has 10 high speed ({{convert|4|m/s|ft/s}}) elevators leading up to a viewing gallery {{convert|153|m|ft}} high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/marketing/otis-to-give-a-lift-to-the-top-of-the-statue-of-unity/66630400|title=Otis to give a 'lift' to the top of the Statue of Unity \u2013 ET BrandEquity|last=www.ETBrandEquity.com|website=ETBrandEquity.com|language=en|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Taipei 101===\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317101\u7684\u5347\u964d\u6a5f.JPG|left|thumb|The observation deck elevator floor indicator in the Taipei 101]]\n\nDouble deck elevators, installed by [[Toshiba]] using [[Kone]] EcoDisc machinery,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} are used in the [[Taipei 101]] office tower. Tenants of even-numbered floors first take an escalator (or an elevator from the parking garage) to the 2nd level, where they will enter the upper deck and arrive at their floors. The lower deck is turned off during low-volume hours, and the upper deck can act as a single-level elevator stopping at all adjacent floors. For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor. A bank of express elevators stop only on the sky lobby levels (36 and 60, upper-deck car), where tenants can transfer to \"local\" elevators.\n\nThe high-speed observation deck elevators accelerate to a world-record certified speed of {{convert|1010|m/min|km/h|0}} in 16 seconds, and then it slows down for arrival with subtle air pressure sensations. The door opens after 37 seconds from the 5th floor. Special features include aerodynamic car and counterweights, and cabin pressure control to help passengers adapt smoothly to pressure changes. The downwards journey is completed at a reduced speed of 600 meters per minute, with the doors opening at the 52nd second.\n\n===Gateway Arch===\n[[File:Gateway Arch tram car.JPG|thumb|The interior of one of the Gateway Arch tramway cars]]\n{{Main|Gateway Arch}}\n\nThe Gateway Arch in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, has a unique [[Montgomery Elevator|Montgomery]] elevator system which carries passengers from the visitors' center underneath the Arch to the observation deck at the top of the structure.\n\nCalled a ''tram'' or ''tramway'', people enter this unique [[tram]]way much as one would enter an ordinary elevator, through double doors. Passing through the doors the passengers in small groups enter a horizontal cylindrical compartment containing seats on each side and a flat floor. A number of these compartments are linked to form a train. These compartments each individually retain an appropriate level orientation by tilting while the entire train follows curved tracks up one leg of the arch.\n\nThere are two tramways within the Arch, one at the north end, and the other at the south end. The entry doors have windows, so people travelling within the Arch are able to see the interior structure of the Arch during the ride to and from the observation deck. At the beginning of the trip the cars hang from the drive cables, but as the angle of the shaft changes, they end up beside and then on top of the cables.\n\n[[File:ElevatorShaftHannoverNewCityHallLookingUp.jpg|thumb|left|View up the shaft of the elevator at the New City Hall, [[Hanover]], Germany]]\n\n===New City Hall, Hanover, Germany===\n[[File:ElevatorHannoverNewCityHallSketch.png|thumb|100px|Elevator in the new city hall, Hanover, Germany, showing the cabin at the bottom and the top]]\n\nThe elevator in the [[New City Hall (Hanover)|New City Hall]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], is a technical rarity, and unique in Europe, as the elevator starts straight up but\nthen changes its angle by 15 degrees to follow the contour of the dome of the hall. The cabin therefore tilts 15 degrees during the ride. The elevator travels a height of 43 meters. The new city hall was built in 1913. The elevator was destroyed in 1943 and rebuilt in 1954.\n\n===Luxor incline elevator===\nThe [[Luxor Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], United States, has [[inclined elevator]]s. The shape of this casino is a [[pyramid]]. Therefore, the elevator travels up the side of the pyramid at a 39-degree angle. Other locations with inclined elevators include the [[Cityplace (DART station)|Cityplace Station]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], the [[Huntington (WMATA station)|Huntington Metro Station]] in [[Huntington, Virginia]], and the [[San Diego Convention Center]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\n===Germany===\nAt the Radisson Blue in Berlin, Germany, the main elevator is surrounded by an aquarium; 82 feet tall, the aquarium contains more than a thousand different fish and offers views to people using the elevator.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://au.totaltravel.yahoo.com/galleries/g/29194655/now-thats-a-lot-of-water/29194656/#1 |title=Hotel lobby goes under the sea |website=Au.totaltravel.yahoo.com |date=6 August 2015 |access-date=26 April 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror}}\n\nThe Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is the common name for a series of elevator attractions at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] park in Orlando, the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in Paris and the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] park in Tokyo. The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and [[counterweight]] are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.\n\nThe passenger cabs are mechanically separated from the lift mechanism, thus allowing the elevator shafts to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors. The passenger cabs, which are [[automated guided vehicle]]s or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple elevator shafts are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few \"floors\" of the attraction are open to the outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out from the top of the structure.\n\n===\"Top of the Rock\" elevators===\nGuests ascending to the 67th, 69th, and 70th level observation decks (dubbed \"[[Top of the Rock]]\") atop the [[GE Building]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] ride a high-speed glass-top elevator. When entering the cab, it appears to be any normal elevator ride. However, once the cab begins moving, the interior lights turn off and a special blue light above the cab turns on. This lights the entire shaft, so riders can see the moving cab through its glass ceiling as it rises and lowers through the shaft. Music plays and various animations are also displayed on the ceiling. The entire ride takes about 60 seconds.\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nPart of the [[Haunted Mansion]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], and [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland]] in [[Paris, France]], takes place on an elevator. The \"stretching room\" on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards, giving access to a short tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction. The elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion. Because there is no roof, passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up, which gives the illusion of the room stretching.\n\n===For urban transport===\n[[File:Elevador de Santa Justa.jpg|thumb|[[Elevador de Santa Justa]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn some towns where terrain is difficult to navigate, elevators are used as part of urban transport systems.\n[[File:Elevador Lacerda.jpg|thumb|''Elevador Lacerda'' in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Brazil. ]]\n[[File:Shanklin Cliff Lift.JPG|thumb|Shanklin Cliff elevator in [[Shanklin]], [[Isle of Wight]]]]\n\nExamples:\n* [[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA \u2013 public [[inclined elevator]]s connect to [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington station]]\n* [[Almada]], Portugal \u2013 [[Boca do Vento Elevator]]\n* [[Bad Schandau]], Germany \u2013 [[Bad Schandau Elevator]]\n* [[Barcelona]], Spain \u2013 elevator and cableway line connecting the port terminal to [[Montju\u00efc]] hill\n* [[Bilbao]], Spain \u2013 [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo|Casco Viejo station]] (fare-paying elevator connecting upper and lower neighbourhoods, as well as the station)\n* [[Brussels]], Belgium \u2013 [[Marollen|Marolles]], Belgium: \"Ascenseur des Marolles\", links the upper part of the city to the lower one, from Place Poelaert to Breughel square\n* [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], Switzerland \u2013 [[Hammetschwand Elevator]]\n* [[Chongqing]], China \u2013 public elevator at Kaixuan Road\n* [[Coimbra]], Portugal \u2013 {{ill|Elevador do Mercado|pt}}\n* [[Genoa]], Italy \u2013 eleven public elevators\n* [[Hamburg]], Germany \u2013 [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|Old Elbe Tunnel]] elevators\n* [[Hastings]], UK \u2013 [[East Hill Cliff Railway]]\n* [[Helgoland]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany \u2013 connects upper and lower parts of the island\n* [[Hong Kong]] \u2013 public elevators connecting [[Wah Fu Estate]] to [[Wah Kwai Estate]]\n* [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey \u2013 [[Asans\u00f6r]]\n* [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], USA \u2013 elevator at [[Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail]] station at 9th Street and Palisade Avenue\n* [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator at World's Fair Park\n* [[Lisbon]], Portugal \u2013 ''[[Santa Justa Lift|Elevador de Santa Justa]]'', ''Castelo'' (planned), ''Chiado'' (closed), ''Munic\u00edpio/Biblioteca'' (demolished)\n* [[Luxembourg City]], Luxembourg \u2013 [[Pfaffenthal Panoramic Elevator]]\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator that connects Church Street on the lower level and Court Street on the upper level\n* [[Marburg]], Germany \u2013 some parts of the historic city core built on higher ground (Uppertown, \"Oberstadt\" in German) are accessible from the lower street level by elevators.

Elevators are typically powered by electric motors that drive traction cables and counterweight systems such as a [[hoist (device)|hoist]], although some pump hydraulic fluid to raise a cylindrical piston like a [[hydraulic jack|jack]].\n\nIn agriculture and manufacturing, an elevator is any type of [[conveyor]] device used to lift materials in a continuous stream into bins or [[silo]]s. Several types exist, such as the chain and [[bucket elevator]], grain auger [[screw conveyor]] using the principle of [[Archimedes' screw]], or the chain and paddles or forks of [[hay elevator]]s. Languages other than English may have [[loanword]]s based on either ''elevator'' or ''lift''. Because of wheelchair access laws, elevators are often a legal requirement in new multistory buildings, especially where wheelchair ramps would not be possible.\n\nThere are also some elevators which can go sideways in addition to the usual up-and-down motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.constructionweekonline.com/products-services/169354-germanys-thyssenkrupp-to-launch-revolutionary-rope-free-elevator-in-2022|title=This German company is inventing an elevator that goes sideways|website=Construction Week Online Middle East|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial era===\n[[File:Konrad Kyeser, Bellifortis, Clm 30150, Tafel 09, Blatt 38v (Ausschnitt).jpg|thumb|left|Elevator design by the German engineer [[Konrad Kyeser]] (1405)]]\n\nThe earliest known reference to an elevator is in the works of the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]], who reported that [[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BC \u2013 c. 212 BC) built his first elevator probably in 236 BC.<ref>\"[http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-08-23/home-and-garden/17125291_1_taller-buildings-elevator-elisha-graves-otis Laying the foundation for today's skyscrapers]\".

The invention of a system based on the [[Leadscrew|screw drive]] was perhaps the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, leading to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first screw drive elevator was built by [[Ivan Kulibin]] and installed in the [[Winter Palace]] in 1793, although there may have been an earlier design by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RO5PAAAAMAAJ&q=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&dq=%22words+%22four+screws+lift+this%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjHmq3y1pfoAhVERxUIHUdUAaoQ6AEIKTAA|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, Engineer and Architect|first1=Leonardo da|last1=Vinci|first2=Leonardo (da|last2=Vinci)|first3=Mus\u00e9e des|last3=Beaux-Arts (Montr\u00e9al)|first4=Pierre|last4=Th\u00e9berge|date=10 April 1987|publisher=Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|via=Google Books}}</ref> Several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in the [[Arkhangelskoye Palace|Arkhangelskoye]] near [[Moscow]].\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe development of elevators was led by the need for movement of raw materials including [[coal]] and [[lumber]] from hillsides. The technology developed by these industries and the introduction of steel beam construction worked together to provide the passenger and freight elevators in use today.\n\nStarting in the coal mines, by the mid-19th century elevators were operated with [[steam power]] and were used for moving goods in bulk in mines and factories. These steam driven devices were soon being applied to a diverse set of purposes\u2014in 1823, two [[architect]]s working in [[London]], Burton and Hormer, built and operated a novel tourist attraction, which they called the \"ascending room\". It elevated paying customers to a considerable height in the center of London, allowing them a magnificent panoramic view of downtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |title=Conveyor technology: Elevator |publisher=conveyor-tech.com |access-date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621145810/http://www.conveyor-tech.com/dictionary/catalog/10/index.html |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEarly, crude steam-driven elevators were refined in the ensuing decade; in 1835, an innovative elevator called the \"Teagle\" was developed by the company Frost and Stutt in [[England]]. The elevator was belt-driven and used a [[counterweight]] for extra power.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/estartinventions/a/Elevator.htm |title=Learn Who Invented the Elevator and More |website=Inventors.about.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe hydraulic crane was invented by Sir [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] in 1846, primarily for use at the [[Tyneside]] docks for loading cargo. These quickly supplanted the earlier steam driven elevators: exploiting [[Pascal's law]], they provided a much greater force. A water pump supplied a variable level of [[water pressure]] to a plunger encased inside a vertical cylinder, allowing the level of the platform (carrying a heavy load) to be raised and lowered. Counterweights and balances were also used to increase the lifting power of the apparatus.\n\n[[Henry Waterman]] of New York is credited with inventing the \"standing rope control\" for an elevator in 1850.<ref Name=\"TheElevatorMuseumTimeline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theelevatormuseum.org/timeline.php |title=EW Museum |website=Theelevatormuseum.org |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, the Neapolitan architect [[Gaetano Genovese]] installed in the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] the \"Flying Chair\", an elevator ahead of its time, covered with chestnut wood outside and with maple wood inside. It included a light, two benches and a hand-operated signal, and could be activated from the outside, without any effort on the part of the occupants. Traction was controlled by a motor mechanic utilising a system of toothed wheels. A safety system was designed to take effect if the cords broke. It consisted of a beam pushed outwards by a steel spring.\n\n[[File:Elisha OTIS 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Elisha Otis]] demonstrating his safety system, [[New York Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], 1854]]\n\nIn 1852, [[Elisha Otis]] introduced the safety elevator, which prevented the fall of the cab if the cable broke.

An elevator is essentially a platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a \"cage\", \"carriage\" or \"car\") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a \"hoistway\". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a \"traction\" elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply grooved [[pulley]], commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a [[counterweight]]. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.\n\nThe friction between the ropes and the pulley furnishes the traction which gives this type of elevator its name.\n\nHydraulic elevators use the principles of [[hydraulics]] (in the sense of [[fluid power|hydraulic power]]) to pressurise an above ground or in-ground piston to raise and lower the car (see ''Hydraulic elevators'' below). Roped hydraulics use a combination of both ropes and hydraulic power to raise and lower cars. Recent innovations include permanent magnet motors, machine room-less rail mounted gearless machines, and microprocessor controls.\n\nThe technology used in new installations depends on a variety of factors. Hydraulic elevators are cheaper, but installing cylinders greater than a certain length becomes impractical for very-high lift hoistways. For buildings of much over seven floors, traction elevators must be employed instead. Hydraulic elevators are usually slower than traction elevators.\n\nElevators are a candidate for [[mass customisation]].\nThere are economies to be made from [[mass production]] of the components, but each building comes with its own requirements like different number of floors, dimensions of the well and usage patterns.\n\n===Doors===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nElevator [[doors]] prevent riders from falling into, entering, or tampering with anything in the shaft. The most common configuration is to have two panels that meet in the middle, and slide open laterally. In a cascading telescopic configuration (potentially allowing wider entryways within limited space), the doors roll on independent tracks so that while open, they are tucked behind one another, and while closed, they form cascading layers on one side. This can be configured so that two sets of such cascading doors operate like the center opening doors described above, allowing for a very wide elevator cab. In less expensive installations the elevator can also use one large \"slab\" door: a single panel door the width of the doorway that opens to the left or right laterally. Some buildings have elevators with the single door on the shaftway, and double cascading doors on the cab.\n\n===Machine room-less (MRL) elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Kone EcoDisc.jpg|thumb|Kone EcoDisc. The entire drive system is in the hoistway]]\nMachine room-less elevators are designed so that most of the components fit within the shaft containing the elevator car; and a small cabinet houses the elevator controller. Other than the machinery being in the hoistway, the equipment is similar to a normal traction or hole-less hydraulic elevator. The world's first machine room-less elevator, the Kone MonoSpace was introduced in 1996, by [[Kone]]. The benefits are:\n* creates more usable space\n* use less energy (70\u201380% less than standard hydraulic elevators)\n* uses no oil (assuming it is a traction elevator)\n* all components are above ground similar to roped hydraulic type elevators (this takes away the environmental concern that was created by the [[hydraulic cylinder]] on direct hydraulic type elevators being stored underground)\n* slightly lower cost than other elevators; significantly so for the hydraulic MRL elevator\n* can operate at faster speeds than hydraulics but not normal traction units.\n\n====Detriments====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n* Equipment can be harder, and significantly more dangerous to service and maintain.\n\n====Facts====\n* Noise level is at 50\u201355 dBA ([[A-weighted]] [[decibels]]), which can be lower than some but not all types of elevators.\n* Usually used for [[low-rise]] to mid-rise buildings\n* The motor mechanism is placed in the hoistway itself\n* The US was slow to accept the commercial MRL Elevator because of codes\n* National and local building codes did not address elevators without machine rooms. Residential MRL elevators are still not allowed by the ASME A17 code in the US. MRL elevators have been recognised in the 2005 supplement to the 2004 A17.1 Elevator Code.\n* Today, some machine room-less hydraulic elevators by Otis and ThyssenKrupp exist; they do not involve the use of a piston located underground or a machine room, mitigating environmental concerns; however, code is not yet accepting of them in all parts of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thyssenkruppelevator.com/elevator-products/enduraMRL |title=enduraMRL &#124; thyssenkrupp Elevators Escalators Moving Walks &#124; Installation Service Modernization |website=Thyssenkruppelevator.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otis.com/site/us/Pages/HydroFitProductPage.aspx |title=Hydrofit \u2013 Hydraulic Elevator-Machine-Roomless\u2013Otis Elevator\u2013 USA HydroFitProductPage |website=Otis.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Double-decker elevators===\n{{main|Double-deck elevator}}\nDouble-decker elevators are traction elevators with cars that have an upper and lower deck.

Geared machines use [[worm gear]]s to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by \"rolling\" steel hoist ropes over a drive sheave which is attached to a [[gearbox]] driven by a high-speed motor. These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to {{convert|500|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acelifts.com/news/traction-lifts-work/ |title=Traction Lifts: an infographic on how they work |author=ACE Lifts |work=ACE Lifts}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, AC motors were used for single or double-speed elevator machines on the grounds of cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC [[Motor\u2013generator|motor generator]] were the preferred solution. The [[Motor\u2013generator|MG set]] also typically powered the [[relay logic|relay]] controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.\n\nThe widespread availability of variable frequency AC drives has allowed AC motors to be used universally, bringing with it the advantages of the older motor-generator, DC-based systems, without the penalties in terms of efficiency and complexity. The older MG-based installations are gradually being replaced in older buildings due to their poor energy efficiency.\n\nGearless traction machines are low-speed (low-RPM), high-[[torque]] electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly attached to the end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to {{convert|4000|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external [[drum brake|drum type]] and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see [[inherent safety]] and [[safety engineering]]). But it can also be some form of [[disc brake|disc type]] like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).\n\nIn each case, cables are attached to a hitch plate on top of the cab or may be \"underslung\" below a cab, and then looped over the drive sheave to a [[counterweight]] attached to the opposite end of the cables which reduces the amount of [[power (physics)|power]] needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and is carried along a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerised device that directs starting, [[acceleration]], [[deceleration]] and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40\u201350% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the drive sheave are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. \"[[Traction (engineering)|Traction]]\" is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalisation may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.\n\nElevators with more than {{convert|30|m|0|abbr=on}} of travel have a system called compensation. This is a separate set of cables or a chain attached to the bottom of the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of hoist cable above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight tracks.\n\n===Regenerative drives===\nAnother energy-saving improvement is the regenerative drive,<ref>Debbie Sniderman, [https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/elevators/energy-efficient-elevator-technologies \"Energy Efficient Elevator Technologies\"], American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASME Sept. 2012</ref> which works analogously to [[regenerative braking]] in vehicles, using the elevator's electric motor as a generator to capture some of the gravitational potential energy of descent of a full cab (heavier than its counterweight) or ascent of an empty cab (lighter than its counterweight) and return it to the building's electrical system.\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n[[File:Elevator hydraulic.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pit of a hydraulic scenic elevator with metal grating on bottom. This elevator travels 7 stories.]]\n* ''Conventional hydraulic elevators''. They use an underground [[hydraulic cylinder]], are quite common for low level buildings with two to five floors (sometimes but seldom up to six to eight floors), and have speeds of up to {{convert|200|ft/min|m/s|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. For higher rise applications, a telescopic hydraulic cylinder can be used.{{citation needed|reason=Hydraulic elevators with telescoping shafts are common, especially in 'holeless' or 'reduced depth hole' designs, but if there are any applications above about eight stories, this needs a cite|date=May 2016}}\n* ''Holeless hydraulic elevators'' were developed in the 1970s, and use a pair of above ground cylinders, which makes it practical for environmentally or cost sensitive buildings with two, three, or four floors.\n* ''Roped hydraulic elevators'' use both above ground cylinders and a rope system, allowing the elevator to travel further than the piston has to move.\n\nThe low mechanical complexity of hydraulic elevators in comparison to traction elevators makes them ideal for low rise, low traffic installations. They are less energy efficient as the pump works against gravity to push the car and its passengers upwards; this energy is lost when the car descends on its own weight. The high current draw of the pump when starting up also places higher demands on a building's electrical system. There are also environmental concerns should the lifting cylinder leak fluid into the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/elevator1.htm |title=How Elevators Work: Hydraulic Elevators |author=Harris, Tom |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|date=12 February 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern generation of low-cost, machine room-less traction elevators made possible by advances in [[miniaturisation]] of the traction motor and control systems challenges the supremacy of the hydraulic elevator in their traditional market niche.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Electromagnetic propulsion===\nCable-free elevators using [[electromagnetic propulsion]], capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm [[Thyssen Krupp]] for use in high rise, high density buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=MULTI \u2013 Rope-free elevator system \u2013 thyssenkrupp Elevator|url=https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|website=multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com|publisher=[[Thyssen Krupp]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119034447/https://multi.thyssenkrupp-elevator.com/en/|archive-date=19 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Condliffe|first1=Jamie|title=Meet the world's first cable-free elevator\u2014it can zoom horizontally or vertically|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608167/worlds-first-cable-free-elevator-zooms-horizontally-and-vertically-using-maglev-tech/|website=MIT Technology Review|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=19 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Climbing elevator===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nA climbing elevator is a self-ascending elevator with its own propulsion. The propulsion can be done by an electric or a combustion engine. Climbing elevators are used in guyed masts or towers, in order to make easy access to parts of these constructions, such as flight safety lamps for maintenance. An example would be the [[moonlight tower]]s in Austin, Texas, where the elevator holds only one person and equipment for maintenance. The [[Glasgow Tower]]&nbsp;\u2014 an observation tower in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]&nbsp;\u2014 also makes use of two climbing elevators.  Temporary climbing elevators are commonly used in the construction of new high-rise buildings to move materials and personnel before the building's permanent elevator system is installed, at which point the climbing elevators are dismantled.\n\n===Pneumatic elevator===\nAn elevator of this kind uses a vacuum on top of the cab and a valve on the top of the \"shaft\" to move the cab upwards and closes the valve in order to keep the cab at the same level. A diaphragm or a piston is used as a \"brake\", if there's a sudden increase in pressure above the cab. To go down, it opens the valve so that the air can pressurise the top of the \"shaft\", allowing the cab to go down by its own weight. This also means that in case of a power failure, the cab will automatically go down. The \"shaft\" is made of acrylic, and is always round due to the shape of the vacuum pump turbine. To keep the air inside of the cab, rubber seals are used. Due to technical limitations, these elevators have a low capacity, they usually allow 1\u20133 passengers and up to 525&nbsp;lbs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=Vacuum elevator gives users a gentle lift|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7353-vacuum-elevator-gives-users-a-gentle-lift/|website=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=23 November 2017|date=6 May 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Controls==\n\n===Manual controls===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:OtisControl.jpg|thumb|Otis 1920s controller, operational in a New York City apartment building]]\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by [[elevator operator]]s using a [[rheostat]] connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder.\n\nThe elevator motor was located at the top of the shaft or beside the bottom of the shaft. Pushing the handle forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a [[dead man switch]]: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.\n\nThis lever would allow some control over the energy supplied to the motor and so enabled the elevator to be accurately positioned&nbsp;\u2014 if the operator was sufficiently skilled. More typically, the operator would have to \"jog\" the control, moving the cab in small increments until the elevator was reasonably close to the landing point. Then the operator would direct the outgoing and incoming passengers to \"watch the step\".\n[[File:mit-old-elevator-panel.jpg|thumb|Manual pushbutton elevator controls]]\n\nAutomatic elevators began to appear as early as the 1920s,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} their development being hastened by [[strike action|striking]] elevator operators which brought large cities dependent on skyscrapers (and therefore their elevators) such as New York and Chicago to their knees. Self service elevators were not allowed in New York City until 1922.  Prior to this, non-luxury buildings that could not afford an attendant were built as five-story walk ups.  These electromechanical systems used [[relay logic]] circuits of increasing complexity to control the speed, position and door operation of an elevator or bank of elevators.\n\nThe Otis ''Autotronic'' system of the early 1950s brought the earliest predictive systems which could anticipate traffic patterns within a building to deploy elevator movement in the most efficient manner. Relay-controlled elevator systems remained common until the 1980s and their gradual replacement with solid-state, [[microprocessor]]-based controls are now the industry standard. Most older, manually-operated elevators have been retrofitted with automatic or semi-automatic controls.\n\n[[File:Dover elevator button.jpg|thumb|Typical freight elevator control station]]\n[[File:Dover Impulse at Bob's Furniture - Nashua, NH.jpg|thumb|Typical passenger elevator control station]]\n[[File:Ringing the elevator alarm.jpg|thumb|Using the emergency call button in an elevator.

It may trigger a voice prompt or buzzer alarm. This may also trigger a \"full car\" indicator, indicating the car's inability to accept more passengers until some are unloaded.\n* Electric fans or air conditioning units to enhance circulation and comfort.\n* A control panel with various buttons. In many countries, button text and icons are raised to allow blind users to operate the elevator; many have [[Braille]] text besides. Buttons include:\n** Call buttons to choose a floor. Some of these may be key switches (to control access). In some elevators, certain floors are inaccessible unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode (or both).\n** Door open and door close buttons.\n\nThe operation of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the door closes.

In this case (hastening normal closure), the door close button has no effect. However, the door close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the door close will immediately close the door, for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic door closing in the US is 5 seconds,<ref>ASME A17.1 \u2013 2000, Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, Requirements 4.10.7 \u2013 Door and Signal Timing for Hall Calls, \"The minimum acceptable notification time shall be 5 seconds.\"</ref> which is a noticeable delay if not over-ridden.\n* An alarm button or switch, which passengers can use to warn the premises manager that they have been trapped in the elevator.\n* A set of doors kept locked on each floor to prevent unintentional access into the elevator shaft by the unsuspecting individual. The door is unlocked and opened by a machine sitting on the roof of the car, which also drives the doors that travel with the car. Door controls are provided to close immediately or reopen the doors, although the button to close them immediately is often disabled during normal operations, especially on more recent elevators. Objects in the path of the moving doors will either be detected by sensors or physically activate a switch that reopens the doors. Otherwise, the doors will close after a preset time. Some elevators are configured to remain open at the floor until they are required to move again.  Regulations often require doors to close after use to prevent smoke from entering the elevator shaft in event of fire.\n* Elevators in high traffic buildings often have a \"nudge\" function (the Otis ''Autotronic'' system first introduced this feature){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} which will close the doors at a reduced speed, and sound a buzzer if the \"door open\" button is being deliberately held down, or if the door sensors have been blocked for too long a time.\n* A stop switch (not allowed under British regulations{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}) to halt the elevator while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this will most likely be a [[key switch]].\n\nSome elevators may have one or more of the following:\n* An [[Emergency telephone|elevator telephone]], which can be used (in addition to the alarm) by a trapped passenger to call for help. This may consist of a transceiver, or simply a button.  This feature is often required by local regulations.\n* Hold button: This button delays the door closing timer, useful for loading freight and hospital beds.\n* Call cancellation: A destination floor may be deselected by double clicking.\n* Access restriction by key switches, RFID reader, code keypad, hotel room card, etc.\n* One or more additional sets of doors. This is primarily used to serve different floor plans: on each floor only one set of doors opens. For example, in an elevated crosswalk setup, the front doors may open on the street level, and the rear doors open on the crosswalk level. This is also common in garages, rail stations, and airports. Alternatively, both doors may open on a given floor. This is sometimes timed so that one side opens first for getting off, and then the other side opens for getting on, to improve boarding/exiting speed. This is particularly useful when passengers have luggage or carts, as at an airport, due to reduced manoeuvrability.\n**[[File:Dual elevator door buttons - cropped.jpg|thumb|Dual door open and door close buttons, in an elevator with two sets of doors.]] In case of dual doors, there may be two sets of door open and door close buttons, with one pair controlling the front doors, from the perspective of the console, typically denoted &lt;&gt; and &gt;&lt;, with the other pair controlling the rear doors, typically denoted with a line in the middle, <nowiki>&lt;|&gt; and &gt;|&lt;</nowiki>, or double lines, <nowiki>|&lt;&gt;| and &gt;||&lt;</nowiki>.

Elevator Button Edition |author=Mark Vanhoenacker |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Slate}}</ref>\n\nOther controls, which are generally inaccessible to the public (either because they are [[key switch]]es, or because they are kept behind a locked panel), include:\n* Fireman's service, phase II key switch\n* Switch to enable or disable the elevator.\n* An ''inspector's'' switch, which places the elevator in inspection mode (this may be situated on top of the elevator)\n* Manual up/down controls for elevator technicians, to be used in inspection mode, for example.\n* An ''independent service''/''exclusive mode'' (also known as \"Car Preference\"), which will prevent the car from answering to hall calls and only arrive at floors selected via the panel. The door should stay open while parked on a floor. This mode may be used for temporarily transporting goods.\n* Attendant service mode\n* Large buildings with multiple elevators of this type also had an ''elevator dispatcher'' stationed in the lobby to direct passengers and to signal the operator to leave with the use of a mechanical \"cricket\" noisemaker.\n\n===External controls===\n[[File:External lift control panel.jpg|thumb|An external control panel]]\n\nElevators are typically controlled from the outside by a call box, which has up and down buttons, at each stop. When pressed at a certain floor, the button (also known as a \"hall call\" button) calls the elevator to pick up more passengers. If the particular elevator is currently serving traffic in a certain direction, it will only answer calls in the same direction unless there are no more calls beyond that floor.\n\nIn a group of two or more elevators, the call buttons may be linked to a central dispatch computer, such that they illuminate and cancel together. This is done to ensure that only one car is called at one time.\n\nKey switches may be installed on the ground floor so that the elevator can be remotely switched on or off from the outside.\n\nIn destination control systems, one selects the intended destination floor (in lieu of pressing ''\"up\"'' or ''\"down\"'') and is then notified which elevator will serve their request.\n\n===Floor numbering===\n[[File:Missing Floor 13.jpg|thumb|Elevator buttons showing the missing [[Thirteenth floor|13th floor]]]]\n{{further|Floor numbering}}\n{{empty section|date=March 2020}}\n===Elevator algorithm===\nThe [[elevator algorithm]], a simple [[algorithm]] by which a single elevator can decide where to stop, is summarised as follows:\n* Continue travelling in the same direction while there are remaining requests in that same direction.\n* If there are no further requests in that direction, then stop and become idle, or change direction if there are requests in the opposite direction.\nThe elevator algorithm has found an application in computer [[operating system]]s as an algorithm for scheduling [[hard disk]] requests.\nModern elevators use more complex [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic algorithms]] to decide which request to service next. An introduction to these algorithms can be found in the \"Elevator traffic handbook: theory and practice\" given in the references below.\n\n===Destination control system===\n{{main|Destination dispatch}}\n[[File:Destination control elevator floor selection.jpg|thumb|A destination control elevator floor selection panel at [[Northeastern University]] in Boston, United States]]\nSome skyscraper buildings and other types of installation feature a destination operating panel where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.\n\nIt can also improve accessibility, as a mobility-impaired passenger can move to his or her designated car in advance.\n\nInside the elevator there is no call button to push, or the buttons are there but they cannot be pushed&nbsp;\u2014 except door opening and alarm button&nbsp;\u2014 they only indicate stopping floors.\n\nThe idea of destination control was originally conceived by [[Leo Port]] from Sydney in 1961,<ref>Port, L.W. (1961), Elevator System Commonwealth of Australia Patent Specification, Application Number 1421/61, 14 February 1961</ref> but at that time elevator controllers were implemented in relays and were unable to optimise the performance of destination control allocations.\n\nThe system was first pioneered by [[Schindler Group|Schindler Elevator]] in 1992 as the Miconic 10. Manufacturers of such systems claim that average travelling time can be reduced by up to 30%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.schindler.com/SEC/websecen.nsf/pages/elev-MHR-Mic10-01 |title=Schindler Elevators, Escalators, Moving Walks Service Mod Company |website=Schindler.com |access-date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, performance enhancements cannot be generalised as the benefits and limitations of the system are dependent on many factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peters-research.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=100%3Aunderstanding-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-destination-control&catid=3%3Apapers&Itemid=1 |title=Peters Research Ltd |author=Richard Peters |work=peters-research.com}}</ref> One problem is that the system is subject to gaming. Sometimes, one person enters the destination for a large group of people going to the same floor. The dispatching [[algorithm]] is usually unable to completely cater for the variation, and latecomers may find the elevator they are assigned to is already full. Also, occasionally, one person may press the floor multiple times. This is common with up/down buttons when people believe this to be an effective way to hurry elevators. However, this will make the computer think multiple people are waiting and will allocate empty cars to serve this one person.\n\nTo prevent this problem, in one implementation of destination control, every user is given an [[RFID]] card, for identification and tracking, so that the system knows every user call and can cancel the first call if the passenger decides to travel to another destination, preventing empty calls. The newest invention knows even where people are located and how many on which floor because of their identification, either for the purposes of evacuating the building or for security reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theporttechnology.com/page/systemoperation.html |title=The PORT Technology :: System Operation |work=theporttechnology.com}}</ref> Another way to prevent this issue is to treat everyone travelling from one floor to another as one group and to allocate only one car for that group.\n\nThe same destination scheduling concept can also be applied to public transit such as in [[group rapid transit]].\n[[File:DestinationDispatchElevator.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[destination dispatch]] control station, outside of the car, on which the user presses a button to indicate the desired destination floor, and the panel indicates which car will be dispatched]]\n\n==Special operating modes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Anti-crime protection===\nThe anti-crime protection (ACP) feature will force each car to stop at a pre-defined landing and open its doors. This allows a security guard or a receptionist at the landing to visually inspect the passengers. The car stops at this landing as it passes to serve further demand.\n\n===Up peak===\nDuring up-peak mode (also called moderate incoming traffic), elevator cars in a group are recalled to the lobby to provide expeditious service to passengers arriving at the building, most typically in the morning as people arrive for work or at the conclusion of a lunch-time period when people are going back to work. Elevators are dispatched one-by-one when they reach a pre-determined passenger load, or when they have had their doors opened for a certain period of time. The next elevator to be dispatched usually has its hall lantern or a \"this car leaving next\" sign illuminated to encourage passengers to make maximum use of the available elevator system capacity. Some elevator banks are programmed so that at least one car will always return to the lobby floor and park whenever it becomes free.\n\nThe commencement of up-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the departure of a certain number of fully loaded cars leaving the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Down peak===\nDuring down-peak mode, elevator cars in a group are sent away from the lobby towards the highest floor served, after which they commence running down the floors in response to hall calls placed by passengers wishing to leave the building. This allows the elevator system to provide maximum passenger handling capacity for people leaving the building.\n\nThe commencement of down-peak may be triggered by a time clock, by the arrival of a certain number of fully loaded cars at the lobby within a given time period, or by a switch manually operated by a building attendant.\n\n===Sabbath service===\n[[File:Sabbath on-off.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A switch to turn Sabbath elevator mode on or off]]\n\nIn areas with large populations of observant [[Jew]]s or in facilities catering to Jews, one may find a \"[[Sabbath elevator]]\". In this mode, an elevator will stop automatically at every floor, allowing people to step on and off without having to push any buttons. This prevents violation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] prohibition against operating electrical devices when Sabbath is in effect for those who observe this ritual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/39/Q1/ |title=Shabbat Elevators |work=Ohr Somayach}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Sabbath mode has the side effect of using considerable amounts of energy, running the elevator car sequentially up and down every floor of a building, repeatedly servicing floors where it is not needed. For a tall building with many floors, the car must move on a frequent enough basis so as to not cause undue delay for potential users that will not touch the controls as it opens the doors on every floor up the building.\n\nSome taller buildings may have the Sabbath elevator alternate floors in order to save time and energy; for example, an elevator may stop at only even-numbered floors on the way up, and then the odd-numbered floors on the way down.\n\n===Independent service===\nIndependent service or car preference is a special mode found on most elevators. It is activated by a key switch either inside the elevator itself or on a centralised control panel in the lobby. When an elevator is placed on this mode, it will no longer respond to hall calls. (In a bank of elevators, traffic is rerouted to the other elevators, while in a single elevator, the hall buttons are disabled). The elevator will remain parked on a floor with its doors open until a floor is selected and the door close button is held until the elevator starts to travel. Independent service is useful when transporting large goods or moving groups of people between certain floors.\n\n===Inspection service===\nInspection service is designed to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labelled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB' (short for HoistWay access ENABled). When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be cancelled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or cancelled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.\n\nElevators have a car top inspection station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic in order to move it through the hoistway. Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button. The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.\n\n===Fire service===\nDepending on the location of the elevator, fire service code will vary state to state and country to country. Fire service is usually split up into two modes: phase one and phase two. These are separate modes that the elevator can go into.\n\nPhase one mode is activated by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait an amount of time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator will go to the fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service key switch. The fire-service key switch has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.\n\n[[File:KONE Ecodisc Elevator in Fireman's Mode.jpg|thumb|KONE Ecodisc elevator in fireman's mode]]\n\nPhase-two mode can only be activated by a key switch located inside the elevator on the centralised control panel. This mode was created for firefighters so that they may rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two key switch located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, the firefighter enables the car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and the firefighter can feel the heat and knows not to open the door. The firefighter must hold the door open button until the door is completely opened. If for any reason the firefighter wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the key switch to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If the firefighter wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.\n\n===Medical emergency or code-blue service===\nCommonly found in hospitals, code-blue service allows an elevator to be summoned to any floor for use in an emergency situation. Each floor will have a code-blue recall key switch, and when activated, the elevator system will immediately select the elevator car that can respond the fastest, regardless of direction of travel and passenger load. Passengers inside the elevator will be notified with an alarm and indicator light to exit the elevator when the doors open.\n\nOnce the elevator arrives at the floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of the elevator. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue key switch inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue key switch (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.\n\n===Riot mode===\nIn the event of civil disturbance, insurrection, or rioting, management can prevent elevators from stopping at the lobby or parking areas, preventing undesired persons from using the elevators while still allowing the building tenants to use them within the rest of the building.\n\n===Emergency power operation===\nMany elevator installations now feature emergency power systems such as [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) which allow elevator use in blackout situations and prevent people from becoming trapped in elevators. To be compliant with BS 9999 safety standards, a passenger lift being used in an emergency situation must have a secondary source of power. In many cases, providing a secondary mains feed simply isn't possible, so a UPS and or generator combination is used instead.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\">{{Cite web | url=https://powercontrol.co.uk/blog/ups-emergency-lifts/ |title = Secondary Power Supplies for Emergency Evacuation Lifts}}</ref>\n\nWhere a generator is being used as the secondary power supply in a hospital, a UPS must also be present to meet regulations stating that healthcare facilities must test their emergency generators under load at least once per month. During the test period only one supply of power is feeding the lift, in a blackout situation without a UPS, the lifts would not be operational.<ref name=\"powercontrol.co.uk\"/>\n\n====Traction elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nWhen power is lost in a traction elevator system, all elevators will initially come to a halt. One by one, each car in the group will return to the lobby floor, open its doors, and shut down. People in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly. Once all cars have successfully returned, the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service. The car(s) selected to run under emergency power can be manually over-ridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby. To help prevent entrapment, when the system detects that it is running low on power, it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor, open the doors, and shut down.\n\n====Hydraulic elevators====\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nIn hydraulic elevator systems, emergency power will lower the elevators to the lowest landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, the increasing use of current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as \"soft-start\" contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.\n\n==Modernization==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:G1TOWER view from Art Tower Mito.jpg|thumb|An elevator test tower]]\nMost elevators are built to provide about 30 to 40 years of service, as long as service intervals specified and periodic maintenance/inspections by the manufacturer are followed. As the elevator ages and equipment become increasingly difficult to find or replace, along with code changes and deteriorating ride performance, a complete overhaul of the elevator may be suggested to the building owners.\n\nA typical modernization consists of controller equipment, electrical wiring and buttons, position indicators and direction arrows, hoist machines and motors (including door operators), and sometimes door hanger tracks. Rarely are car slings, rails, or other heavy structures changed. The cost of an elevator modernization can range greatly depending on which type of equipment is to be installed.\n\nModernization can greatly improve operational reliability by replacing mechanical relays and contacts with solid-state electronics. Ride quality can be improved by replacing motor-generator-based drive designs with [[Variable-frequency drive|Variable-Voltage, Variable Frequency (V3F) drives]], providing near-seamless acceleration and deceleration. Passenger safety is also improved by updating systems and equipment to conform to current codes.\n\n==Safety==\n{{See also|List of elevator accidents}}\nOn 26 February 2014, the European union released their adoption of safety standards through a directive notification.<ref>{{Citation|title=Directive 2014/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts and safety components for lifts Text with EEA relevance|date=29 March 2014|url=http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2014/33/oj/eng|volume=OJ L|issue=32014L0033|language=en|access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Cable-borne elevators===\n[[File:Elevator speed governor.jpg|thumb|Governor]]\nStatistically speaking, cable-borne elevators are extremely safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed by any other vehicle system. In 1998, it was estimated that approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, and the vast majority of these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related&nbsp;\u2014 for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts,<ref name=\"windypundit.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.windypundit.com/archives/2008/04/elevator_of_deathnot_really.html |title=Elevator of Death...Or Not \u2013 Windypundit |work=Windypundit|date=16 April 2008 }}</ref> and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> In fact, prior to the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a [[B-25 Empire State Building crash|B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building]] in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant&nbsp;\u2014 the elevator operator.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/04/21/080421fa_fact_paumgarten?currentPage=all |title=Up and Then Down |date=21 April 2008 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/4-elevators-shut-down-by-inspectors-1253339.php |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |first1=Aubrey |last1=Cohen |title=4 Elevators Shut Down By Inspectors |date=23 October 2007}}</ref> This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by [[Elisha Graves Otis]].<ref name=\"newyorker.com\"/> In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the travel height and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact.<ref name=\"windypundit.com\"/> However, in Thailand in November 2012, a woman was killed in a free falling elevator, in what was reported as the \"first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Woman-drops-to-her-death-in-lift-plunge-30194663.html |title=Woman drops to her death in lift plunge |date=20 November 2012 |work=The Nation}}</ref>\n\n===Hydraulic elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nPast problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible [[catastrophic failure]]. The code previously permitted only single-bottom [[hydraulic cylinder]]s. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. Two commercially available are known by the marketing names \"LifeJacket\" and \"HydroBrake\". The plunger gripper is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of [[hydraulic fluid]], thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators, there is risk of leaking [[hydraulic oil]] into the [[aquifer]] and causing potential environmental contamination. This has led to the introduction of [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] liners (casings) around hydraulic cylinders which can be monitored for integrity.\n\nIn the past decade, recent innovations in inverted [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic jacks]] have eliminated the costly process of drilling the ground to install a borehole jack. This also eliminates the threat of corrosion to the system and increases safety.\n\n===Mine-shaft elevators===\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nSafety testing of [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] elevator rails is routinely undertaken. The method involves destructive testing of a segment of the cable. The ends of the segment are frayed, then set in conical [[zinc moulds]]. Each end of the segment is then secured in a large, hydraulic stretching machine. The segment is then placed under increasing load to the point of [[failure]]. Data about elasticity, load, and other factors is compiled and a report is produced. The report is then analysed to determine whether or not the entire rail is safe to use.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:LUP-Interior.JPG|thumb|A [[Fujitec]] traction elevator in Block 192, Bishan, [[Singapore]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n===Passenger service===\nA passenger elevator is designed to move people between a building's floors.\n\nPassenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space.

For example, there is a 3-station underground public elevator in [[Yalta]], [[Ukraine]], which takes passengers from the top of a hill above the Black Sea on which hotels are perched, to a tunnel located on the beach below. At Casco Viejo station in the [[Bilbao Metro]], the elevator that provides access to the station from a hilltop neighbourhood doubles as city transportation: the station's ticket barriers are set up in such a way that passengers can pay to reach the elevator from the entrance in the lower city, or vice versa. See also the [[Elevator#Elevators for urban transport|Elevators for urban transport]] section.\n\n====Types of passenger elevators====\n[[File:World Trade Center Building Design with Floor and Elevator Arrangement.svg|thumb|The former [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s twin towers used [[skylobby|skylobbies]], located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower]]\n\nPassenger elevators may be specialised for the service they perform, including: hospital emergency ([[code blue]]), front and rear entrances, a television in high-rise buildings, [[double-deck elevator|double-decker]], and other uses. Cars may be ornate in their interior appearance, may have audio visual advertising, and may be provided with specialised recorded voice announcements. Elevators may also have [[loudspeakers]] in them to play calm, easy listening music. Such music is often referred to as [[elevator music]].\n\nAn express elevator does not serve all floors. For example, it moves between the ground floor and a [[skylobby]], or it moves from the ground floor or a skylobby to a range of floors, skipping floors in between. These are especially popular in eastern Asia.\n\n====Capacity====\nResidential elevators may be small enough to only accommodate one person while some are large enough for more than a dozen. Wheelchair, or platform elevators, a specialised type of elevator designed to move a [[wheelchair]] {{convert|12|ft|m|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} or less, can often accommodate just one person in a wheelchair at a time with a load of {{convert|750|lb|kg|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety Standard For Platform Lifts and Stairway Chairlifts ASME A18.1\u20132003 |year=2003 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, NY |page=34 (of 69 pages) |edition=2003}} Viewed August 2013.</ref>\n\n===Freight elevators===\n[[File:IllinoisTunnelFirstTrain.jpg|thumb|A specialized elevator from 1905 for lifting [[narrow gauge]] railroad cars between a railroad freight house and the [[Chicago Tunnel Company]] tracks below]]\n[[File:Freight elevator interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of a freight elevator. It is very basic yet rugged for freight loading.]]\n\nA freight elevator, or goods lift, is an elevator designed to carry goods, rather than passengers. Freight elevators are generally required to display a written notice in the car that the use by passengers is prohibited (though not necessarily illegal), though certain freight elevators allow dual use through the use of an inconspicuous riser. In order for an elevator to be legal to carry passengers in some jurisdictions it must have a solid inner door. Freight elevators are typically larger and capable of carrying heavier loads than a passenger elevator, generally from 2,300 to 4,500&nbsp;kg. Freight elevators may have manually operated doors, and often have rugged interior finishes to prevent damage while loading and unloading. Although hydraulic freight elevators exist, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator#Cable-borne_elevators Cable-Borne Elevators], or Traction Elevators are more energy efficient for the work of freight lifting, especially in taller buildings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Sidewalk elevators===\nA '''sidewalk elevator''' is a special type of freight elevator. Sidewalk elevators are used to move materials between a basement and a ground-level area, often the [[sidewalk]] just outside the building. They are controlled via an exterior switch and emerge from a metal trap door at ground level. Sidewalk elevator cars feature a uniquely shaped top that allows this door to open and close automatically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com/sidewalk_p1.html |title=elevatorbob's Elevator Pictures \u2013 Sidewalk Elevators \u2013 Page 1 |author=Bob Desnoyers |work=elevatorbobs-elevator-pics.com}}</ref>\n\n===Stage lifts===\n\n<!-- \"Stage lifts\" links here -->\n'''Stage lifts''' and '''orchestra lifts''' are specialised elevators, typically powered by hydraulics, that are used to raise and lower entire sections of a theatre stage. For example, [[Radio City Music Hall]] has four such elevators: an orchestra lift that covers a large area of the stage, and three smaller lifts near the rear of the stage. In this case, the orchestra lift is powerful enough to raise an entire orchestra, or an entire cast of performers (including live elephants) up to stage level from below. There's a barrel on the background of the image of the left which can be used as a scale to represent the size of the mechanism\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"250px\">\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift1.JPG|The pit beneath the orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall\nRadioCityMusicHallStageLift2.jpg|Orchestra lift at Radio City Music Hall as viewed from beneath the stage\n</gallery>\n\n===Vehicle elevators===\n{{main article|Car elevator}}\nVehicular elevators are used within buildings or areas with limited space (in place of ramps), generally to move [[car]]s into the parking garage or manufacturer's storage. Geared hydraulic chains (not unlike bicycle chains) generate lift for the platform and there are no counterweights. To accommodate building designs and improve accessibility, the platform may rotate so that the driver only has to drive forward. Most vehicle elevators have a weight capacity of 2 tons.\n\nRare examples of extra-heavy elevators for 20-ton [[lorry|lorries]], and even for [[railcar]]s (like one that was used at [[Dnipro (Kiev Metro)|Dnipro Station]] of the [[Kiev Metro]]) also occur.\n\n===Boat lift===\n{{Main|Boat lift}}\n\nIn some smaller canals, boats and small ships can pass between different levels of a canal with a boat elevator rather than through a [[lock (water transport)|canal lock]].\n\n===Aircraft elevators===\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|An [[F/A-18]]C on an aircraft elevator of {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n====For aircraft====\nOn [[aircraft carrier]]s, elevators carry aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar deck for operations or repairs. These elevators are designed for much greater capacity than other elevators, up to {{convert|200000|lb||order=flip|abbr=on}} of aircraft and equipment. Smaller elevators lift munitions to the flight deck from magazines deep inside the ship.\n\n====Within aircraft====\nOn some passenger [[double-deck aircraft]] such as the [[Boeing 747]] or other [[widebody aircraft]], elevators transport flight attendants and food and beverage trolleys from lower deck [[galley (kitchen)|galleys]] to upper passenger carrying decks.<ref name=\"Bowman2014\">{{cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Martin |title=Boeing 747: A History: Delivering the Dream |date=2014 |publisher=Pen and Sword |isbn=978-1-4738-3823-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ej0RBQAAQBAJ|language=en |chapter=5 |quote=This 747, delivered to the Australian carrier in July 1971, was also the first to feature a lower-deck galley, reached by an internal elevator system.}}</ref>\n\n===Limited use and limited application===\nThe limited-use, limited-application (LU/LA) elevator is a special purpose passenger elevator used infrequently, and which is exempt from many commercial regulations and accommodations. For example, a LU/LA is primarily meant to be handicapped accessible, and there might only be room for a single wheelchair and a standing passenger.\n\n===Residential elevator===\n[[File:Visilift Visi-58 Round Residential Elevator.jpg|thumb|A residential elevator with integrated hoistway construction and machine-room-less design]]\n\nA residential elevator or [[home lift]] is often permitted to be of lower cost and complexity than full commercial elevators. They may have unique design characteristics suited for home furnishings, such as hinged wooden shaft-access doors rather than the typical metal sliding doors of commercial elevators. Construction may be less robust than in commercial designs with shorter maintenance periods, but safety systems such as locks on shaft access doors, fall arrestors, and emergency phones must still be present in the event of malfunction.\n\nThe [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) has a specific section of Safety Code (ASME A17.1 Section 5.3) which addresses Residential Elevators. This section allows for different parameters to alleviate design complexity based on the limited use of a residential elevator by a specific user or user group. Section 5.3 of the ASME A17.1 Safety Code is for Private Residence Elevators, which does not include multi-family dwellings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Safety code for elevators and escalators : includes requirements for elevators, escalators, dumbwaiters, moving walks, material elevators, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices |year=2007 |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers |location=New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0791830390 |page=532 |author=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}</ref>\n\nSome types of residential elevators do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator hoistway. This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation. The ASME board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the ASME A17.1 in 2007. Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Elevator Technology: The Machine Room-Less Elevator |url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |work=Architectural Record |publisher=McGraw Hill Financial |access-date=12 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516193821/http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=14&C=220&P=1 |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso, residential elevators are smaller than commercial elevators.

They often connect kitchens to rooms on other floors. They usually do not have the same safety features found in passenger elevators, like various ropes for redundancy. They have a lower capacity, and they can be up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} tall. Control panels at every stop mimic those found in passenger elevators, allowing calling, door control and floor selection.\n\n===Paternoster===\n[[File:BMF Paternoster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[paternoster lift|paternoster]] in [[Berlin]], Germany]]\n{{Main|Paternoster elevator}}\n\nA special type of elevator is the [[paternoster lift|paternoster]], a constantly moving chain of boxes. A similar concept, called the [[belt manlift|manlift]] or [[humanlift]], moves only a small platform, which the rider mounts while using a handhold seen in multi-story industrial plants.\n\n===Scissor lift===\n[[File:Hebebuehne Scissorlift.jpg|right|thumb|A mobile scissor lift, extended to near its highest position]]\n\nThe [[scissor lift]] is yet another type of lift. These are usually mobile work platforms that can be easily moved to where they are needed, but can also be installed where space for counter-weights, machine room and so forth is limited. The mechanism that makes them go up and down is like that of a [[scissor jack]].\n\n===Rack-and-pinion elevator===\n[[Rack-and-pinion]] elevator are powered by a motor driving a pinion gear. Because they can be installed on a building or structure's exterior and there is no machine room or hoistway required, they are the most used type of elevator for buildings under construction (to move materials and tools up and down).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gedausa.com/rack-and-pinion-elevators.html |title=Rack and Pinion Elevators \u2013 Rack and Pinion Lift \u2013 GEDA \u2013 USA |website=Gedausa.com |accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Material handling belts and belt elevators===\nMaterial transport elevators generally consist of an inclined plane on which a conveyor belt runs. The conveyor often includes partitions to ensure that the material moves forward. These elevators are often used in industrial and agricultural applications. When such mechanisms (or spiral screws or pneumatic transport) are used to elevate grain for storage in large vertical silos, the entire structure is called a [[grain elevator]]. Belt elevators are often used in docks for loading loose materials such as coal, iron ore and grain into the holds of [[bulk carrier]]s\n\nThere have occasionally been [[belt manlift|belt lifts]] for humans; these typically have steps about every {{convert|2|m|1|abbr=on}} along the length of the belt, which moves vertically, so that the passenger can stand on one step and hold on to the one above. These belts are sometimes used, for example, to carry the employees of parking garages, but are considered too dangerous for public use.\n\n==Social impact==\nBefore the widespread use of elevators, most residential buildings were limited to about seven stories. The wealthy lived on lower floors, while poorer residents\u2014required to climb many flights of stairs\u2014lived on higher floors. The elevator reversed this social stratification, exemplified by the modern penthouse suite.<ref name=\"Bethune\">{{cite web |last=Bethune |first=Brian |title=How the Elevator Changed Everything |publisher=Maclean's |date=24 March 2014 |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/how-the-elevator-changed-everything-2/}}</ref>\n\nEarly users of elevators sometimes reported nausea caused by abrupt stops while descending, and some users would use stairs to go down. In 1894, a Chicago physician documented \"elevator sickness\".<ref name=\"Bethune\"/>\n\nElevators necessitated new social protocols. When [[Nicholas II of Russia]] visited the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin, his courtiers panicked about who would enter the elevator first, and who would press the buttons. In ''Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator'', author Andreas Bernard documents other social impacts caused by the modern elevator, including thriller movies about stuck elevators, casual encounters and sexual tension on elevators, the reduction of personal space and [[claustrophobia]], and concerns about personal hygiene.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Lift, a Life, Lift-Off: The Bucket on Ropes that Changed the World |work=The Economist|date=15 February 2014 |url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21596491-bucket-ropes-changed-world-lift}}</ref>\n\n==Convenience features==\n[[File:LCD elevator indicator.JPG|thumb|LCD elevator floor indicator]]\n[[File:WaldolfAstoriaElevatorjpg.JPG|thumb|A typical elevator indicator located in the [[Waldorf Astoria New York]]. This elevator was made by Otis.]]\nElevators may feature talking devices as an accessibility aid for the blind. In addition to floor arrival notifications, the computer announces the direction of travel (OTIS is well known for this in some of their GEN2 model elevators), and notifies the passengers before the doors are to close.\n\nIn addition to the call buttons, elevators usually have floor indicators (often illuminated by [[LED]]) and direction lanterns. The former are almost universal in cab interiors with more than two stops and may be found outside the elevators as well on one or more of the floors. Floor indicators can consist of a [[dial (measurement)|dial]] with a rotating [[measuring instrument|needle]], but the most common types are those with successively illuminated floor indications or [[liquid crystal display|LCDs]]. Likewise, a change of floors or an arrival at a floor is indicated by a sound, depending on the elevator.\n\nDirection lanterns are also found both inside and outside elevator cars, but they should always be visible from outside because their primary purpose is to help people decide whether or not to get on the elevator. If somebody waiting for the elevator wants to go up, but a car comes first that indicates that it is going down, then the person may decide not to get on the elevator. If the person waits, then one will still stop going up. Direction indicators are sometimes etched with arrows or shaped like arrows and/or use the convention that one that lights up red means \"down\" and green (or white) means \"up\". Since the colour convention is often undermined or over-ridden by systems that do not invoke it, it is usually used only in conjunction with other differentiating factors. An example of a place whose elevators use only the colour convention to differentiate between directions is the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Chicago, where a single circle can be made to light up green for \"up\" and red for \"down\". Sometimes directions must be inferred by the position of the indicators relative to one another.\n\nIn addition to lanterns, most elevators have a chime to indicate if the elevator is going up or down either before or after the doors open, usually in conjunction with the lanterns lighting up. For example, one chime can indicate \"up\", two \"down\", and no chimes indicate an elevator that is 'free'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.access-board.gov/attachments/article/1350/adaag.pdf#page=40|title=Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities|author=<!-- not applicable -->|at=Section 4.10.4 Hall Lanterns (p. 37)|publisher=[[United States Access Board|U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board)]]|access-date=13 April 2019|quote=A visible and audible signal shall be provided at each hoistway entrance to indicate which car is answering a call.

It stabilises the condition of the air inside the elevator car. Some elevator air conditioners can be used in countries with cold climates if a thermostat is used to reverse the refrigeration cycle to warm the elevator car.\n\nHeat generated from the cooling process is dissipated into the hoistway. The elevator cab (or car) is ordinarily not air-tight, and some of this heat may reenter the car and reduce the overall cooling effect.\n\nThe air from the lobby constantly leaks into the elevator shaft due to elevator movements as well as elevator shaft ventilation requirements. Using this conditioned air in the elevator does not increase energy costs. However, by using an independent elevator air conditioner to achieve better temperature control inside the car, more energy will be used.\n\nAir conditioning poses a problem to elevators because of the condensation that occurs. The condensed water produced has to be disposed of; otherwise, it would create flooding in the elevator car and hoistway.\n\n====Methods of removing condensed water====\nThere are at least four ways to remove condensed water from the air conditioner. However, each solution has its pros and cons.\n\n====Atomizing====\nAtomizing, also known as misting the condensed water, is one way to dispose of the condensed water. Spraying ultra-fine water droplets onto the hot coils of the air conditioner ensures that the condensed water evaporates quickly.\n\nThough this is one of the best methods to dispose of the condensed water, it is also one of the costliest because the nozzle that atomises the water easily gets choked. The majority of the cost goes to maintaining the entire atomising system.\n\n====Boiling====\nDisposing of condensed water works by firstly collecting the condensed water and then heating it to above boiling point. The condensed water is eventually evaporated, thereby disposing of it.\n\nConsumers are reluctant to employ this system because of the high rate of energy used just to dispose of this water.\n\n====Cascading====\nThe cascading method works by flowing the condensed water directly onto the hot coils of the air conditioner. This eventually evaporates the condensed water.\n\nThe downside of this technology is that the coils have to be at extremely high temperature for the condensed water to be evaporated. There is a chance that the water might not evaporate entirely and that would cause water to overflow onto the exterior of the car.\n\n====Drainage system====\nDrainage system works by creating a sump to collect the condensed water and using a pump to dispose of it through a drainage system.\n\nIt is an efficient method, but it comes at a heavy price because the cost of building the sump. Moreover, maintaining the pump to make sure it operates is very expensive. Furthermore, the pipes used for drainage would look ugly on the exterior.

Passenger elevators are tested using the ASME A17.2 Standard. The frequency of these tests is mandated by the local jurisdiction, which may be a town, city, state or provincial standard.\n\nPassenger elevators must also conform to many ancillary building codes including the Local or State building code, [[National Fire Protection Association]] standards for Electrical, Fire Sprinklers and Fire Alarms, Plumbing codes, and [[HVAC]] codes. Also, passenger elevators are required to conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act and other State and Federal civil rights legislation regarding accessibility.\n\nResidential elevators are required to conform to ASME A17.1. Platform and Wheelchair elevators are required to comply with ASME A18.1 in most US jurisdictions.\n\nMost elevators have a location in which the permit for the building owner to operate the elevator is displayed. While some jurisdictions require the permit to be displayed in the elevator cab, other jurisdictions allow for the operating permit to be kept on file elsewhere \u2013 such as the maintenance office \u2013 and to be made available for inspection on demand. In such cases instead of the permit being displayed in the elevator cab, often a notice is posted in its place informing riders of where the actual permits are kept.\n\n==Unique installations==\n\n===World statistics===\n{{Self-contradictory|about=the number of elevators installed|date=December 2017|talksection=World_Statistics}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n!

Even though the shaft runs diagonally upwards with the contour of the tower, both the upper and lower cars remain horizontally level. The offset distance of the two cars changes throughout the journey.\n\nThere are four elevator cars of the traditional design that run from the second level to the third level. The cars are connected to their opposite pairs (opposite in the elevator landing/hall) and use each other as the [[counterweight]]. As one car ascends from level 2, the other descends from level 3. The operations of these elevators are synchronised by a light signal in the car.\n\n=== Statue of Unity ===\n[[File:Statue of Unity in 2018 (cropped).jpg|alt=Statue of Unity, Gujarat, India|thumb|[[Statue of Unity|Statue of Unity, Gujarat, India]]]]\nThe [[Statue of Unity]], the world's tallest statue at {{convert|182|m|ft}} high, has 10 high speed ({{convert|4|m/s|ft/s}}) elevators leading up to a viewing gallery {{convert|153|m|ft}} high.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/marketing/otis-to-give-a-lift-to-the-top-of-the-statue-of-unity/66630400|title=Otis to give a 'lift' to the top of the Statue of Unity \u2013 ET BrandEquity|last=www.ETBrandEquity.com|website=ETBrandEquity.com|language=en|access-date=18 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Taipei 101===\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317101\u7684\u5347\u964d\u6a5f.JPG|left|thumb|The observation deck elevator floor indicator in the Taipei 101]]\n\nDouble deck elevators, installed by [[Toshiba]] using [[Kone]] EcoDisc machinery,{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} are used in the [[Taipei 101]] office tower. Tenants of even-numbered floors first take an escalator (or an elevator from the parking garage) to the 2nd level, where they will enter the upper deck and arrive at their floors. The lower deck is turned off during low-volume hours, and the upper deck can act as a single-level elevator stopping at all adjacent floors. For example, the 85th floor restaurants can be accessed from the 60th floor sky-lobby. Restaurant customers must clear their reservations at the reception counter on the 2nd floor. A bank of express elevators stop only on the sky lobby levels (36 and 60, upper-deck car), where tenants can transfer to \"local\" elevators.\n\nThe high-speed observation deck elevators accelerate to a world-record certified speed of {{convert|1010|m/min|km/h|0}} in 16 seconds, and then it slows down for arrival with subtle air pressure sensations. The door opens after 37 seconds from the 5th floor. Special features include aerodynamic car and counterweights, and cabin pressure control to help passengers adapt smoothly to pressure changes. The downwards journey is completed at a reduced speed of 600 meters per minute, with the doors opening at the 52nd second.\n\n===Gateway Arch===\n[[File:Gateway Arch tram car.JPG|thumb|The interior of one of the Gateway Arch tramway cars]]\n{{Main|Gateway Arch}}\n\nThe Gateway Arch in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States, has a unique [[Montgomery Elevator|Montgomery]] elevator system which carries passengers from the visitors' center underneath the Arch to the observation deck at the top of the structure.\n\nCalled a ''tram'' or ''tramway'', people enter this unique [[tram]]way much as one would enter an ordinary elevator, through double doors. Passing through the doors the passengers in small groups enter a horizontal cylindrical compartment containing seats on each side and a flat floor. A number of these compartments are linked to form a train. These compartments each individually retain an appropriate level orientation by tilting while the entire train follows curved tracks up one leg of the arch.\n\nThere are two tramways within the Arch, one at the north end, and the other at the south end. The entry doors have windows, so people travelling within the Arch are able to see the interior structure of the Arch during the ride to and from the observation deck. At the beginning of the trip the cars hang from the drive cables, but as the angle of the shaft changes, they end up beside and then on top of the cables.\n\n[[File:ElevatorShaftHannoverNewCityHallLookingUp.jpg|thumb|left|View up the shaft of the elevator at the New City Hall, [[Hanover]], Germany]]\n\n===New City Hall, Hanover, Germany===\n[[File:ElevatorHannoverNewCityHallSketch.png|thumb|100px|Elevator in the new city hall, Hanover, Germany, showing the cabin at the bottom and the top]]\n\nThe elevator in the [[New City Hall (Hanover)|New City Hall]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], is a technical rarity, and unique in Europe, as the elevator starts straight up but\nthen changes its angle by 15 degrees to follow the contour of the dome of the hall. The cabin therefore tilts 15 degrees during the ride. The elevator travels a height of 43 meters. The new city hall was built in 1913. The elevator was destroyed in 1943 and rebuilt in 1954.\n\n===Luxor incline elevator===\nThe [[Luxor Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], United States, has [[inclined elevator]]s. The shape of this casino is a [[pyramid]]. Therefore, the elevator travels up the side of the pyramid at a 39-degree angle. Other locations with inclined elevators include the [[Cityplace (DART station)|Cityplace Station]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], the [[Huntington (WMATA station)|Huntington Metro Station]] in [[Huntington, Virginia]], and the [[San Diego Convention Center]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\n===Germany===\nAt the Radisson Blue in Berlin, Germany, the main elevator is surrounded by an aquarium; 82 feet tall, the aquarium contains more than a thousand different fish and offers views to people using the elevator.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://au.totaltravel.yahoo.com/galleries/g/29194655/now-thats-a-lot-of-water/29194656/#1 |title=Hotel lobby goes under the sea |website=Au.totaltravel.yahoo.com |date=6 August 2015 |access-date=26 April 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror===\n{{Main|The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror}}\n\nThe Twilight Zone Tower of Terror is the common name for a series of elevator attractions at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] park in Orlando, the [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in Paris and the [[Tokyo DisneySea]] park in Tokyo. The central element of this attraction is a simulated free-fall achieved through the use of a high-speed elevator system. For safety reasons, passengers are seated and secured in their seats rather than standing. Unlike most traction elevators, the elevator car and [[counterweight]] are joined using a rail system in a continuous loop running through both the top and the bottom of the drop shaft. This allows the drive motor to pull down on the elevator car from underneath, resulting in downward acceleration greater than that of normal gravity. The high-speed drive motor is used to rapidly lift the elevator as well.\n\nThe passenger cabs are mechanically separated from the lift mechanism, thus allowing the elevator shafts to be used continuously while passengers board and embark from the cabs, as well as move through show scenes on various floors. The passenger cabs, which are [[automated guided vehicle]]s or AGVs, move into the vertical motion shaft and lock themselves in before the elevator starts moving vertically. Multiple elevator shafts are used to further improve passenger throughput. The doorways of the top few \"floors\" of the attraction are open to the outdoor environment, thus allowing passengers to look out from the top of the structure.\n\n===\"Top of the Rock\" elevators===\nGuests ascending to the 67th, 69th, and 70th level observation decks (dubbed \"[[Top of the Rock]]\") atop the [[GE Building]] at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] ride a high-speed glass-top elevator. When entering the cab, it appears to be any normal elevator ride. However, once the cab begins moving, the interior lights turn off and a special blue light above the cab turns on. This lights the entire shaft, so riders can see the moving cab through its glass ceiling as it rises and lowers through the shaft. Music plays and various animations are also displayed on the ceiling. The entire ride takes about 60 seconds.\n\n===The Haunted Mansion===\nPart of the [[Haunted Mansion]] attraction at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], and [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland]] in [[Paris, France]], takes place on an elevator. The \"stretching room\" on the ride is actually an elevator that travels downwards, giving access to a short tunnel which leads to the rest of the attraction. The elevator has no ceiling and its shaft is decorated to look like walls of a mansion. Because there is no roof, passengers are able to see the walls of the shaft by looking up, which gives the illusion of the room stretching.\n\n===For urban transport===\n[[File:Elevador de Santa Justa.jpg|thumb|[[Elevador de Santa Justa]], in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn some towns where terrain is difficult to navigate, elevators are used as part of urban transport systems.\n[[File:Elevador Lacerda.jpg|thumb|''Elevador Lacerda'' in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Brazil. ]]\n[[File:Shanklin Cliff Lift.JPG|thumb|Shanklin Cliff elevator in [[Shanklin]], [[Isle of Wight]]]]\n\nExamples:\n* [[Alexandria, Virginia]], USA \u2013 public [[inclined elevator]]s connect to [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington station]]\n* [[Almada]], Portugal \u2013 [[Boca do Vento Elevator]]\n* [[Bad Schandau]], Germany \u2013 [[Bad Schandau Elevator]]\n* [[Barcelona]], Spain \u2013 elevator and cableway line connecting the port terminal to [[Montju\u00efc]] hill\n* [[Bilbao]], Spain \u2013 [[Zazpikaleak/Casco Viejo|Casco Viejo station]] (fare-paying elevator connecting upper and lower neighbourhoods, as well as the station)\n* [[Brussels]], Belgium \u2013 [[Marollen|Marolles]], Belgium: \"Ascenseur des Marolles\", links the upper part of the city to the lower one, from Place Poelaert to Breughel square\n* [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], Switzerland \u2013 [[Hammetschwand Elevator]]\n* [[Chongqing]], China \u2013 public elevator at Kaixuan Road\n* [[Coimbra]], Portugal \u2013 {{ill|Elevador do Mercado|pt}}\n* [[Genoa]], Italy \u2013 eleven public elevators\n* [[Hamburg]], Germany \u2013 [[Elbe Tunnel (1911)|Old Elbe Tunnel]] elevators\n* [[Hastings]], UK \u2013 [[East Hill Cliff Railway]]\n* [[Helgoland]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], Germany \u2013 connects upper and lower parts of the island\n* [[Hong Kong]] \u2013 public elevators connecting [[Wah Fu Estate]] to [[Wah Kwai Estate]]\n* [[\u0130zmir]], Turkey \u2013 [[Asans\u00f6r]]\n* [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], USA \u2013 elevator at [[Hudson\u2013Bergen Light Rail]] station at 9th Street and Palisade Avenue\n* [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator at World's Fair Park\n* [[Lisbon]], Portugal \u2013 ''[[Santa Justa Lift|Elevador de Santa Justa]]'', ''Castelo'' (planned), ''Chiado'' (closed), ''Munic\u00edpio/Biblioteca'' (demolished)\n* [[Luxembourg City]], Luxembourg \u2013 [[Pfaffenthal Panoramic Elevator]]\n* [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], USA \u2013 outdoor public elevator that connects Church Street on the lower level and Court Street on the upper level\n* [[Marburg]], Germany \u2013 some parts of the historic city core built on higher ground (Uppertown, \"Oberstadt\" in German) are accessible from the lower street level by elevators.

Moreover, \u201c[[Chapter V (Trey Songz album)#Track listing|Check Me Out]]\u201d effortlessly combines Trey\u2019s rap flow and melodic skills, in extension to \u201c[[Dive In (Trey Songz song)|Dive In]]\u201d which is considered to be his most signature-sounding record that uses suave wordplay to compare his pending conquest of a woman's body to taking a dive in the pool.
