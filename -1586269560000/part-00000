The film stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as an Israeli [[Mossad]] agent who runs a covert operation that helps Ethiopian-Jewish refugees escape to safe haven in Israel. [[Michael K. Williams|Michael Kenneth Williams]], [[Haley Bennett]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Michiel Huisman]], [[Chris Chalk]], [[Greg Kinnear]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] are in supporting roles.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the events of [[Operation Brothers|Operation Moses]] and [[Operation Joshua]] in 1984-1985, in which the Mossad covertly evacuated [[Beta Israel|Jewish Ethiopian]] refugees to [[Israel]] using a base at the once-abandoned holiday resort of '''Arous Village''' on the [[Red Sea]] coast of  [[Sudan]].\n\n''The Red Sea Diving Resort'' premiered at the [[San Francisco Jewish Film Festival]] on July 28, 2019, and was released on July 31, 2019, by [[Netflix]]. Critical reaction to the film was predominantly negative.\n\n==Plot==\nKabede Bimro, an [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jew]], works with the [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Mossad]] agent Ari Levinson to evacuate Jewish-Ethiopian refugees to Israel. Ari realizes that his ability to operate in Ethiopia would be improved if he had a cover activity that would give him a reason for having a building and vehicles. He proposes to Israeli intelligence officer Ethan Levin a plan that would allow him to evacuate significantly more refugees: rent the Red Sea Diving Resort, an abandoned Sudanese coastal hotel, and run it as a [[Front organization|front]] to facilitate moving refugees out of the country. The unorthodox plan is reluctantly approved, and Ari recruits his former Mossad colleagues Rachel Reiter, Jake Wolf, Max Rose, and Sammy Navon, to assist him.\n\nShortly after the team's arrival in the Islamic country of Sudan, the brochures they had printed inspire actual tourists to begin arriving at the resort. Although hosting guests was not originally part of the plan, Levinson realizes the tourists will provide cover for the team's operations, so the team runs the resort as a legitimate business while simultaneously evacuating refugees to a waiting Israeli ship off the coast. The plan is initially successful, and multiple extraction operations are carried out, but the [[Sudan|Sudanese]] Colonel Abdel Ahmed learns of Bimro after interrogating and then killing a group of refugees. Ahmed visits the resort to investigate but does not discover the refugee operation.\n\nOne night, Ari and Sammy are arrested after an evacuation mission narrowly escapes from Sudanese soldiers. They are released and return to the resort to find Levin awaiting them; he tells the group the mission has been compromised and that it is canceled.\n\nAhmed again visits the resort, and Rachel is forced to kill one of his men after the soldier discovers a group of refugees hiding there. To evacuate them, Ari decides to perform a final refugee extraction by cargo plane with assistance from Walton Bowen, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer. Ari and his team transport the refugees to an abandoned British airfield. The team and Bimro narrowly escape Ahmed and extract themselves and the refugees.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Ari Levinson\n* [[Michael K.

The first interest was shown by [[German Empire|Imperial German]] banks and companies, already involved in the building of the [[Baghdad Railway|Berlin-Baghdad railway]], followed by British interests. In 1911, in an attempt to bring together competing British and German interests in the region, a British company known as African and Eastern Concession Ltd, was formed.<ref name=IPC-B-CS-04>{{cite book|last=J.

A rising demand for petroleum during the war had demonstrated to the big powers the importance of having their own sources of oil. Since one of the original partners of TPC had been [[Germany|German]], the [[France|French]] demanded this share as the spoils of war. This was agreed by the [[San Remo Oil Agreement]], much to the annoyance of the Americans who felt excluded from Middle Eastern oil and demanded an \"open door\".<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/> After prolonged and sometimes sharp diplomatic exchanges, U.S. oil companies were permitted to buy into the TPC, but it would take several years until the negotiations were completed.\n\n===Oil found in 1927===\n[[File:Baba Gurgur.jpg|thumb|Kirkuk district: an oil gusher spouting with a stream of oil in foreground.]]TPC obtained a concession to explore for oil in 1925, in return for a promise that the Iraqi government would receive a royalty for every ton of oil extracted, but linked to the oil companies' profits and not payable for the first 20 years. The concession required the company to select 24 rectangular plots of {{convert|8|sqmi|km2}} each for drilling operations. During the 1925/6 season, an international geological party, comprising representatives of the shareholding companies together with an American contingent, conducted a wide-ranging survey of Iraq. Two wells were selected for drilling at Pulkanah and one each at Khashm al Ahmar, Injanah and Qaiyarah. Kirkuk was included as the sixth location. The well at [[Baba Gurgur]] was located by geologist J.M. Muir just north of [[Kirkuk]]. Drilling started, and in the early hours of 14 October 1927 oil was struck. Many tons of oil were spilled before the gushing well was brought under control, and the oil field soon proved to be extensive.<ref name=MQ/><ref>\"Discovery of the Kirkuk Field\", ''IPC Newsletter'', Issue 96, October 1997.</ref>\n\n===Red Line Agreement and the creation of IPC===\nThe discovery hastened the negotiations over the composition of TPC, and on 31 July 1928 the shareholders signed a formal partnership agreement to include the Near East Development Corporation (NEDC), an American [[consortium]] of five large US oil companies that included [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], [[Standard Oil Company of New York]] (Socony), [[Gulf Oil]], the [[Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company]], and [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield Co.]]. Shares were held in the following proportions: 23.75% each to the [[BP|Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Royal Dutch/Shell, the [[Total S.A.|''Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles'']] (''CFP''), and the NEDC; the remaining 5% went to Calouste Gulbenkian.<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/> TPC was to be organized as a nonprofit company, registered in Britain, that produced crude oil for a fee for its parent companies, based on their shares. The company itself was only allowed to refine and sell to Iraq's internal market, in order to prevent any competition with the parent companies.<ref name=NG/>\n\nThe agreement, known as [[Red Line Agreement]] after a red line was drawn around the former boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted, \"[T]he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co\u2011operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East\". The Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free. During the period, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where [[ARAMCO]] (formed in 1944 by renaming of the Saudi subsidiary of [[Standard Oil of California]] (Socal)) and [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]] (BAPCO) respectively held controlling position.<ref name=SH>\n{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=Oil in the Middle East|author=Stephen Hemsley Longrigg|date=1961|oclc=237163|ol=5830191M}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-671-50248-4|location=New York|title=The Prize|url=https://archive.org/details/prize00dani|author=Daniel Yergin|edition=The prize|date=1991|id=0671502484}}\n</ref>\n\nThe San Remo conference had stipulated that Iraqis should be allowed 20% of the company if they wanted to invest in it, but the existing shareholders successfully resisted Iraqi efforts to participate, despite pressure by the British government to accept Iraqi shareholders.\n\nIn 1929 the TPC was renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company.<ref name=SH/> By 1934, the NEDC comprised only two shareholders, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony, which had merged with the [[Vacuum Oil Company]] to form [[Mobil|Socony-Vacuum]] in 1931.<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/><ref>{{cite news |title=Business & Finance: Socony-Vacuum Corp. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882045,00.html |work=Time Magazine, 1931 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |date=1931-08-10}}</ref>\n\n===Delayed production start===\n[[File:Pipeline work.jpg|right|thumb|IPC assistants welding pipes together on the Esdraelon stretch in the 1930s.]]The original concession of March 14, 1925 covered all of Iraq, but IPC was reluctant to develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the [[Great Depression]], the world was awash with oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.<ref>Blair, John M., ''The Control of Oil'' (New York, 1977), pp. 80\u201390</ref>\n\nThe owners of IPC had conflicting interests: the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch/Shell and Standard Oil had access to major sources of crude oil outside Iraq, and therefore wanted to hold the Iraqi concessions in reserve, whilst CFP and the other companies pushed for rapid development of Iraqi oil as they had limited crude oil supplies. These competing interests delayed the development of the Iraqi fields, and IPC's concession eventually expired because the companies failed to meet certain performance requirements, such as the construction of pipelines and shipping terminals. The concession was renegotiated in 1931, however, giving the company a 70-year concession on an enlarged {{convert|83,200|km2|sqmi}} area east of the [[Tigris River]]. In return, the Iraqi government demanded, and received, additional payments and loans, as well as the promise that IPC would complete two oil pipelines to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] by 1935\u2014something CFP had demanded for a long time, in order to get its share of the oil quickly to France.<ref name= PL>Fitzgerald, Edward Peter, \"Business diplomacy: Walter Teagle, Jersey Standard, and the Anglo-French pipeline conflict in the Middle East, 1930\u20131931\", ''Business History Review'', Summer 1993 vol. 67 no. 2 p. 207(39)</ref>\n\n[[File:IPC oil tanks at Haifa.jpg|right|thumb|IPC oil tanks at Haifa.]]Different routes and terminal locations on the Mediterranean coast were sought by the French, who favored a northern route through [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] terminating at the city of [[Tripoli (city, Lebanon)|Tripoli]] on the Lebanese coast, and the British and the Iraqis who preferred a southern route, terminating at [[Haifa]], in what then was [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The issue was settled by a compromise which provided for the construction of two pipelines, each with a throughput capacity of 2,000,000 tons a year. The length of the Northern line would be {{convert|532|mi|km}}, that of the Southern line ([[Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline]]) {{convert|620|mi|km}}.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=PduotC73nh0C |page=164 |title= }} ''The History of the British Petroleum Company''], pp. 164\u2013165</ref> In 1934, the pipelines were completed from Kirkuk to [[Haditha|Al Hadithah]], and from there, to both Tripoli and Haifa; the Kirkuk field was brought online the same year. Only in 1938, nine years after the discovery, did IPC begin to export oil in significant quantities.<ref name=PL/>\n\nThe Kirkuk production averaged 4 million tons per year until [[World War II]], when restricted shipping in the Mediterranean forced down the production sharply. Although the Iraq Government tried to open up the country to competition, the company taking up the new concession was bought out by IPC and, under the name of the Mosul Petroleum Company, was duly gathered into the IPC 'family' of associated companies (see below). The company also got the concession rights to southern Iraq in 1938, and founded the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC) as their wholly owned subsidiary to develop the southern region of Iraq.<ref name=SH/>\n\n===IPC partner disputes===\nThree issues caused protracted negotiations among the partner groups of IPC:\n[[File:IraqWWII en.svg|right|thumb|Iraq in 1945]]\n* Revision of the Anglo-Iranian royalty: when the Iraq concession of 1925 was revised in March 1931, and IPC was granted a blanket concession over {{convert|32,000|sqmi|km2}} of territory east of the Tigris River, the question arose as to whether Anglo-Persian's 10 percent royalty should be extended to include the new area. After lengthy negotiations the groups arrived at a compromise settlement in November 1934, which stipulated that D'Arcy Exploration (Anglo-Iranian) would be entitled to a 7.5-percent royalty on such oil as was produced from the {{convert|32,000|sqmi|km2}} covered by the revised Iraq concession, the oil to be delivered free of cost at the field, with IPC paying the royalty due the Iraq Government.<ref name=YP>The International Petroleum Cartel, Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission, released through Subcommittee on Monopoly of Select Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, 83d Cong., 2nd sess (Washington, DC, 1952), Chapter 4, \"Joint Control Through Common Ownership--The Iraq Petroleum Co., Ltd.,\" pp. 47\u2013112.[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/Petroleum/ftc5.htm]</ref>\n* Tax matters: since IPC was a British-chartered company, the British groups would not have been subject to double taxation. The non-British groups, however, did not relish the idea of having the earnings of IPC taxed once by the British Government and again by their own governments. Eventually the groups agreed to transfer all pipeline operations to IPC, and price crude to the groups on the basis of management's estimate of British income tax cost plus 1 shilling profit per ton. Under this plan IPC's profits were nominal and its tax liability to the British Government was relatively small.<ref name=YP/>\n* Demise of the Red Line Agreement{{anchor|Demise of the Red Line Agreement}}: two of the American oil companies in IPC were offered a partnership with [[ARAMCO]] to develop the oil resources of Saudi Arabia. Their partners in IPC refused to release them from the Red Line Agreement. After the Americans claimed that World War II had ended the Agreement, protracted legal proceedings with Gulbenkian followed.<ref>[[Daniel Yergin]], ''The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power'', New York, 1991, pp. 413\u201319</ref> Eventually the case was settled out of court and the American partners joined ARAMCO.<ref>\"Oil: Share the Wealth\u201d, ''Time'', 23 December 1946</ref> The French Government and Gulbenkian had withdrawn their objections in exchange for a greater share of IPC's output, and the Red Line agreement boundaries were redrawn to exclude Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and the western-half of Jordan.<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/>\n\n===IPC Group operations outside Iraq===\n[[File:IPC Organisation Chart (2).png|thumb|The corporate organisation of the Iraq Petroleum Company and its associated companies, 1 January 1950.]]As the Red Line Agreement defined the company's sphere of operations well beyond the boundaries of Iraq, IPC's shareholders were keen to look for oil elsewhere in the Middle East. They created associated companies, one for each territory to be explored. These companies were collectively known as \"The IPC Group\". They would obtain from the sovereign power an exploration licence covering simple exploration over a defined geographical area, or a concession permitting exploration and the production of oil. By 1948, the Company had created 12 companies with concessions or exploration licences: Petroleum Development (Cyprus Ltd), Lebanon Petroleum Company Ltd, Petroleum Development (Palestine) Ltd, Syrian Petroleum Company Ltd, Trans-Jordan Petroleum Company Ltd, Mosul Petroleum Company Ltd, Basrah Petroleum Company Ltd, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd, Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd, Petroleum Concessions Ltd (for the Aden Protectorates), Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Ltd.<ref name=IPC>Iraq Petroleum Handbook, published 1948, pp. 142\u20133.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, IPC joined negotiations for an oil concession in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] province, Saudi Arabia, bidding against [[Standard Oil of California]] (SOCAL, later renamed Chevron). Represented by [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg]], the company's bid failed when it offered payment in [[History of the Rupee#Other issues|rupees]] rather than the gold that King Abdul-Aziz (also known as [[Ibn Saud]]) desired.<ref>H. St. J. Philby, ''Arabian Oil Adventures'', The Middle East Institute, 1964, pp. 73\u2013134.</ref> SOCAL gained the concession and, joined by the Texas Oil Company in 1936, went on to discover oil at [[Dammam]] through its subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company (Casoc) in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Oil Companies in the Gulf Region|url=http://www.virginia.edu/igpr/APAG/apagoilhistory.html|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref> Thereafter, IPC concentrated its efforts in Arabia in developing its Qatar oil concession (oil discovered 1939), Abu Dhabi (oil discovered in 1959), Oman (see [[Petroleum Development Oman]]) and the Aden Protectorates (in today's [[Yemen]]).

The principal competitors for concessions were British Oil Development Co. Ltd.(BOD), and SOCAL. When BOD became interested in concessions in northern Iraq, IPC eventually bought them out. So successful were its efforts that by the end of 1944 IPC was operating in over {{convert|467,055|sqmi|km2}} of territory, an area larger in size than the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana combined. In addition, IPC attempted, though without success, to extend further its area of operations by seeking concessions or exploration permits in Turkey and in the neutral zones of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.<ref name=YP/>\n\nIn 1937, IPC signed an oil concession agreement with the Sultan of Muscat that would cover the entire region of the Sultanate.

The company created air transport companies, the Iraq Petroleum Transport Company and Transports du Proche Orient, to operate aircraft and vessels to ferry people and equipment to the remoter parts of its concession areas.<ref>\"The International Petroleum Cartel\", Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission, released through Subcommittee on Monopoly of Select Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, 83d Cong., 2nd sess (Washington, DC, 1952), Chapter 4, \"Joint Control Through Common Ownership--The Iraq Petroleum Co., Ltd.,\" pp. 47\u2013</ref>\n\n===IPC-Government relations===\n\nDuring the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Monarchy (1932\u201358)]], there were no serious issues between the IPC and the Iraqi government as the [[Hashemite]]s were extremely pro-west. In fact, they had been installed by the British, and therefore tensions were minimized. They were dependent on the British militarily and had essentially pledged allegiance to them through the [[Baghdad Pact]]. The Hashemites' main disputes centered on increasing the amount of crude oil extracted, getting more Iraqis involved in the process of producing the oil and getting more royalties. In 1952, terms that were more generous to the Iraqi government were negotiated. These terms were largely based on the far more lucrative terms of the [[Saudi Aramco#History|Saudi-Aramco \"50/50\" agreement of December 1950]]. One could argue that a determinant in these negotiations was the friendly atmosphere in which they were conducted.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Saul |first=Samir |title=Masterly Inactivity as Brinkmanship: The Iraq Petroleum Company's Route to Nationalization, 1958\u20131972 |journal=The International History Review |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=746\u2013792 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2007.9641140 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:King Faisal II of Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Faisal II of Iraq|King Faisal II of Iraq]] who was assassinated in 1958.]]This atmosphere did not continue to the negotiations held between the IPC and revolutionary governments that followed the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy in 1958. Relations between the two can be examined on two major factors. First, oil was a vital part of the Iraqi economy. Because of this, the IPC had a huge impact on the amount of revenue that the government generated and thus had a certain amount of influence over the government. The second major factor was inability of the Iraqi government at that time to source the technical knowledge and skill necessary to take over oil operations in the country.<ref name=MB>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |title=The Nationalization of the Iraqi Petroleum Company |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=107\u2013124 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800053356 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Monthly Review Press |isbn=0-85345-335-7 |ol=5047249M |location=New York |title=Middle East oil and the energy crisis |first=Joe |last=Stork |date=1975 }}</ref>\n\n===The Qasim era===\n\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2014}}\n\n[[File:Karim01 small.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Abd al-Karim Qasim: 1st Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, in office 14 July 1958 \u2013 8 February 1963.]]Beginning in the early 1950s, as the strength of nationalism in Iraq grew, the focus came to bear on foreign control over the oil production of the country. [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] was a nationalist Iraqi Army general who seized power in a 1958 coup d'\u00e9tat in which the Iraqi monarchy was eliminated. He ruled the country as Prime Minister of Iraq until his downfall and death in 1963. Before the coup, he used the fact that the IPC was producing oil for western nations rather than for the benefit of Iraq citizens as one of his main points of contention with the Iraqi government. Once in power, he was critical of several aspects of the IPC. First, he was critical of the monetary arrangement between the IPC and the government. He also did not appreciate the monopoly that the IPC had been granted.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-3615-2|title=The Modern History of Iraq|url=https://archive.org/details/modernhistoryofi00marr|author=Marr, Phebe.|date=August 2003|id=0813336155}}</ref>\n\nHowever the economic situation at the time did not permit Qasim to nationalize the IPC \u2013 western nations had boycotted Iranian oil when Mossadeq nationalized its oil company and could be expected to do the same in this case. (It is likely that nationalization would have been Qasim's favored route had he had the necessary capabilities). Further, Iraqis lacked the technical and managerial capabilities to run the IPC. Qasim needed the oil revenues to run his government and to keep the military satisfied. Therefore, Qasim resorted to many other tactics including increasing transit rates at Basra by 1,200%. In response, the IPC stopped producing oil that used Basra as a shipping point. The ensuing confrontation was the lowest point in relations between the two up to this point.<ref name=MB/>\n\nOn 12 December 1961, the Iraqi government enacted Law No. 80, which expropriated 99.5 per cent of the IPC group's concession areas without compensation and put an immediate stop on oil exploration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=The Third River: Aspects of Oil in the Middle East 1887-1979|date=2014|publisher=National Archives|location=United Arab Emirates|isbn=978-9948-05-146-6|page=331|edition=First|url=http://www.greenmountainpress.co.uk/iraq_petroleum_the_third_river.html|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance of the Iraqi government. Whereas it had been more willing to accommodate the IPC in 1952, the government's positions under Qasim were largely non-negotiable. However this should not be surprising because it was expected that Qasim would take advantage of growing Arab nationalism and a sense amongst many ordinary Iraqis that they were being exploited by the west.<ref name=MB/>\n\n===1972 nationalization===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the Iraqi government criticized the IPC and used the IPC as a central piece of their anti-western propaganda. The Soviet-Iraqi agreement of 1969 emboldened the Iraqi government and in 1970 they made a list of demands including ownership of 20% of the company's assets and more control. The IPC by this time was taking the Iraqi government very seriously and made some huge concessions. They agreed to increase oil production substantially and also increase the price of its crude oil in certain areas. They also offered an advance payment on royalties.<ref name=MB/>\n\nHowever this was not enough for the Iraqi government and they issued a new set of demands in November 1970 which essentially involved more Iraqi control of operations and more Iraqi profit-taking. Dissatisfied with the IPC's unwillingness to negotiate on Iraq's terms, the Iraqi government gave the IPC an ultimatum with similar demands in May 1972. The IPC tried to offer a compromise solution but the Ba'athist government rejected the offer and, on June 1, 1972, nationalized IPC operations, which were taken over by the Iraq National Oil Company.<ref name=MB/>\n\nThe Kirkuk field still forms the basis for northern Iraqi oil production.

The first interest was shown by [[German Empire|Imperial German]] banks and companies, already involved in the building of the [[Baghdad Railway|Berlin-Baghdad railway]], followed by British interests. In 1911, in an attempt to bring together competing British and German interests in the region, a British company known as African and Eastern Concession Ltd, was formed.<ref name=IPC-B-CS-04>{{cite book|last=J.

A rising demand for petroleum during the war had demonstrated to the big powers the importance of having their own sources of oil. Since one of the original partners of TPC had been [[Germany|German]], the [[France|French]] demanded this share as the spoils of war. This was agreed by the [[San Remo Oil Agreement]], much to the annoyance of the Americans who felt excluded from Middle Eastern oil and demanded an \"open door\".<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/> After prolonged and sometimes sharp diplomatic exchanges, U.S. oil companies were permitted to buy into the TPC, but it would take several years until the negotiations were completed.\n\n===Oil found in 1927===\n[[File:Baba Gurgur.jpg|thumb|Kirkuk district: an oil gusher spouting with a stream of oil in foreground.]]TPC obtained a concession to explore for oil in 1925, in return for a promise that the Iraqi government would receive a royalty for every ton of oil extracted, but linked to the oil companies' profits and not payable for the first 20 years. The concession required the company to select 24 rectangular plots of {{convert|8|sqmi|km2}} each for drilling operations. During the 1925/6 season, an international geological party, comprising representatives of the shareholding companies together with an American contingent, conducted a wide-ranging survey of Iraq. Two wells were selected for drilling at Pulkanah and one each at Khashm al Ahmar, Injanah and Qaiyarah. Kirkuk was included as the sixth location. The well at [[Baba Gurgur]] was located by geologist J.M. Muir just north of [[Kirkuk]]. Drilling started, and in the early hours of 14 October 1927 oil was struck. Many tons of oil were spilled before the gushing well was brought under control, and the oil field soon proved to be extensive.<ref name=MQ/><ref>\"Discovery of the Kirkuk Field\", ''IPC Newsletter'', Issue 96, October 1997.</ref>\n\n===Red Line Agreement and the creation of IPC===\nThe discovery hastened the negotiations over the composition of TPC, and on 31 July 1928 the shareholders signed a formal partnership agreement to include the Near East Development Corporation (NEDC), an American [[consortium]] of five large US oil companies that included [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], [[Standard Oil Company of New York]] (Socony), [[Gulf Oil]], the [[Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company]], and [[ARCO|Atlantic Richfield Co.]]. Shares were held in the following proportions: 23.75% each to the [[BP|Anglo-Persian Oil Company]], Royal Dutch/Shell, the [[Total S.A.|''Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles'']] (''CFP''), and the NEDC; the remaining 5% went to Calouste Gulbenkian.<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/> TPC was to be organized as a nonprofit company, registered in Britain, that produced crude oil for a fee for its parent companies, based on their shares. The company itself was only allowed to refine and sell to Iraq's internal market, in order to prevent any competition with the parent companies.<ref name=NG/>\n\nThe agreement, known as [[Red Line Agreement]] after a red line was drawn around the former boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted, \"[T]he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co\u2011operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East\". The Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free. During the period, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where [[ARAMCO]] (formed in 1944 by renaming of the Saudi subsidiary of [[Standard Oil of California]] (Socal)) and [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]] (BAPCO) respectively held controlling position.<ref name=SH>\n{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=Oil in the Middle East|author=Stephen Hemsley Longrigg|date=1961|oclc=237163|ol=5830191M}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=0-671-50248-4|location=New York|title=The Prize|url=https://archive.org/details/prize00dani|author=Daniel Yergin|edition=The prize|date=1991|id=0671502484}}\n</ref>\n\nThe San Remo conference had stipulated that Iraqis should be allowed 20% of the company if they wanted to invest in it, but the existing shareholders successfully resisted Iraqi efforts to participate, despite pressure by the British government to accept Iraqi shareholders.\n\nIn 1929 the TPC was renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company.<ref name=SH/> By 1934, the NEDC comprised only two shareholders, Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony, which had merged with the [[Vacuum Oil Company]] to form [[Mobil|Socony-Vacuum]] in 1931.<ref name=GT-DEX-1920-78/><ref>{{cite news |title=Business & Finance: Socony-Vacuum Corp. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882045,00.html |work=Time Magazine, 1931 |accessdate=2012-08-20 |date=1931-08-10}}</ref>\n\n===Delayed production start===\n[[File:Pipeline work.jpg|right|thumb|IPC assistants welding pipes together on the Esdraelon stretch in the 1930s.]]The original concession of March 14, 1925 covered all of Iraq, but IPC was reluctant to develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the [[Great Depression]], the world was awash with oil and greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.<ref>Blair, John M., ''The Control of Oil'' (New York, 1977), pp. 80\u201390</ref>\n\nThe owners of IPC had conflicting interests: the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch/Shell and Standard Oil had access to major sources of crude oil outside Iraq, and therefore wanted to hold the Iraqi concessions in reserve, whilst CFP and the other companies pushed for rapid development of Iraqi oil as they had limited crude oil supplies. These competing interests delayed the development of the Iraqi fields, and IPC's concession eventually expired because the companies failed to meet certain performance requirements, such as the construction of pipelines and shipping terminals. The concession was renegotiated in 1931, however, giving the company a 70-year concession on an enlarged {{convert|83,200|km2|sqmi}} area east of the [[Tigris River]]. In return, the Iraqi government demanded, and received, additional payments and loans, as well as the promise that IPC would complete two oil pipelines to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] by 1935\u2014something CFP had demanded for a long time, in order to get its share of the oil quickly to France.<ref name= PL>Fitzgerald, Edward Peter, \"Business diplomacy: Walter Teagle, Jersey Standard, and the Anglo-French pipeline conflict in the Middle East, 1930\u20131931\", ''Business History Review'', Summer 1993 vol. 67 no. 2 p. 207(39)</ref>\n\n[[File:IPC oil tanks at Haifa.jpg|right|thumb|IPC oil tanks at Haifa.]]Different routes and terminal locations on the Mediterranean coast were sought by the French, who favored a northern route through [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] terminating at the city of [[Tripoli (city, Lebanon)|Tripoli]] on the Lebanese coast, and the British and the Iraqis who preferred a southern route, terminating at [[Haifa]], in what then was [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. The issue was settled by a compromise which provided for the construction of two pipelines, each with a throughput capacity of 2,000,000 tons a year. The length of the Northern line would be {{convert|532|mi|km}}, that of the Southern line ([[Mosul-Haifa oil pipeline]]) {{convert|620|mi|km}}.<ref>[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=PduotC73nh0C |page=164 |title= }} ''The History of the British Petroleum Company''], pp. 164\u2013165</ref> In 1934, the pipelines were completed from Kirkuk to [[Haditha|Al Hadithah]], and from there, to both Tripoli and Haifa; the Kirkuk field was brought online the same year. Only in 1938, nine years after the discovery, did IPC begin to export oil in significant quantities.<ref name=PL/>\n\nThe Kirkuk production averaged 4 million tons per year until [[World War II]], when restricted shipping in the Mediterranean forced down the production sharply. Although the Iraq Government tried to open up the country to competition, the company taking up the new concession was bought out by IPC and, under the name of the Mosul Petroleum Company, was duly gathered into the IPC 'family' of associated companies (see below). The company also got the concession rights to southern Iraq in 1938, and founded the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC) as their wholly owned subsidiary to develop the southern region of Iraq.<ref name=SH/>\n\n===IPC partner disputes===\nThree issues caused protracted negotiations among the partner groups of IPC:\n[[File:IraqWWII en.svg|right|thumb|Iraq in 1945]]\n* Revision of the Anglo-Iranian royalty: when the Iraq concession of 1925 was revised in March 1931, and IPC was granted a blanket concession over {{convert|32,000|sqmi|km2}} of territory east of the Tigris River, the question arose as to whether Anglo-Persian's 10 percent royalty should be extended to include the new area. After lengthy negotiations the groups arrived at a compromise settlement in November 1934, which stipulated that D'Arcy Exploration (Anglo-Iranian) would be entitled to a 7.5-percent royalty on such oil as was produced from the {{convert|32,000|sqmi|km2}} covered by the revised Iraq concession, the oil to be delivered free of cost at the field, with IPC paying the royalty due the Iraq Government.<ref name=YP>The International Petroleum Cartel, Staff Report to the Federal Trade Commission, released through Subcommittee on Monopoly of Select Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, 83d Cong., 2nd sess (Washington, DC, 1952), Chapter 4, \"Joint Control Through Common Ownership--The Iraq Petroleum Co., Ltd.,\" pp. 47\u2013112.[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/Petroleum/ftc5.htm]</ref>\n* Tax matters: since IPC was a British-chartered company, the British groups would not have been subject to double taxation. The non-British groups, however, did not relish the idea of having the earnings of IPC taxed once by the British Government and again by their own governments. Eventually the groups agreed to transfer all pipeline operations to IPC, and price crude to the groups on the basis of management's estimate of British income tax cost plus 1 shilling profit per ton. Under this plan IPC's profits were nominal and its tax liability to the British Government was relatively small.<ref name=YP/>\n* Demise of the Red Line Agreement{{anchor|Demise of the Red Line Agreement}}: two of the American oil companies in IPC were offered a partnership with [[ARAMCO]] to develop the oil resources of Saudi Arabia.

They created associated companies, one for each territory to be explored. These companies were collectively known as \"The IPC Group\". They would obtain from the sovereign power an exploration licence covering simple exploration over a defined geographical area, or a concession permitting exploration and the production of oil. By 1948, the Company had created 12 companies with concessions or exploration licences: Petroleum Development (Cyprus Ltd), Lebanon Petroleum Company Ltd, Petroleum Development (Palestine) Ltd, Syrian Petroleum Company Ltd, Trans-Jordan Petroleum Company Ltd, Mosul Petroleum Company Ltd, Basrah Petroleum Company Ltd, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd, Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Ltd, Petroleum Concessions Ltd (for the Aden Protectorates), Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Ltd.<ref name=IPC>Iraq Petroleum Handbook, published 1948, pp. 142\u20133.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, IPC joined negotiations for an oil concession in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Hasa]] province, Saudi Arabia, bidding against [[Standard Oil of California]] (SOCAL, later renamed Chevron).

The principal competitors for concessions were British Oil Development Co. Ltd.(BOD), and SOCAL. When BOD became interested in concessions in northern Iraq, IPC eventually bought them out. So successful were its efforts that by the end of 1944 IPC was operating in over {{convert|467,055|sqmi|km2}} of territory, an area larger in size than the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana combined.

In fact, they had been installed by the British, and therefore tensions were minimized. They were dependent on the British militarily and had essentially pledged allegiance to them through the [[Baghdad Pact]]. The Hashemites' main disputes centered on increasing the amount of crude oil extracted, getting more Iraqis involved in the process of producing the oil and getting more royalties. In 1952, terms that were more generous to the Iraqi government were negotiated. These terms were largely based on the far more lucrative terms of the [[Saudi Aramco#History|Saudi-Aramco \"50/50\" agreement of December 1950]]. One could argue that a determinant in these negotiations was the friendly atmosphere in which they were conducted.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Saul |first=Samir |title=Masterly Inactivity as Brinkmanship: The Iraq Petroleum Company's Route to Nationalization, 1958\u20131972 |journal=The International History Review |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=746\u2013792 |doi=10.1080/07075332.2007.9641140 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:King Faisal II of Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Faisal II of Iraq|King Faisal II of Iraq]] who was assassinated in 1958.]]This atmosphere did not continue to the negotiations held between the IPC and revolutionary governments that followed the overthrow of the Hashemite monarchy in 1958. Relations between the two can be examined on two major factors. First, oil was a vital part of the Iraqi economy. Because of this, the IPC had a huge impact on the amount of revenue that the government generated and thus had a certain amount of influence over the government. The second major factor was inability of the Iraqi government at that time to source the technical knowledge and skill necessary to take over oil operations in the country.<ref name=MB>{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |title=The Nationalization of the Iraqi Petroleum Company |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=107\u2013124 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800053356 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Monthly Review Press |isbn=0-85345-335-7 |ol=5047249M |location=New York |title=Middle East oil and the energy crisis |first=Joe |last=Stork |date=1975 }}</ref>\n\n===The Qasim era===\n\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2014}}\n\n[[File:Karim01 small.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Abd al-Karim Qasim: 1st Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, in office 14 July 1958 \u2013 8 February 1963.]]Beginning in the early 1950s, as the strength of nationalism in Iraq grew, the focus came to bear on foreign control over the oil production of the country. [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] was a nationalist Iraqi Army general who seized power in a 1958 coup d'\u00e9tat in which the Iraqi monarchy was eliminated. He ruled the country as Prime Minister of Iraq until his downfall and death in 1963. Before the coup, he used the fact that the IPC was producing oil for western nations rather than for the benefit of Iraq citizens as one of his main points of contention with the Iraqi government. Once in power, he was critical of several aspects of the IPC. First, he was critical of the monetary arrangement between the IPC and the government. He also did not appreciate the monopoly that the IPC had been granted.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-3615-2|title=The Modern History of Iraq|url=https://archive.org/details/modernhistoryofi00marr|author=Marr, Phebe.|date=August 2003|id=0813336155}}</ref>\n\nHowever the economic situation at the time did not permit Qasim to nationalize the IPC \u2013 western nations had boycotted Iranian oil when Mossadeq nationalized its oil company and could be expected to do the same in this case. (It is likely that nationalization would have been Qasim's favored route had he had the necessary capabilities). Further, Iraqis lacked the technical and managerial capabilities to run the IPC. Qasim needed the oil revenues to run his government and to keep the military satisfied. Therefore, Qasim resorted to many other tactics including increasing transit rates at Basra by 1,200%. In response, the IPC stopped producing oil that used Basra as a shipping point. The ensuing confrontation was the lowest point in relations between the two up to this point.<ref name=MB/>\n\nOn 12 December 1961, the Iraqi government enacted Law No. 80, which expropriated 99.5 per cent of the IPC group\u2019s concession areas without compensation and put an immediate stop on oil exploration.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=The Third River: Aspects of Oil in the Middle East 1887-1979|date=2014|publisher=National Archives|location=United Arab Emirates|isbn=978-9948-05-146-6|page=331|edition=First|url=http://www.greenmountainpress.co.uk/iraq_petroleum_the_third_river.html|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance of the Iraqi government. Whereas it had been more willing to accommodate the IPC in 1952, the government's positions under Qasim were largely non-negotiable. However this should not be surprising because it was expected that Qasim would take advantage of growing Arab nationalism and a sense amongst many ordinary Iraqis that they were being exploited by the west.<ref name=MB/>\n\n===1972 nationalization===\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2014}}\n{{Unbalanced section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the Iraqi government criticized the IPC and used the IPC as a central piece of their anti-western propaganda. The Soviet-Iraqi agreement of 1969 emboldened the Iraqi government and in 1970 they made a list of demands including ownership of 20% of the company's assets and more control. The IPC by this time was taking the Iraqi government very seriously and made some huge concessions. They agreed to increase oil production substantially and also increase the price of its crude oil in certain areas. They also offered an advance payment on royalties.<ref name=MB/>\n\nHowever this was not enough for the Iraqi government and they issued a new set of demands in November 1970 which essentially involved more Iraqi control of operations and more Iraqi profit-taking. Dissatisfied with the IPC's unwillingness to negotiate on Iraq's terms, the Iraqi government gave the IPC an ultimatum with similar demands in May 1972. The IPC tried to offer a compromise solution but the Ba'athist government rejected the offer and, on June 1, 1972, nationalized IPC operations, which were taken over by the Iraq National Oil Company.<ref name=MB/>\n\nThe Kirkuk field still forms the basis for northern Iraqi oil production. Kirkuk has over 10 billion barrels (1.6&nbsp;km\u00b3) of remaining proven [[oil reserves]].{{When|date=September 2016}}{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Jambur, Bai Hassan, and Khabbaz fields are the only other currently producing oil fields in northern Iraq. While Iraq's northern oil industry remained relatively unscathed during the Iran-Iraq War, an estimated 60% of the facilities in southern and central Iraq were damaged in the [[Gulf War]]. Post-1991 fighting between Kurdish and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq resulted in temporary sabotage of the Kirkuk field's facilities. In 1996, production capacity in northern and central Iraq was estimated at between 0.7 and 1 million barrels (110,000 to 160,000 m\u00b3) per day, down from around 1.2 million barrels (190,000 m\u00b3) per day before the Gulf War.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/resources/mearr/num1/ancient_modern.ashx |title=\"Ancient and Modern\", ''Middle East Reservoir review'' |access-date=2011-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102836/http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/resources/mearr/num1/ancient_modern.ashx |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==IPC today==\nIPC has ceased operations, but the company \"Iraq Petroleum Company\" still remains [[Extant taxon|extant]] as a name on paper,<ref name=\"cc\"/> and one of its surviving associated companies \u2013 [[Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company]] (ADPC), formerly Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd \u2013 continued with the original shareholding intact until January 2014.<ref name=GT-DEX-2012-100>{{cite web|title=The shareholders of ADPC info from ExxonMobil history|url=http://www.exxonmobil.com/MENA-English/PA/about_who_history.aspx|accessdate=18 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307220208/http://www.exxonmobil.com/MENA-English/PA/about_who_history.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref name=GT-DEX-2012-101>{{cite web|title=Bloomberg Businessweek company info - ADPC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=47870320|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=GT-DEX-2012-102>{{cite web|title=Upstream Opportunities for New Entrants|url=http://www.pillsburylaw.com/siteFiles/Publications/Newsletter20120630MiddleEastEnergyOilGasAbuDhabiOilGasUpdate.pdf|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=GT-DEX-2012-104>{{cite web|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/article/The_Abu_Dhabi_Oil_Discoveries/a3b23f12.aspx|title=GEO ExPro - The Abu Dhabi Oil Discoveries|publisher=}}</ref> ADPC still holds 40% of the onshore concession in Abu Dhabi, with the majority 60% held by the [[Abu Dhabi National Oil Company]] (ADNOC) on behalf of the Abu Dhabi Government.

The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.\n* '''''Still Hunt''''' is a bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843\u20131907), installed in the park in 1883. Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb \"Cat Hill\" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a stone base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his sculpture directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.\n\n===Artists===\n* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].\n* Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at East 96th/97th Street, the statue of [[Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | title=Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen}}</ref> was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.\n\n===Fictional characters===\n[[File:Alice in Wonderland Central Park NYC.JPG|right|thumb]]\n* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a [[giant]] [[mushroom]] reaching toward a [[pocket watch]] held by the [[White Rabbit]]. Peering over her shoulder is the [[Cheshire Cat]], flanked on one side by the [[Dormouse]], and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[Jos\u00e9 de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, \"The Jabberwocky\" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:\n''<center>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe</center>''\n:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.\n* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.\n\n===Historical figures===\n[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Central Park)|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'']]\n[[File:Christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|Statue of Christopher Columbus]]]]\n* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the Bol\u00edvar Hotel, once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.\n* In 1892, the '''[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|statue of Christopher Columbus]]''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Su\u00f1ol]] in 1892,<ref>The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze \"J.

While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th\u2013107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926\u20131927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.\n\n===Writers and poets===\n[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]\n* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\".

It was unveiled in Central Park, New York in 1880. It was intended as a companion statue to '''''[[Statue of Walter Scott (New York City)|Sir Walter Scott]]''''' by the same sculptor, erected some eight years previously.\n* '''''[[Statue of Fitz-Greene Halleck|Fitz-Greene Halleck]]''''' has been described as the ''least known literary figure today on Literary Walk'', despite being the only person to have a memorial unveiled by the then-[[president of the United States]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877, ten years after his death in November 1867. The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.\n* '''''[[Statue of William Shakespeare (New York City)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] sculpted the work. Ward was arguably the dean of American sculpture at the time, and he is the source of more public sculpture in NYC than any other artist. This is the artist's second of four works in Central Park.\n\n===Other sculptures===\n* ''The Angel of the Waters'' / '''[[Bethesda Fountain]]''' (unveiled in 1873) was not in the original \"Greensward Plan\", developed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]; the architectural middle of the park was called \"The Water Terrace\", for its placement beside The Lake, but the area became known as Bethesda Terrace after the fountain was unveiled in 1873. At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called\u2026 Bethesda\u2026whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. <!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--> It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it. The fountain can be found in the middle of the park, on the north side of 72nd Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* '''''[[Indian Hunter (Ward)|Indian Hunter]]''''' (1866) by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]<ref>Signed in the bronze \"J.Q.A.

Most have been donated by individuals or organizations, few by the city itself. While many early statues are of authors and poets along \"Literary Walk\" and American figures like [[Daniel Webster]] and \"the Pilgrim\", other early works were simply picturesque, like ''The Hunter'' and ''The Falconer''; other notable statues include the [[statue of Balto]], an Egyptian [[obelisk]] called the \"[[Cleopatra's Needle (New York City)|Cleopatra's Needle]]\", [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice of Wonderland]], and [[Duke Ellington Memorial]].\n\n==Selected sculptures==\n\n===Animals===\n[[File:Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|''Balto'']]\n[[File:\"Still Hunt\" 4.jpg|thumb|''Still Hunt'']]\n* '''''[[Statue of Balto|Balto]]''''' was dedicated to the sled dogs that led several dogsled teams through a snow-storm in the winter of 1925 in order to deliver [[medicine]] that would stop a [[diphtheria]] epidemic in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Alaska]]. The sculpture is slightly larger than the real-life dog, and is placed on a rock outcropping on the main path leading north from the Tisch Children's Zoo. The sculpture was created by [[Frederick George Richard Roth]], and placed in the park in 1925. Like so many other [[monument]]s in the park, it's made of [[bronze]], and it was donated to the park by the Balto Monument Committee to the City of [[New York City|New York]].  Under the [[sculpture]], a small plaque can be found, containing the following inscription:\n:<center>''Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxins six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the Winter of 1925.

It is made of bronze, and was cast in Paris, France in 1850 and was placed in the park in 1863. The sculpture was donated by [[Gordon Webster Burnham]], who also donated the statue of [[Daniel Webster]], as well as statues in other cities.  The monument depicts a goat, wedged accidentally between two rocks, which is about to be devoured by two [[eagle]]s. Their talons are sunk into the back of the goat as they flap their wings in victory.\n* '''''Still Hunt''''' is a bronze sculpture of a crouching [[cougar]] waiting to pounce by sculptor [[Edward Kemeys]] (1843\u20131907), installed in the park in 1883. Situated on a rock outcrop on the west side of the East Drive at the edge of the Ramble, the crouching animal has scared many joggers as they climb \"Cat Hill\" (formally Cedar Hill) and approach this life-size and realistic representation. Unlike the traditional sculptures of other animals in the park that sit on a stone base or pedestal, Kemeys situated his sculpture directly on the rock ledge. Kemeys was so interested in depicting his animals in a realistic mode that he traveled to the western states to see them in their native habitat.\n\n===Artists===\n* Bust of the architect '''''[[Richard Morris Hunt]]''''' at the Hunt Memorial, along with two other figures sculpted by [[Daniel Chester French]]. Flanking the Hunt bust are statuettes, one holding a sculptor's mallet and a palette, representing the allied arts, while the other holds a model for the Administration Building at the [[Chicago]] [[World's Columbian Exposition]], designed by Hunt. On the perimeter wall of Central Park, Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, opposite the [[Frick Collection]], which was built on the site of the [[New York Public Library|Lenox Library]], also designed by architect Hunt. The granite and marble Hunt memorial was designed by American architect [[Bruce Price]].\n* Tucked into a dead end triangle of Central Park at East 96th/97th Street, the statue of [[Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/albert-bertel-thorvaldsen.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | title=Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen}}</ref> was first dedicated in 1894 and is the only statue of an artist displayed in any New York City park.\n\n===Fictional characters===\n[[File:Alice in Wonderland Central Park NYC.JPG|right|thumb]]\n* One large sculpture depicts '''''[[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]''''', from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 classic ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. The statue is located on [[East 74th Street]] on the north side of Central Park's Conservatory Water. Alice is pictured sitting on a [[giant]] [[mushroom]] reaching toward a [[pocket watch]] held by the [[White Rabbit]]. Peering over her shoulder is the [[Cheshire Cat]], flanked on one side by the [[Dormouse]], and on the other by [[Mad Hatter]], who in contrast to the calm Alice looks ready to laugh out loud at any moment.  Publisher and philanthropist [[George T. Delacorte Jr.]] ordered the sculpture from [[Jos\u00e9 de Creeft]], in honor of Delacorte's late wife, Margarita, and to the enjoyment of the children of [[New York City|New York]]. Unveiled in 1959, de Creeft's sculpture tries to follow [[John Tenniel]]'s whimsical [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] illustrations from the first edition of the book. According to various sources, Alice is said to look like de Creeft's daughter Donna. The Alice in Wonderland project's architects and designers were Hideo Sasaki and Fernando Texidor, who inserted some plaques with inscriptions from the book in the terrace around the sculpture. Margarita's favorite poem, \"The Jabberwocky\" is also included; chiseled in a granite circle surrounding the sculpture:\n''<center>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe</center>''\n:The design of the sculpture attracts many children who want to climb its many levels, resulting in the bronze's glowing patina, polished by thousands of tiny hands over the years since the sculpture was unveiled.  It was cast at Modern Art Foundry Astoria Queens NY. The sculpture was in the music video of Slick Ricks Children's Story.\n* The '''[[Burnett Memorial Fountain]]''', dedicated to the author [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]], was placed in the [[Conservatory Garden]] when it reopened in 1936, a donation by the ad hoc Children's Garden Building Committee. It was designed and created by [[Bessie Potter Vonnoh]] between 1926 and 1936. When Frances Hodgson Burnett died in 1924, some of her friends wanted to honor her memory by creating a storytelling area in Central Park. They chose the Conservatory Garden's south garden, at 104th Street and Fifth Avenue, as the site for the memorial. It is believed that the two figures, a reclining boy playing the flute and the young girl holding the bowl, represent Mary and Dickon, the main characters from ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.\n\n===Historical figures===\n[[File:SimonBolivarCentralParkNYC.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (Central Park)|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'']]\n[[File:Christopher columbus321.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|Statue of Christopher Columbus]]]]\n* The [[equestrian sculpture]] of '''''[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]''''' was originally sited on the rock outcropping between 82nd and 83rd Streets overlooking [[Central Park West]], where the Bol\u00edvar Hotel, once facing it, commemorates its location. After Sixth Avenue was renamed [[Avenue of the Americas]] in 1945, the sculpture was relocated in the 1950s to be adjacent to those of fellow Latin American revolutionary leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] at the head of the Avenue of the Americas.\n* In 1892, the '''[[Statue of Christopher Columbus (Central Park)|statue of Christopher Columbus]]''' was donated to Central Park by the [[New York Genealogical and Biographical Society]] in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of his arrival in the Americas. The statue replicates one made by [[Jeronimo Su\u00f1ol]] in 1892,<ref>The park's sculpture is signed in the bronze \"J. SU\u00d1OL\"; it bears the foundry mark of Federico Masriera Barcelona 1892.</ref> located at the Plaza de Colon, in [[Madrid]]. The New York version was placed in the park in 1894 at the foot of the Mall, and is today one of two monuments of Columbus found in the park's environs, the other being the statue surmounting the column at [[Columbus Circle]].  The sculpture depicts the explorer standing with outstretched arms, looking towards the heavens in gratitude for his successful voyage.\n* The standing [[Statue of Alexander Hamilton (Central Park)|sculpture]] of [[Alexander Hamilton]] standing in a grove of apple trees and crabapples west of the East Drive behind the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was \"presented by [[John Church Hamilton|John C. Hamilton]] 1880\", according to the inscription on its granite base. The donor was the son of Hamilton.

As a result of the outbreak of the World War II, the monument stayed in New York; in July 1945 it was presented to the City of New York by the King Jagiello Monument Committee and permanently placed in Central Park with the cooperation of the last pre-Communist consul of Poland in New York, Kazimierz Krasicki.<ref>{{cite journal|title=In the Footsteps of Stanislaw K.

The regiment was, as its name implies, stationed in New York, and consisted of males mainly from this region. In 1917, the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]'s 7th New York Infantry Registry Division. While in France, they saw heavy action, and at the end of the war in November 1918, of the 3,700 men originally in the regiment, 580 men were killed and 1,487 wounded, with four of the regiment's soldiers being awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  The memorial depicts seven men; the one to the far right carrying two [[Mills bomb]]s, while supporting the wounded soldier next to him. To his right another infantryman (depicting Robert Russell Bennett, a 107 combat veteran who was asked by the artist to model for the statue along with 6 other actual 107 veterans of the Somme) rushes towards the enemy positions, while the helmet less squad leader and another soldier are approaching the enemy with bayonets fixed. To the far left, one soldier is holding a mortally wounded soldier, keeping him on his feet. The [[bronze]] memorial was donated by 7th\u2013107th Memorial Committee, and was designed and sculpted by [[Karl Illava]], who served in the 107th IR as a sergeant in World War I. The monument was first conceived about 1920, was made in 1926\u20131927 and was placed in the park and unveiled in 1927, near the perimeter wall at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 67th Street.\n\n===Writers and poets===\n[[File:NYC Hans C Andersen.jpg|thumb|right|''Hans Christian Andersen'']]\n* '''''[[Hans Christian Andersen]]''''', the famous Danish fairy-tale writer, his most notable work being \"[[The Ugly Duckling]]\". His statue features him sitting and reading to a stray duck. The 1956 work by sculptor [[Georg J.

It was unveiled in Central Park, New York in 1880. It was intended as a companion statue to '''''[[Statue of Walter Scott (New York City)|Sir Walter Scott]]''''' by the same sculptor, erected some eight years previously.\n* '''''[[Statue of Fitz-Greene Halleck|Fitz-Greene Halleck]]''''' has been described as the ''least known literary figure today on Literary Walk'', despite being the only person to have a memorial unveiled by the then-[[president of the United States]], [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1877, ten years after his death in November 1867. The monument was funded by the use of public subscription, and had a long list of prominent guests and speakers at the dedication and unveiling of the monument, among them the president's cabinet, [[General of the Army]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.Sherman]], the poets [[Bayard Taylor]], [[George Henry Boker]] and [[William Cullen Bryant]], as well as other notable citizens.  The monument is made in bronze by [[James Wilson Alexander MacDonald]], and is placed near the Literary Walk and The Mall. The monument has been thoroughly refurbished by The Central Park Conservancy, first by hot waxing it in 1983, and then again in 1992, as well as in 1999, when it was dewaxed, pressure-washed and repatinated, and then protected by a coating of a corrosion-inhibiting lacquer.\n* '''''[[Statue of William Shakespeare (New York City)|William Shakespeare]]''''', a bronze statue on a stone pedestal, located to the south of the mall, southeast of Sheep's Meadow; this sculpture was erected with funds raised from a benefit performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' on November 25, 1864, at [[The Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|The Winter Garden Theatre]], in a performance by [[Edwin Booth]], [[Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.]] and their younger brother, [[John Wilkes Booth]]. [[John Quincy Adams Ward]] sculpted the work. Ward was arguably the dean of American sculpture at the time, and he is the source of more public sculpture in NYC than any other artist. This is the artist's second of four works in Central Park.\n\n===Other sculptures===\n* ''The Angel of the Waters'' / '''[[Bethesda Fountain]]''' (unveiled in 1873) was not in the original \"Greensward Plan\", developed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]]; the architectural middle of the park was called \"The Water Terrace\", for its placement beside The Lake, but the area became known as Bethesda Terrace after the fountain was unveiled in 1873. At the unveiling ceremony, the artist's brochure quoted a Biblical verse from the Gospel of St. John: ''Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called\u2026 Bethesda\u2026whoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''  The fountain was designed and created by [[Emma Stebbins]], who became the first woman to receive a sculptural commission in New York City when she was commissioned to create this fountain. <!-- CHECK It is one of the few monuments donated by NYC itself--> It was designed and created in 1868, but wasn't unveiled until 1873, when the park was officially completed. In 1988. the [[Central Park Conservancy]] cleaned, repatinated, and sealed the fountain with a protective coating, and it is washed and waxed annually in order to preserve it. The fountain can be found in the middle of the park, on the north side of 72nd Street.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n* '''''[[Indian Hunter (Ward)|Indian Hunter]]''''' (1866) by [[John Quincy Adams Ward]]<ref>Signed in the bronze \"J.Q.A.

The Big Dig, or Central Artery/Tunnel project as it was officially known, was intended to replace an elevated Interstate freeway and connecting roads with a tunnel system underneath Boston. The project was beset with bad engineering, shoddy workmanship, and the death of an automobile passenger as a poor ceiling design caused a tunnel roof section to collapse on a car in the tunnel, crushing the victim. The Big Dig was years over schedule and engineering costs to several times of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff's original estimates, from $8 Billion to in excess of $24 Billion. Due to the poor construction, it has been estimated that the Big Dig's life span will be far short of the original specification that taxpayers paid for. The tunnels still have \"thousands of leaks\" and substandard materials. Subsequent to the fatal tunnel ceiling collapse, light fixtures have been found to have been incorrectly installed and corroding, posing a risk of failure and falling to the tunnel roadway.<ref>[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found - Big Dig News Story - WCVB Boston] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523000000/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html |date=May 23, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nParsons Brinckerhoff was also the lead engineering firm to build the [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] transportation center.

The Big Dig, or Central Artery/Tunnel project as it was officially known, was intended to replace an elevated Interstate freeway and connecting roads with a tunnel system underneath Boston. The project was beset with bad engineering, shoddy workmanship, and the death of an automobile passenger as a poor ceiling design caused a tunnel roof section to collapse on a car in the tunnel, crushing the victim. The Big Dig was years over schedule and engineering costs to several times of Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff's original estimates, from $8 Billion to in excess of $24 Billion. Due to the poor construction, it has been estimated that the Big Dig's life span will be far short of the original specification that taxpayers paid for. The tunnels still have \"thousands of leaks\" and substandard materials. Subsequent to the fatal tunnel ceiling collapse, light fixtures have been found to have been incorrectly installed and corroding, posing a risk of failure and falling to the tunnel roadway.<ref>[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found - Big Dig News Story - WCVB Boston] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523000000/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html |date=May 23, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nParsons Brinckerhoff was also the lead engineering firm to build the [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] transportation center.

The ''Ta\u1e95kirah'' uses the story of the Four Imams as a device to frame the chronicle, the Four Imams being a group of Islamic scholars from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq), who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by the Kara-Khanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=6 August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher= The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=  71 |issue= 3|pages=632 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> The legend of the conquest of Khotan is also given in the hagiology known as the Tazkirat or \"Chronicles of Boghra\".<ref name=\"sykes\"/> Extracts from the Tazkiratu'l-Bughra on the Muslim war against the \"infidel\" Khotan was translated by [[Robert Barkley Shaw]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Shaw|title=A Sketch of the Turki Language: As Spoken in Eastern Turkistan ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw7gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1878|pages=102\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe shrines of Sufi Saints are revered in [[Altishahr]] as one of Islam's essential components and the tazkirah literature reinforced the sacredness of the shrines.

Written sometime in the period from 1700-1849, the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur) '' Ta\u1e95kirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams'' provides an account of the Muslim Kara-Khanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists. The ''Ta\u1e95kirah'' uses the story of the Four Imams as a device to frame the chronicle, the Four Imams being a group of Islamic scholars from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq), who travelled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by the Kara-Khanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thum |first=Rian |date=6 August 2012 |title= Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism |url= https://www.academia.edu/1558522 |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |publisher= The Association for Asian Studies, Inc. 2012 |volume=  71 |issue= 3|pages=632 |doi= 10.1017/S0021911812000629 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref> The legend of the conquest of Khotan is also given in the hagiology known as the Tazkirat or \"Chronicles of Boghra\".<ref name=\"sykes\"/> Extracts from the Tazkiratu'l-Bughra on the Muslim war against the \"infidel\" Khotan was translated by [[Robert Barkley Shaw]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Shaw|title=A Sketch of the Turki Language: As Spoken in Eastern Turkistan ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dw7gAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1878|pages=102\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe shrines of Sufi Saints are revered in [[Altishahr]] as one of Islam's essential components and the tazkirah literature reinforced the sacredness of the shrines.

At the time of the Qing conquest in 1759, Dzungaria was inhabited by the [[Dzungar people|Dzongar people]], a steppe dwelling, nomadic Mongol-related ethnic group who practiced [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]]. Meanwhile, the Tarim Basin was inhabited by sedentary, oasis dwelling, Turkic speaking Muslim farmers, now known as the [[Uyghur people]]. They were governed separately until 1884. The native Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is [[Altishahr]].\n\nThe Qing dynasty was well aware of the differences between the former Buddhist Mongol area to the north of the Tianshan and Turkic Muslim south of the Tianshan, and ruled them in separate administrative units at first.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false Liu & Faure 1996], p. 69.</ref> However, Qing people began to think of both areas as part of one distinct region called Xinjiang .<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q&f=false Liu & Faure 1996], p. 70.</ref> The very concept of Xinjiang as one distinct geographic identity was created by the Qing and it was originally not the native inhabitants who viewed it that way, but rather it was the Chinese who held that point of view.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q&f=false Liu & Faure 1996], p. 67.</ref> During the Qing rule, no sense of \"regional identity\" was held by ordinary Xinjiang people; rather, Xinjiang's distinct identity was given to the region by the Qing, since it had distinct geography, history and culture, while at the same time it was created by the Chinese, multicultural, settled by Han and Hui, and separated from Central Asia for over a century and a half.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false Liu & Faure 1996], p. 77.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Dzungar genocide]] the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] exterminated the native Buddhist [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongolic speaking people from their homeland of [[Dzungaria]] in Northern Xinjiang and resettled the area with a variety of different ethnic groups.\n\nThe Qing \"final solution\" of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungar Mongols, made the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of Han Chinese, Hui, Turkestani Oasis people (Uyghurs) and Manchu Bannermen in Dzungaria possible, since the land was now devoid of Dzungars.<ref name=\"Zungar2\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&pg=PA285&dq=Zunghar+genocide&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZutWU-yoLOi_sQTcn4CgBg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=Zunghar%20genocide&f=false Perdue 2009], p. 285.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kbpG8QEguXEC&pg=PT183&dq=1640+zunghar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=geATVPuYMc3jsATdoYLgBQ&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=1640%20zunghar&f=false Tamm 2013],</ref> The [[Dzungaria]]n basin, which used to be inhabited by (Dzungar) Mongols, is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false Tyler 2004], p. 4.</ref> In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Dzungar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"ed.

Since it was the crushing of the Buddhist \u00d6\u00f6l\u00f6d (Dzungars) by the Qing which led to promotion of Islam and the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, and migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, it was proposed by Henry Schwarz that \"the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false Liu & Faure 1996], p. 72.</ref> Xinjiang as a unified, defined geographic identity was created and developed by the Qing.

As a result, new Uyghur colonists from Southern Xinjiang (the Tarim Basin) proceeded to settle in the newly empty lands and spread across all of Xinjiang.\n\nAfter Xinjiang was converted into a province by the Qing, the provincialisation and reconstruction programs initiated by the Qing resulted in the Chinese government helping Uyghurs migrate from southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province, like the area between Qitai and the capital, which was formerly nearly completely inhabited by Han Chinese, and other areas like Urumqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor, and the Tarim River's lower reaches.<ref>{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA151 p. 151].</ref> It was during Qing times that Uyghurs were settled throughout all of Xinjiang, from their original home cities in the western Tarim Basin. The Qing policies after they created Xinjiang by uniting Dzungaria and Altishahr (Tarim Basin) led Uyghurs to believe that the all of Xinjiang province was their homeland, since the annihilation of the Dzungars by the Qing, populating the Ili valley with Uyghurs from the Tarim Basin, creating one political unit with a single name (Xinjiang) out of the previously separate Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin, the [[Dungan revolt (1862\u201377)|war from 1864-1878]] which led to the killing of much of the original Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslims in Xinjiang, led to areas in Xinjiang with previously had insignificant amounts of Uyghurs, like the southeast, east, and north, to then become settled by Uyghurs who spread through all of Xinjiang from their original home in the southwest area. There was a major and fast growth of the Uyghur population, while the original population of Han Chinese and Hui Muslims from before the war of 155,000 dropped, to the much lower population of 33,114 Tungans (Hui) and 66,000 Han.<ref>{{harvtxt|Millward|2007}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&pg=PA152 p. 152].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Islamization]]\n*[[Persecution of Buddhists#Persecution by Muslims]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |given=Johan |surname=Elverskog |title = Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road |year=2011 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn = 978-0-8122-0531-2 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |given=Valerie |surname=Hansen |title = The Silk Road: A New History |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195159318 |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn = 978-0-19-993921-3 |ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book |given=James A. |surname=Millward |title = Eurasian Crossroads: A History of Xinjiang |year = 2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn = 978-0-231-13924-3 |ref = harv }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Xinjiang topics}}\n{{Cultural assimilation}}\n\n[[Category:Cultural assimilation]]\n[[Category:Islamization]]\n[[Category:History of Xinjiang]]\n[[Category:Persecution by Muslims]]\n[[Category:Persecution of Buddhists]]\n[[Category:Anti-Buddhism]]\n[[Category:Violence in China]]\n[[Category:Islam in China]]\n[[Category:Islamic fundamentalism]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Urumqi \u2192 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, 1700-1849 \u2192 1700\u20131849", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_and_Turkification_of_Xinjiang"}
