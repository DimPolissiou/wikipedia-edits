The mature [[hermaphrodite]] is oval in shape, reddish-brown with black hairs, 5&nbsp;mm long. When mature, the insect remains stationary, attaches itself to the plant by waxy secretions, and produces a white egg sac in grooves, by extrusion, in the body which encases hundreds of red eggs. The egg sac will grow to be two to three times as long as the body. Newly hatched nymphs are the primary dispersal stage, with dispersion known to occur by wind and by crawling. Early stage nymphs feed from the midrib veins of leaves and small twigs, and do the bulk of the damage. At each molt, they leave at the old feeding point the former skin and the waxy secretions in which they had covered themselves and from which their common name is derived. Unlike many other scale insects, they retain legs and a limited mobility in all life stages. Older nymphs migrate to larger twigs and eventually as adults to branches and the trunk. Their life cycle is highly temperature dependent, as the length of time in each stage of life is longer in cold temperatures than high temperatures.\n\nIn addition to the direct damage from sap sucking, the insects also secrete [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], on which [[sooty mold]] often grows and causes further damage to the host plant. Some [[ants]] will also consume this honeydew.\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Icerya_purchasi_male.jpg| thumb| left|Illustration of a male]]\nMales are rare in hermaphroditic species of ''Icerya''. Males are haploid while females are diploid. Females have an ovitestis that is capable of producing both sperm and oocytes which fertilize internally to produce diploid offspring (females) through a form of hermaphroditism. The cells of the ovitestis are haploid and are derived from excess sperm during matings with males. This has been termed as 'parasitic tissue' and theoretical studies have examined this as a form of [[sexual conflict]] and have examined the possible fates and fitness consequences since females can produce daughters by mating with males or using their parasitic male cell lines. Females that lack ovitestes may preferentially invest in producing sons while females with parasitic tissue should prefer to pass on the genetic material through daughters.<ref>{{cite journal| title=The Evolution of Hermaphroditism by an Infectious Male-Derived Cell Lineage: An Inclusive-Fitness Analysis|first1= Andy |first2=Gardner |last1= Laura|last2= Ross| journal= The American Naturalist|volume=178| issue= 2 |year=2011| pages= 191-201|doi=10.1086/660823 }}</ref>\n\nTrue males are uncommon to rare overall, and in many infestations are not present.

Importations of the vedalia ladybird (''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'') in 1888-1889 by [[Charles Valentine Riley|C. V. Riley]], later head of the [[USDA]]'s Division of Entomology, resulted in swift reductions of ''I. purchasi'' populations, saving the burgeoning Californian citrus industry from this destructive pest.\n\nA second biological control, the parasitic fly ''[[Cryptochetum iceryae]]'' has also been introduced to [[California]] as an additional control vector. Use of insecticides as a control is recommended only if no biological control species is present. [[Imidacloprid]] is especially contraindicated, since it has no effect on this species, but is very toxic to ''Rodolia cardinalis''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/fruit/cottony_cushion_scale.htm |title=Cottony cushion scale, ''Icerya purchasi'' Maskell |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author1=Hamon, A.

Importations of the vedalia ladybird (''[[Rodolia cardinalis]]'') in 1888-1889 by [[Charles Valentine Riley|C. V. Riley]], later head of the [[USDA]]'s Division of Entomology, resulted in swift reductions of ''I. purchasi'' populations, saving the burgeoning Californian citrus industry from this destructive pest.\n\nA second biological control, the parasitic fly ''[[Cryptochetum iceryae]]'' has also been introduced to [[California]] as an additional control vector. Use of insecticides as a control is recommended only if no biological control species is present. [[Imidacloprid]] is especially contraindicated, since it has no effect on this species, but is very toxic to ''Rodolia cardinalis''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;General\n*{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/fruit/cottony_cushion_scale.htm |title=Cottony cushion scale, ''Icerya purchasi'' Maskell |accessdate=2008-07-16 |author1=Hamon, A.

Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, ''[[Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]]'', where he published the lectures ''\"God and Computer Science\"''.\n\n===Opinion on software patents===\nAs a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting [[software patent]]s for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the [[interior-point method]] of [[linear programming]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf |title=All Questions Answered |date=March 2002 |type=article |journal=Notices |access-date=March 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430030346/http://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf |archive-date=April 30, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/images/G308Knuth.pdf |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |postscript=Letter |title=Against software patents |access-date=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924040943/http://www.groklaw.net/images/G308Knuth.pdf |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }} to the patent offices in the USA and Europe.</ref>\n\n== Computer Musings ==\nKnuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at [[Stanford University]], which he titled \"Computer Musings\".

The same WEB source is used to ''weave'' a TeX file, and to ''tangle'' a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, [[CWEB]], replaces Pascal with [[C (programming language)|C]].\n\nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books: ''The TeXbook'', which is originally published in 1984, and ''The METAFONTbook'', which is originally published in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|website=www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411233455/https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html|archive-date=April 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Around the same time, [[LaTeX]], the now-widely-adopted macro package based on TeX, was first developed by [[Leslie Lamport]], who later published its first user manual in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724180126/https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide|archive-date=July 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nKnuth is an [[organist]] and a [[composer]].

He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the [[computational complexity]] of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the [[Big O notation|asymptotic notation]]. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of [[theoretical computer science]], Knuth is the creator of the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, the related [[METAFONT]] font definition language and rendering system, and the [[Computer Modern]] family of typefaces.\n\nAs a writer and scholar, Knuth created the [[WEB]] and [[CWEB]] computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate [[literate programming]], and designed the [[MIX]]/[[MMIX]] [[instruction set|instruction set architectures]].

The same WEB source is used to ''weave'' a TeX file, and to ''tangle'' a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, [[CWEB]], replaces Pascal with [[C (programming language)|C]].\n\nKnuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books: ''The TeXbook'', which is originally published in 1984, and ''The METAFONTbook'', which is originally published in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html|title=Knuth: Computers and Typesetting|website=www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411233455/https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html|archive-date=April 11, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Around the same time, [[LaTeX]], the now-widely-adopted macro package based on TeX, was first developed by [[Leslie Lamport]], who later published its first user manual in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724180126/https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide|archive-date=July 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nKnuth is an [[organist]] and a [[composer]].

{"title_page": "Depth of noncommutative subrings", "text_new": "In [[ring theory]] and [[Frobenius algebra]] extensions, areas of mathematics, there is a notion of '''depth two  subring''' or '''depth of a Frobenius extension'''.  The notion of depth two is important in a certain  [[noncommutative Galois theory]], which generates [[Hopf algebroid]]s in place of the more classical [[Galois group]]s, whereas the notion of depth greater than two measures the defect, or distance, from being depth two in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings above the subring. A more recent definition of depth of any unital subring in any associative ring  is proposed (see below) in a paper studying the depth of a subgroup of a finite group as group algebras over a commutative ring.\n\n== Definition and first examples ==\n\nA unital subring <math> B \\subseteq A </math> has (or is) '''right depth two''' if there is a split epimorphism of natural A-B-bimodules from <math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A </math> for some positive integer n; by switching to natural B-A-bimodules, there is a corresponding definition of '''left depth two'''. Here we use the usual notation <math> A^n = A \\times \\ldots \\times A</math> (n times) as well as the common notion, p is a split epimorphism if there is a homomorphism q in the reverse direction such that pq = identity on the image of p. (Sometimes the subring B in A is referred to as the ring extension A over B; the theory works as well for a ring homomorphism B into A, which induces right and left B-modules structures on A.) Equivalently, the condition for left or right depth two may be given in terms of a split monomorphism of bimodules where the domains and codomains above are reversed.\n\nFor example, let A be the group algebra of a finite group G (over any commutative base ring k; see the articles on [[group theory]] and [[group ring]] for the elementary definitions). Let B be the group (sub)algebra of a normal subgroup H of index n in G with coset representatives <math>g_1,\\cdots,g_n</math>. Define a split A-B epimorphism p:<math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A</math> by <math> p((a_1,\\cdots,a_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i g_i^{-1} \\otimes_B g_i </math>.  It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the group algebras of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n:Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.

The notion of depth two is important in a certain  [[noncommutative Galois theory]], which generates [[Hopf algebroid]]s in place of the more classical [[Galois group]]s, whereas the notion of depth greater than two measures the defect, or distance, from being depth two in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings above the subring. A more recent definition of depth of any unital subring in any associative ring  is proposed (see below) in a paper studying the depth of a subgroup of a finite group as group algebras over a commutative ring.\n\n== Definition and first examples ==\n\nA unital subring <math> B \\subseteq A </math> has (or is) '''right depth two''' if there is a split epimorphism of natural A-B-bimodules from <math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A </math> for some positive integer n; by switching to natural B-A-bimodules, there is a corresponding definition of '''left depth two'''. Here we use the usual notation <math> A^n = A \\times \\ldots \\times A</math> (n times) as well as the common notion, p is a split epimorphism if there is a homomorphism q in the reverse direction such that pq = identity on the image of p. (Sometimes the subring B in A is referred to as the ring extension A over B; the theory works as well for a ring homomorphism B into A, which induces right and left B-modules structures on A.) Equivalently, the condition for left or right depth two may be given in terms of a split monomorphism of bimodules where the domains and codomains above are reversed.\n\nFor example, let A be the group algebra of a finite group G (over any commutative base ring k; see the articles on [[group theory]] and [[group ring]] for the elementary definitions). Let B be the group (sub)algebra of a normal subgroup H of index n in G with coset representatives <math>g_1,\\cdots,g_n</math>. Define a split A-B epimorphism p:<math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A</math> by <math> p((a_1,\\cdots,a_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i g_i^{-1} \\otimes_B g_i </math>.  It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the [[group algebra]]s of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n:Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.

Other coronaviruses have been shown to be able to infect the brain via a synaptic route to the [[respiratory centre]] in the [[medulla]], through [[mechanoreceptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]] within the lungs. It is possible that dysfunction within the respiratory centre further exarcebates the ARDS seen in COVID-19 patients.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

According to a 2020 story by [[Yahoo Sports]] journalist Jeff Eisenberg, Fine's development as a quarterback began in the summer before his sixth-grade year, during which he attended a quarterback camp at the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]]. The young Fine paid special attention to former Oklahoma star quarterback and then-current Sooners assistant [[Josh Heupel]], observing Heupel's throwing motion and paying attention to the advice he offered. During each day's drive home from the camp, he wrote down what he had learned. After the camp, Fine and his father typed up the notes, and he went so far as to place a printed copy next to his bed.<ref name=Eisenberg>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/too-short-mason-fine-is-just-fine-proving-doubters-wrong-130958631.html |title=Too short? Mason Fine is just fine proving doubters wrong |first=Jeff |last=Eisenberg |website=Yahoo Sports |date=April 14, 2020 |accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFine was initially trained by his father Dale, who had never played football at any level. Each day, the two would teach one another proper throwing motion via the notes they took at the aforementioned camp. In Eisenberg's story, Dale recalled, \"It was hours and days and months and years of repetition. The motto we went by was that it wasn\u2019t just practice that made perfect. It was perfect practice that made perfect.\" By the time Mason finished his eighth-grade year, they no longer worked on his mechanics. The following summer, he attended a quarterback camp at which an instructor praised his throwing motion and asked about his quarterbacks coach. Eisenberg noted, \"The instructor couldn\u2019t believe it was his dad, let alone that Dale Fine had no previous football experience.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\n==High school==\nSince his hometown of fewer than 1,000 operated only a K\u20138 school, Fine had a choice between several nearby high schools, and enrolled at Locust Grove High School in nearby [[Locust Grove, Oklahoma|Locust Grove]] in 2012. The Pirates had just hired a new head coach after winning only two games in the previous three seasons. Eisenberg noted that the new coach, Matt Hennesy, had to make a decision regarding his new talent\u2014while Fine was the team's best passer, \"Hennesy feared putting a 5-foot-9, 135-pound freshman behind a patchwork offensive line.\" Hennesy decided to start Fine as a wide receiver, but designed a series of trick plays to utilize Fine's throwing ability; Fine would throw for more than 600 yards as a freshman despite not playing quarterback. <ref name=Eisenberg/> He went on to start at quarterback in his remaining three high school seasons, setting the all-time Oklahoma high school record for passing yards and touchdowns and became the first player to ever win the state's [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Player of the Year]] award twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/high-school/locust-grove-s-mason-fine-wins-second-gatorade-oklahoma-player/article_ae25486f-7f81-5282-86c3-e2cc8a99c183.html|title=Locust Grove's Mason Fine wins second Gatorade Oklahoma Player of the Year Award|last=Hoover|first=John E.|date=December 4, 2015|website=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recruitment==\nDespite his gaudy high school statistics, Fine finished his senior season without a single [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offer, largely due to his lack of size. During a summer camp before his senior season, an assistant for [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] pulled him aside, praising his arm strength and ability to escape a collapsing pocket. However, he then told Fine that his small size made it unlikely that he would ever play at a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] school, instead offering to recommend him to [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] or [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] schools. Fine would tell Eisenberg, \"I was polite and told him that I appreciated it, but inside I was fuming.\" This coach was not alone in his sentiment; Fine went without an offer even after sending out numerous highlight tapes and attending camps at four other FBS schools. [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] showed strong interest after Fine's junior season, but went with a considerably taller prospect; [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] recruited him only as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]], and did not make him an offer even after its main quarterback target rescinded a verbal commitment to the school; and when Hennesy called [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State's]] [[Bill Snyder]] about Fine, Snyder responded that he didn't recruit quarterbacks under 6 feet tall.<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\nFine caught a break when [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] hired [[Seth Littrell]] as head coach shortly after the end of the [[2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2015 season]]. Littrell, a former Oklahoma player who grew up in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], was a close friend of Hennesy who operated an [[Air raid offense|Air Raid offense]] similar to the one that Fine quarterbacked at Locust Grove. Shortly after his hiring, Littrell called Hennesy to ask about available quarterbacks; while North Texas had an incoming graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for the 2016 season, Littrell sought a future prospect. Littrell and his staff were sold on Fine's ability; he would tell Eisenberg,<ref name=Eisenberg/>{{blockquote|There were local kids with [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] offers who were calling us because they wanted to play in our system, but he was better than them. To be honest, we kept laughing because it wasn\u2019t even close. If this kid was 6-2 or 6-3, he\u2019d have been offered by everyone in the country..}}\n\nSensing that this was his best chance at an FBS offer, Fine made makeshift lifts for his shoes in order to appear taller for his North Texas visit. For his part, Littrell would say, \"He could have shown up in combat boots with four-inch heels and we\u2019d have taken him.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/> On February 3, 2016, Fine signed a [[National Letter of Intent]] with North Texas.<ref name=\"247sports\">{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Player/Mason-Fine-78299/high-school-136282/|title=Mason Fine, Locust Grove, Pro-Style Quarterback|work=[[247Sports.com]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n=== North Texas ===\n\n==== 2016 ====\nFine started nine games for [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] as a true freshman in 2016, throwing for 1,572 yards and breaking the school record for longest play from scrimmage with an 80-yard touchdown run against [[UTSA Roadrunners football|UTSA]] to earn a spot on the [[Conference USA]] All-Freshman team <ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferenceusa.com/news/2016/12/6/FB_1206163929.aspx|title=C-USA All-Freshman Team|date=December 6, 2016|website=[[Conference USA]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== 2017\u20132018 ====\nOver his sophomore and junior years, Fine led the Mean Green to 9 victories in each season and threw for a total of 7,845 yards and 58 touchdowns.

According to a 2020 story by [[Yahoo Sports]] journalist Jeff Eisenberg, Fine's development as a quarterback began in the summer before his sixth-grade year, during which he attended a quarterback camp at the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]]. The young Fine paid special attention to former Oklahoma star quarterback and then-current Sooners assistant [[Josh Heupel]], observing Heupel's throwing motion and paying attention to the advice he offered. During each day's drive home from the camp, he wrote down what he had learned. After the camp, Fine and his father typed up the notes, and he went so far as to place a printed copy next to his bed.<ref name=Eisenberg>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/too-short-mason-fine-is-just-fine-proving-doubters-wrong-130958631.html |title=Too short? Mason Fine is just fine proving doubters wrong |first=Jeff |last=Eisenberg |website=Yahoo Sports |date=April 14, 2020 |accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFine was initially trained by his father Dale, who had never played football at any level. Each day, the two would teach one another proper throwing motion via the notes they took at the aforementioned camp. In Eisenberg's story, Dale recalled, \"It was hours and days and months and years of repetition. The motto we went by was that it wasn\u2019t just practice that made perfect. It was perfect practice that made perfect.\" By the time Mason finished his eighth-grade year, they no longer worked on his mechanics. The following summer, he attended a quarterback camp at which an instructor praised his throwing motion and asked about his quarterbacks coach. Eisenberg noted, \"The instructor couldn\u2019t believe it was his dad, let alone that Dale Fine had no previous football experience.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\n==High school==\nSince his hometown of fewer than 1,000 operated only a K\u20138 school, Fine had a choice between several nearby high schools, and enrolled at Locust Grove High School in nearby [[Locust Grove, Oklahoma|Locust Grove]] in 2012. The Pirates had just hired a new head coach after winning only two games in the previous three seasons. Eisenberg noted that the new coach, Matt Hennesy, had to make a decision regarding his new talent\u2014while Fine was the team's best passer, \"Hennesy feared putting a 5-foot-9, 135-pound freshman behind a patchwork offensive line.\" Hennesy decided to start Fine as a wide receiver, but designed a series of trick plays to utilize Fine's throwing ability; Fine would throw for more than 600 yards as a freshman despite not playing quarterback. <ref name=Eisenberg/> He went on to start at quarterback in his remaining three high school seasons, setting the all-time Oklahoma high school record for passing yards and touchdowns and became the first player to ever win the state's [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Player of the Year]] award twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/high-school/locust-grove-s-mason-fine-wins-second-gatorade-oklahoma-player/article_ae25486f-7f81-5282-86c3-e2cc8a99c183.html|title=Locust Grove's Mason Fine wins second Gatorade Oklahoma Player of the Year Award|last=Hoover|first=John E.|date=December 4, 2015|website=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recruitment==\nDespite his gaudy high school statistics, Fine finished his senior season without a single [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offer, largely due to his lack of size. During a summer camp before his senior season, an assistant for [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] pulled him aside, praising his arm strength and ability to escape a collapsing pocket. However, he then told Fine that his small size made it unlikely that he would ever play at a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] school, instead offering to recommend him to [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] or [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] schools. Fine would tell Eisenberg, \"I was polite and told him that I appreciated it, but inside I was fuming.\" This coach was not alone in his sentiment; Fine went without an offer even after sending out numerous highlight tapes and attending camps at four other FBS schools. [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] showed strong interest after Fine's junior season, but went with a considerably taller prospect; [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] recruited him only as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]], and did not make him an offer even after its main quarterback target rescinded a verbal commitment to the school; and when Hennesy called [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State's]] [[Bill Snyder]] about Fine, Snyder responded that he didn't recruit quarterbacks under 6 feet tall.<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\nFine caught a break when [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] hired [[Seth Littrell]] as head coach shortly after the end of the [[2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2015 season]]. Littrell, a former Oklahoma player who grew up in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], was a close friend of Hennesy who operated an [[Air Raid offense]] similar to the one that Fine quarterbacked at Locust Grove. Shortly after his hiring, Littrell called Hennesy to ask about available quarterbacks; while North Texas had an incoming graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for the 2016 season, Littrell sought a future prospect. Littrell and his staff were sold on Fine's ability; he would tell Eisenberg,<ref name=Eisenberg/>{{blockquote|There were local kids with [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] offers who were calling us because they wanted to play in our system, but he was better than them. To be honest, we kept laughing because it wasn\u2019t even close. If this kid was 6-2 or 6-3, he\u2019d have been offered by everyone in the country..}}\n\nSensing that this was his best chance at an FBS offer, Fine made makeshift lifts for his shoes in order to appear taller for his North Texas visit. For his part, Littrell would say, \"He could have shown up in combat boots with four-inch heels and we\u2019d have taken him.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/> On February 3, 2016, Fine signed a [[National Letter of Intent]] with North Texas.<ref name=\"247sports\">{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Player/Mason-Fine-78299/high-school-136282/|title=Mason Fine, Locust Grove, Pro-Style Quarterback|work=[[247Sports.com]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n=== North Texas ===\n\n==== 2016 ====\nFine started nine games for [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] as a true freshman in 2016, throwing for 1,572 yards and breaking the school record for longest play from scrimmage with an 80-yard touchdown run against [[UTSA Roadrunners football|UTSA]] to earn a spot on the [[Conference USA]] All-Freshman team <ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferenceusa.com/news/2016/12/6/FB_1206163929.aspx|title=C-USA All-Freshman Team|date=December 6, 2016|website=[[Conference USA]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== 2017\u20132018 ====\nOver his sophomore and junior years, Fine led the Mean Green to 9 victories in each season and threw for a total of 7,845 yards and 58 touchdowns.

Kadomtsev (1928\u20131998) and Vladimir I. Petviashvili (1936\u20131993); it came as a natural generalization of the KdV equation (derived by Korteweg and De Vries in 1895).  Whereas in the KdV equation waves are strictly one-dimensional, in the KP equation this restriction is relaxed. Still, both in the KdV and the KP equation, waves have to travel in the positive ''x''-direction.\n\n==Connections to physics==\n\nThe KP equation can be used to model [[water wave]]s of long [[wavelength]] with weakly non-linear restoring forces and [[dispersion (water waves)|frequency dispersion]].  If [[surface tension]] is weak compared to [[Earth's gravity|gravitational forces]], <math>\\lambda=+1</math> is used; if surface tension is strong, then <math>\\lambda=-1</math>.  Because of the asymmetry in the way ''x''- and ''y''-terms enter the equation, the waves described by the KP equation behave differently in the direction of propagation (''x''-direction) and transverse (''y'') direction; oscillations in the ''y''-direction tend to be smoother (be of small-deviation).\n\nThe KP equation can also be used to model waves in [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] media<ref>Leblond, H. (2002). KP lumps in ferromagnets: a three-dimensional KdV\u2013Burgers model.

Because of the asymmetry in the way ''x''- and ''y''-terms enter the equation, the waves described by the KP equation behave differently in the direction of propagation (''x''-direction) and transverse (''y'') direction; oscillations in the ''y''-direction tend to be smoother (be of small-deviation).\n\nThe KP equation can also be used to model waves in [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] media<ref>Leblond, H. (2002). KP lumps in ferromagnets: a three-dimensional KdV\u2013Burgers model. Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, 35(47), 10149.</ref>, as well as two-dimensional matter\u2013wave pulses in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]s.\n\n==Limiting behavior==\n\nFor <math>\\epsilon\\ll 1</math>, typical ''x''-dependent oscillations have a wavelength of <math>O(1/\\epsilon)</math> giving a singular limiting regime as <math>\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0</math>.  The limit <math>\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0</math> is called the [[Dispersionless equation|dispersion]]less limit<ref>Zakharov, V. E. (1994). Dispersionless limit of integrable systems in 2+ 1 dimensions. In Singular limits of dispersive waves (pp. 165-174). Springer, Boston, MA.</ref><ref>Strachan, I. A. (1995). The Moyal bracket and the dispersionless limit of the KP hierarchy. Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General, 28(7), 1967.</ref><ref>Takasaki, K., & Takebe, T. (1995). Integrable hierarchies and dispersionless limit. Reviews in Mathematical Physics, 7(05), 743-808.</ref>.\n\nIf we also assume that the solutions are independent of ''y'' as <math>\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0</math>, then they also satisfy the inviscid [[Burgers' equation]]:\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\partial_t u+u\\partial_x u=0.</math>\n\nSuppose the amplitude of oscillations of a solution is asymptotically small \u2014 <math>O(\\epsilon)</math> \u2014 in the dispersionless limit. Then the amplitude satisfies a mean-field equation of [[Davey\u2013Stewartson equations|Davey\u2013Stewartson]] type.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Novikov\u2013Veselov equation]]\n* [[Schottky problem]]\n* [[Dispersionless equation#Dispersionless KP equation|Dispersionless KP equation]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite journal|first1=B.
