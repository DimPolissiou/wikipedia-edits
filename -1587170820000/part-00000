She gathered the folktales, stories, and archaic dialects of the rural communities she visited in her home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and wove them into her first novel, ''[[Lamb in His Bosom]]'', for which she won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1934. Her success as the first Georgian winner<ref name=\"Asheville\"/> of the fiction prize inspired [[Macmillan Publishers]] to seek out more southern writers, resulting in the discovery of [[Margaret Mitchell]], whose first novel, ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', also won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937.\n\n==Early years and education==\nCaroline Pafford was born on August 26, 1903, in [[Waycross, Georgia]], to Elias Pafford and Levy Zan (Hall) Pafford.<ref name=\"NGE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/caroline-miller-1903-1992|title=Caroline Miller (1903-1992)|publisher=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|author= Carey O.
