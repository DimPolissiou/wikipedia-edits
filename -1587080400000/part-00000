Evidence of the lingam in India dates back to prehistoric times. Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized \"heads\", or the glans, are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad. The famous \"man-size\" lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in [[Gudimallam]], [[Chitoor District]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] known as the [[Gudimallam Lingam]], is about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} in height, carved in polished black granite. It is one of the existing lingams from the pre-Buddhist period. The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent, bulbous \"glans\", and an anthropomorphic form of [[Parashurama]] carved in high relief on the shaft.<ref>[[T. A. Gopinatha Rao|Rao, T. A. Gopinatha]], ''Elements Of Hindu Iconography'', Vol II Part 1, 1916, Law Printing House, Madras ([[Chennai]]), [https://archive.org/details/ElementsOfHinduIconographyVolIIPart1/page/n95 Internet Archive (fully online)], p. 65 on; [https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rediscovering-shivas-south-ii-gudimallam-lingam-rock-fort-40201 thenewsminute.com]</ref> Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries, and existing lingams from before the 6th century show more leaning towards a naturalistic style, with the \"glans\" clearly indicated.\n\nThe earliest depictions of Shiva as a figure humjan form are ithyphallic, as for example in coins of the [[Kushan Empire]].  Some figures up to about the 11th century AD have erect phalluses, although they become increasingly rare.\n \n==== Etymology of \u201clinga\u201d, or \u201clingam\u201d ====\n<blockquote>Linguistic evidence indicates that the post-Vedic Hindus not only adopted the tradition/ cult of the linga from the pre-Vedic non-Aryans, but even the term itself is of [[Austric languages|Austric]] origin.\n\n\u2014 Mahadev Chakravarti: ''The Concept of Rudra-Siva Through the Ages'' (p. 130)</blockquote>\n\nThe word \"linga\", while ubiquitous in the Austro-Asiatic world, cannot be seen originally to be occurring in the Indo-European languages. Chakravarti further says that when these two words entered Sanskrit, they, along with another word \"langula\" (tail) were derivations of the same root syllable \"lang\" or \"lng\". If this correlation is accepted on the basis of the obvious phonetic proximity between the three words linga ~ langala ~ langula, then it is not hard to recognize the semantic evolution of the words \u2014 because the usage of the phallus or the male generative organ in human procreation and the usage of a tool/implement like the ploughshare (langula) to till the earth for its fertility to bring forth life-supporting vegetation have a natural and spontaneous symbolical parallel and similarity to each other. Stone lingams have been found in several [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites, varying in size from 3 feet in length to very small pieces.{{cn|date=December 2019}} These are found to be of steatite, sandstone and burnt clay. Some among these are unmistakably naturalistic in their rendition.

During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth.

Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.<ref>J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.</ref> Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.\n\n==Psychoanalysis==\n[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]\nThe symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between \"being\" and \"having\" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire.\n\nIn ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.\n\n==Modern use of the phallus==\nThe phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is \"[[Princess X]]\"<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]</ref> by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus.

Evidence of the lingam in India dates back to prehistoric times. Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized \"heads\", or the glans, are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad. The famous \"man-size\" lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in [[Gudimallam]], [[Chitoor District]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] known as the [[Gudimallam Lingam]], is about {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} in height, carved in polished black granite. It is one of the existing lingams from the pre-Buddhist period. The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent, bulbous \"glans\", and an anthropomorphic form of [[Parashurama]] carved in high relief on the shaft.<ref>[[T. A. Gopinatha Rao|Rao, T. A. Gopinatha]], ''Elements Of Hindu Iconography'', Vol II Part 1, 1916, Law Printing House, Madras ([[Chennai]]), [https://archive.org/details/ElementsOfHinduIconographyVolIIPart1/page/n95 Internet Archive (fully online)], p. 65 on; [https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/rediscovering-shivas-south-ii-gudimallam-lingam-rock-fort-40201 thenewsminute.com]</ref> Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries, and existing lingams from before the 6th century show more leaning towards a naturalistic style, with the \"glans\" clearly indicated.\n\nThe earliest depictions of Shiva as a figure humjan form are ithyphallic, as for example in coins of the [[Kushan Empire]].  Some figures up to about the 11th century AD have erect phalluses, although they become increasingly rare.\n \n==== Etymology of \u201clinga\u201d, or \u201clingam\u201d ====\n<blockquote>Linguistic evidence indicates that the post-Vedic Hindus not only adopted the tradition/ cult of the linga from the pre-Vedic non-Aryans, but even the term itself is of [[Austric languages|Austric]] origin.\n\n\u2014 Mahadev Chakravarti: ''The Concept of Rudra-Siva Through the Ages'' (p. 130)</blockquote>\n\nThe word \"linga\", while ubiquitous in the Austro-Asiatic world, cannot be seen originally to be occurring in the Indo-European languages. Chakravarti further says that when these two words entered Sanskrit, they, along with another word \"langula\" (tail) were derivations of the same root syllable \"lang\" or \"lng\". If this correlation is accepted on the basis of the obvious phonetic proximity between the three words linga ~ langala ~ langula, then it is not hard to recognize the semantic evolution of the words \u2014 because the usage of the phallus or the male generative organ in human procreation and the usage of a tool/implement like the ploughshare (langula) to till the earth for its fertility to bring forth life-supporting vegetation have a natural and spontaneous symbolical parallel and similarity to each other. Stone lingams have been found in several [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites, varying in size from 3 feet in length to very small pieces.{{cn|date=December 2019}} These are found to be of steatite, sandstone and burnt clay.

Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire.\n\nIn ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.\n\n==Modern use of the phallus==\nThe phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is \"[[Princess X]]\"<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]</ref> by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W.
