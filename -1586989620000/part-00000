Son of Francesco di Francesco Gunduli\u0107 (senator and diplomat, once the Ragusan envoy to Constantinople and councilor of the Republic to the Pope Gregory VIII) and Djiva Gradic (de Gradi). He received an excellent education. He probably studied the humanities with the Jesuit [[Silvestro Muzio]] and philosophy with [[Ridolfo Ricasoli]] and [[Camillo Camilli]] (*Siena -+1615),<ref>F.M.Appendini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2kAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10-IA2&lpg=PA10-IA2&dq=silvestro+muzio&source=bl&ots=aGeQN7Qorx&sig=ZeJaaKsOrojT8svmjsxTybiPddk&hl=it&ei=LlbHSZaCK-TCjAe24fGUCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result Versione libera dell'Osmanide]'', Per Antonio Martecchini, Ragusa 1827</ref> who in late 1590 had been appointed ''rettore delle scuole e professore di umane lettere'' in Ragusa. After that he studied Roman law and jurisprudence in general, where he held numerous offices for the Great Council of the Republic. In 1608, when he was nineteen, he became a member of the Veliko vie\u0107e (Great Council).  Twice, in 1615 and 1619, he held the temporary function of knez (commissary or governor) of Konavle, an area southeast of the city.\n\nAt the age of thirty he married with Nicoleta Sorko\u010devi\u0107 (Sorgo)(+1644) who bore him three sons, Frano (Francesco), Matheo (Mato), \u0160i\u0161ko (Segismondo) and two daughters, Maria (Mara) Gondola and Dziva (Giovanna). [[Fran D\u017eivo Gunduli\u0107]] and [[Mato Gunduli\u0107]] (1636\u20131684) fought in the thirty-years war under [[Wallenstein]]; the youngest died on January 16, 1682, being by then the Rector of the Republic. From 1621 until his death Ivan held various offices in the city government. In 1636 he became a senator, in 1637 a judge, and in 1638 a member of the Small Council (''Malo vie\u0107e''). Had he lived a little longer \u2013 he died of an intense fever, product of an inflammation in his ribs ( ''Folio 15 Libr. Mort. N\u00b0274, Adi le Xbre 1638 Ragusa'') \u2013 he would probably have been elected knez of the Dubrovnik Republic, the highest function that was held for one month only by meritorious gentlemen at least fifty years old. His father, who died in 1624, had been ''knez'' five times, and Ivan's son [[\u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107]] later four times. Ivan Gunduli\u0107 was buried in the [[Franciscan church and monastery (Dubrovnik)|Franciscan church]] of Dubrovnik.\n[[File:Dubrovnik (76).JPG|thumb|250px|Tomb of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in the Franciscan church, Dubrovnik]]\nHe began his literary career by writing poems and staging melodramas that became popular in Dubrovnik. But Ivan published only his larger works. His earlier work, which he referred to as a \"brood of darkness\", is now lost. His first publications were in 1621, when he rewrote several of David's Psalms and wrote several religious poems. He then wrote his famous ''Suze sina razmetnoga'' ([[Tears of the Prodigal Son]]) in 1622, composed of three \"Cries\": ''Sagrie\u0161enje'' (Sin), ''Spoznanje'' (Insight) and ''Skru\u0161enje'' (Humility). In this poem Ivan presented the three basic categories of [[Christianity|Christian faith]]: sin, repentance and redemption through contrasts such as between life and death, purity and sin, and Heaven and Hell. In 1637 when [[Ferdinand II of Tuscany]] married, Gunduli\u0107 wrote a poem to honor the event, he noted that ''\"all of Slavic people (Slovinski narod) honor you on this occasion\"''.\n\n===''Dubravka''===\nGunduli\u0107's most famous play is ''[[Dubravka (drama)|Dubravka]]'', a [[pastoral]] written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and contains some of the most famous verses in [[Croatian literature]]:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''[[Croatian language|Croatian]]'''\n\n<poem>\n       O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,\ndar u kom sva blaga vi\u0161nji nam Bog je do,\n   uzro\u010de istini od na\u0161e sve slave,\nuresu jedini od ove Dubrave,\n   sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki \u017eivoti\nne mogu bit plata tvoj \u010distoj lipoti.\n\n</poem>\n{{col-2}}\n'''English'''\n\n<poem>\n    Fair liberty, beloved liberty, liberty sweetly avowed,\nthou are the treasured gift that God to us endowed,\n   all our glory is thy true creation,\nto our Home thou are all the decoration,\n   no silver nor gold, not life itself could replace\nthe reward of thy pure and sublime grace.\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===''Osman''===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nIn his greatest work, ''Osman'', Gunduli\u0107 presents the contrasts between Christianity and Islam, Europe and the Turks, West and East, and what he viewed as freedom and slavery. ''Osman'' had 20 cantos, but the 14th and the 15th were never found. Judging from the modern perspective, two approaches seem to dominate the contemporary appraisal of Gunduli\u0107's poetry: on one hand, his poetic influence has dimmed due to a change in aesthetic sensibility (Gunduli\u0107's chief literary predecessor and influence, [[Torquato Tasso]], has undergone similar reassessment, but his artistic integrity and individuality have withstood the test of time better); while Gunduli\u0107's impact in the final standardisation of the [[Croatian language]] was overwhelming.\n[[File:Dubrovnik (45).JPG|thumb|Bronze relief on the statue of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in Dubrovnik, showing a scene from the ninth canto where Sun\u010danica is taken to the Sultan's harem]]\n\n''Osman'' is firmly rooted within the rich literary tradition of the Croatian [[Baroque]] in Dubrovnik and [[Dalmatia]] and is considered as one of its apogees. By presenting the contrast of struggle between Christianity and Islam, Gunduli\u0107 continued [[Marko Maruli\u0107]]'s glorification of the fights against the invading [[Ottoman Turks]]. Besides magnifying Slavdom and the battles against the conquerors, Gunduli\u0107 described the life of the Ottoman sultan [[Osman II]]. Gunduli\u0107 constantly reminds the reader of the ''wheel of fortune'' and how the world is transient.\n\n''Osman'' begins with the Sultan's grasping of the situation caused by the 1621 Ottoman [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|defeat at Chocim]] and descriptions of how the era of pre-Ottoman glory of the Bulgarians, Serbs, Hungarians, Albanians and especially the Poles could be easily restored. According to the storyline, Sultan Osman dispatched Ali-pasha to the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in order to negotiate peace and Kazlar-aga to choose which Polish noblewoman would suit him best for marriage. Gunduli\u0107 describes the travels of both Ali-pasha and Kazlar-aga while paying much attention to the battle of Chocim and the enslaved Slavs that suffer under Ottoman rule. After numerous failed attempts to restore order in the empire, the army captures Osman and executes him, bringing the imprisoned Mustafa as the new sultan.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[Image:Gunduli\u0107ev san.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Gunduli\u0107's Dream'' by [[Vlaho Bukovac]]]]\nOsman was printed for the first time in Dubrovnik in 1826, with the two missing cantos being replaced by poems written by the poet [[Petar Ignjat Sorko\u010devi\u0107-Crijevi\u0107]] (1749\u20131826), a direct descendant of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 (his maternal grandmother Nikoleta Gunduli\u0107 was \u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107's daughter). Another descendant, Baron [[Vlaho Getaldi\u0107]] (grandson of Katarina Gunduli\u0107) introduced a hexameter treaty into ''Osman'' in 1865. ''Osman'' was not published in the integral edition until 1844, when the [[Illyrian movement]] chose Gunduli\u0107's oeuvre as a role model of the [[Croatian language]]. One of the leading Illyrists' men of letters, politician, linguist and poet [[Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107]], successfully completed Gunduli\u0107's ''Osman'' by composing the last two chapters, which were left unfinished upon the poet's death.\n[[File:Ivan Gunduli\u0107 - monument in Dubrovnik.jpg|thumb|Monument to Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in Dubrovnik]]\nThe monument to Gunduli\u0107 by the sculptor [[Ivan Rendi\u0107]] was [[Unveiling of the Gunduli\u0107 monument|unveiled]] on 25 July 1893 in Dubrovnik's largest square, Poljana.\n\nAt a charity concert held for the children of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina in September 1995, [[Bono]] recited at the end of the song [[Miss Sarajevo]] the famous Ivan Gunduli\u0107 verses: \u201dO liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo\u201d (\u201cOh beautiful, oh precious, oh sweet Liberty\u201d).\n\nThe [[Sun\u010danica]] is a historical opera composed by [[Boris Papandopulo]], with a libretto by [[Marko Solja\u010di\u0107]] based on Ivan Gunduli\u0107's Osman and his son \u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107, who continued Osman with the Sun\u010danica history.

Son of Francesco di Francesco Gunduli\u0107 (senator and diplomat, once the Ragusan envoy to Constantinople and councilor of the Republic to the Pope Gregory VIII) and Djiva Gradic (de Gradi). He received an excellent education. He probably studied the humanities with the Jesuit [[Silvestro Muzio]] and philosophy with [[Ridolfo Ricasoli]] and [[Camillo Camilli]] (*Siena -+1615),<ref>F.M.Appendini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2kAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA10-IA2&lpg=PA10-IA2&dq=silvestro+muzio&source=bl&ots=aGeQN7Qorx&sig=ZeJaaKsOrojT8svmjsxTybiPddk&hl=it&ei=LlbHSZaCK-TCjAe24fGUCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result Versione libera dell'Osmanide]'', Per Antonio Martecchini, Ragusa 1827</ref> who in late 1590 had been appointed ''rettore delle scuole e professore di umane lettere'' in Ragusa. After that he studied Roman law and jurisprudence in general, where he held numerous offices for the Great Council of the Republic. In 1608, when he was nineteen, he became a member of the Veliko vie\u0107e (Great Council).  Twice, in 1615 and 1619, he held the temporary function of knez (commissary or governor) of Konavle, an area southeast of the city.\n\nAt the age of thirty he married with Nicoleta Sorko\u010devi\u0107 (Sorgo)(+1644) who bore him three sons, Frano (Francesco), Matheo (Mato), \u0160i\u0161ko (Segismondo) and two daughters, Maria (Mara) Gondola and Dziva (Giovanna). [[Fran D\u017eivo Gunduli\u0107]] and [[Mato Gunduli\u0107]] (1636\u20131684) fought in the thirty-years war under [[Wallenstein]]; the youngest died on January 16, 1682, being by then the Rector of the Republic. From 1621 until his death Ivan held various offices in the city government. In 1636 he became a senator, in 1637 a judge, and in 1638 a member of the Small Council (''Malo vie\u0107e''). Had he lived a little longer \u2013 he died of an intense fever, product of an inflammation in his ribs ( ''Folio 15 Libr. Mort. N\u00b0274, Adi le Xbre 1638 Ragusa'') \u2013 he would probably have been elected knez of the Dubrovnik Republic, the highest function that was held for one month only by meritorious gentlemen at least fifty years old. His father, who died in 1624, had been ''knez'' five times, and Ivan's son [[\u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107]] later four times. Ivan Gunduli\u0107 was buried in the [[Franciscan church and monastery (Dubrovnik)|Franciscan church]] of Dubrovnik.\n[[File:Dubrovnik (76).JPG|thumb|250px|Tomb of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in the Franciscan church, Dubrovnik]]\nHe began his literary career by writing poems and staging melodramas that became popular in Dubrovnik. But Ivan published only his larger works. His earlier work, which he referred to as a \"brood of darkness\", is now lost. His first publications were in 1621, when he rewrote several of David's Psalms and wrote several religious poems. He then wrote his famous ''Suze sina razmetnoga'' ([[Tears of the Prodigal Son]]) in 1622, composed of three \"Cries\": ''Sagrie\u0161enje'' (Sin), ''Spoznanje'' (Insight) and ''Skru\u0161enje'' (Humility). In this poem Ivan presented the three basic categories of [[Christianity|Christian faith]]: sin, repentance and redemption through contrasts such as between life and death, purity and sin, and Heaven and Hell. In 1637 when [[Ferdinand II of Tuscany]] married, Gunduli\u0107 wrote a poem to honor the event, he noted that ''\"all of Slavic people (Slovinski narod) honor you on this occasion\"''.\n\n===''Dubravka''===\nGunduli\u0107's most famous play is ''[[Dubravka (drama)|Dubravka]]'', a [[pastoral]] written in 1628, where he rhapsodises on the former glory of Dubrovnik and contains some of the most famous verses in [[Croatian literature]]:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''[[Croatian language|Croatian]]'''\n\n<poem>\n       O liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo,\ndar u kom sva blaga vi\u0161nji nam Bog je do,\n   uzro\u010de istini od na\u0161e sve slave,\nuresu jedini od ove Dubrave,\n   sva srebra, sva zlata, svi ljudcki \u017eivoti\nne mogu bit plata tvoj \u010distoj lipoti.\n\n</poem>\n{{col-2}}\n'''English'''\n\n<poem>\n    Fair liberty, beloved liberty, liberty sweetly avowed,\nthou are the treasured gift that God to us endowed,\n   all our glory is thy true creation,\nto our Home thou are all the decoration,\n   no silver nor gold, not life itself could replace\nthe reward of thy pure and sublime grace.\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===''Osman''===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\nIn his greatest work, ''Osman'', Gunduli\u0107 presents the contrasts between Christianity and Islam, Europe and the Turks, West and East, and what he viewed as freedom and slavery. ''Osman'' had 20 cantos, but the 14th and the 15th were never found. Judging from the modern perspective, two approaches seem to dominate the contemporary appraisal of Gunduli\u0107's poetry: on one hand, his poetic influence has dimmed due to a change in aesthetic sensibility (Gunduli\u0107's chief literary predecessor and influence, [[Torquato Tasso]], has undergone similar reassessment, but his artistic integrity and individuality have withstood the test of time better); while Gunduli\u0107's impact in the final standardisation of the [[Croatian language]] was overwhelming.\n[[File:Dubrovnik (45).JPG|thumb|Bronze relief on the statue of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in Dubrovnik, showing a scene from the ninth canto where Sun\u010danica is taken to the Sultan's harem]]\n\n''Osman'' is firmly rooted within the rich literary tradition of the Croatian [[Baroque]] in Dubrovnik and [[Dalmatia]] and is considered as one of its apogees. By presenting the contrast of struggle between Christianity and Islam, Gunduli\u0107 continued [[Marko Maruli\u0107]]'s glorification of the fights against the invading [[Ottoman Turks]]. Besides magnifying Slavdom and the battles against the conquerors, Gunduli\u0107 described the life of the Ottoman sultan [[Osman II]]. Gunduli\u0107 constantly reminds the reader of the ''wheel of fortune'' and how the world is transient.\n\n''Osman'' begins with the Sultan's grasping of the situation caused by the 1621 Ottoman [[Battle of Khotyn (1621)|defeat at Chocim]] and descriptions of how the era of pre-Ottoman glory of the Bulgarians, Serbs, Hungarians, Albanians and especially the Poles could be easily restored. According to the storyline, Sultan Osman dispatched Ali-pasha to the [[History of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] in order to negotiate peace and Kazlar-aga to choose which Polish noblewoman would suit him best for marriage. Gunduli\u0107 describes the travels of both Ali-pasha and Kazlar-aga while paying much attention to the battle of Chocim and the enslaved Slavs that suffer under Ottoman rule. After numerous failed attempts to restore order in the empire, the army captures Osman and executes him, bringing the imprisoned Mustafa as the new sultan.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}\n[[Image:Gunduli\u0107ev san.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Gunduli\u0107's Dream'' by [[Vlaho Bukovac]]]]\nOsman was printed for the first time in Dubrovnik in 1826, with the two missing cantos being replaced by poems written by the poet [[Petar Ignjat Sorko\u010devi\u0107-Crijevi\u0107]] (1749\u20131826), a direct descendant of Ivan Gunduli\u0107 (his maternal grandmother Nikoleta Gunduli\u0107 was \u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107's daughter). Another descendant, Baron [[Vlaho Getaldi\u0107]] (grandson of Katarina Gunduli\u0107) introduced a hexameter treaty into ''Osman'' in 1865. ''Osman'' was not published in the integral edition until 1844, when the [[Illyrian movement]] chose Gunduli\u0107's oeuvre as a role model of the [[Croatian language]]. One of the leading Illyrists' men of letters, politician, linguist and poet [[Ivan Ma\u017eurani\u0107]], successfully completed Gunduli\u0107's ''Osman'' by composing the last two chapters, which were left unfinished upon the poet's death.\n[[File:Ivan Gunduli\u0107 - monument in Dubrovnik.jpg|thumb|Monument to Ivan Gunduli\u0107 in Dubrovnik]]\nThe monument to Gunduli\u0107 by the sculptor [[Ivan Rendi\u0107]] was [[Unveiling of the Gunduli\u0107 monument|unveiled]] on 25 July 1893 in Dubrovnik's largest square, Poljana.\n\nAt a charity concert held for the children of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina in September 1995, [[Bono]] recited at the end of the song [[Miss Sarajevo]] the famous Ivan Gunduli\u0107 verses: \u201dO liepa, o draga, o slatka slobodo\u201d (\u201cOh beautiful, oh precious, oh sweet Liberty\u201d).\n\nThe [[Sun\u010danica]] is a historical opera composed by [[Boris Papandopulo]], with a libretto by [[Marko Solja\u010di\u0107]] based on Ivan Gunduli\u0107's Osman and his son \u0160i\u0161mundo Gunduli\u0107, who continued Osman with the Sun\u010danica history.

Hutchins, with 71 pupils, half a mile from the current site. The building had a single storey, with a wooden extension. The school moved to its present site on Croydon Road in 1935.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], WCGS was damaged by a [[V-2|V-2 bomb]]. All windows were blown out and the roof collapsed. WCGS continued to function, with teachers and students working to rebuild the structure, and it was \"business as usual\". 52 [[old boys]] were [[killed in action]].\n\nThe 1950s to 1970s marked a period of expansion and development for the school beyond its original structure as new buildings were constructed to meet the growing number of pupils. The \"New Block\" (\"English Block\"), which contains laboratories and classrooms, was opened in 1952. It now houses all English and drama classes, as well as the dining hall. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first two years of the school were housed in classrooms at Carew Manor, half a mile away in Beddington Park. The [[Sixth Form]] block, located near the school playing fields, was completed in 1973, now containing classrooms instead.\n\nIn 1997, an old boy of WCGS, [[Chris Woodhead]] who was then [[OFSTED|HM Chief Inspector of Schools]], opened a new science block. This block contains science classrooms, laboratories and various science department administration offices. The second part of the building's development was completed in 2000.\n\nGirls were admitted to the sixth form from September 1999.<ref>[http://www.wcgs.org.uk/artman2/publish/sixth_form/A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Sixth_Form.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009120205/http://www.wcgs.org.uk/artman2/publish/sixth_form/A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Sixth_Form.shtml|date=9 October 2010}}</ref> WCGS gained [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] on 1 June 2011.\n\n=== Headteachers===\n\n* Mr W.T.

Pupils represent their houses in competitions all throughout the school year. The leading house wins the Cock House Cup.\n\nHouse colours are worn for rugby and athletics. House ties are presented to those who have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills within their house.\n\nThe House system is run by house masters - teachers who direct the houses, and house captains - senior students responsible for day-to-day house activities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Progress and attainment in the Sixth Form are also exceptional. In the latest Ofsted report from 2017, WCGS was rated 'outstanding' in all areas, including Achievement, Behaviour and Safety of pupils; Quality of teaching, learning and assessment; Personal development and Welfare; 16 to 19 study programmes; and Leadership and Management.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fluencycontent-schoolwebsite.netdna-ssl.com/FileCluster/WCGSacademyTrust/MainFolder/About-Us/Wallington-County-Grammar-School-January-2017.pdf|title=Ofsted Report 17-18th January 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWCGS was awarded \"science college\" status in 2005 for its excellence in science and mathematics. This meant extra funding for the school, which helped to further improve the standard of the school's science department. More recently, WCGS was awarded a second specialism - \"WCGS Applied Learning\".\n\nIn February 2019, the school won the ''[[Evening Standard]]'s'' Outstanding Academic Achievement Award, while its latest 'Progress 8' score places it amongst the top four percent of mainstream state-funded schools in the UK.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/grenfell-school-is-honoured-for-outstanding-achievement-at-evening-standard-school-awards-a4060846.html|title=Evening Standard School Awards 2019|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurriculars ==\n\nA fundraising concert, known as the Battle of the Bands, was held on 20 October 2006 in order to help fund WCGS' new sports hall. On this occasion, the event was competitive, and the winner was to be decided by a panel of judges. The winners, ''Dazed'', also gave an acoustic performance after the concert in memory of Jimmy Li, a pupil of Wallington County Grammar school who had died in a car crash in January 2006. In total, more than \u00a31000 was raised. The event, which is open to entries from the entire student body, has become a recurring annual event and a popular item in the school's calendar. WCGS plans to host future RAG (Raising And Giving) events to raise money for the [[Make a Wish Foundation]].\n\nThe most recent, and largest, addition to extracurricular activities is the [[sports hall]], which was opened in April 2010. The development of the hall cost \u00a31.34 million, of which \u00a3785,000 was funded by the [[Local education authority|LEA]] and the remainder was funded by the school's and PTFA's own fundraising efforts. The construction incorporates various cutting edge aesthetic features including a V-shaped roof and subtly undulating walls.<ref>[http://213.122.180.105/FASTWEB/decision.asp?AltRef=D2008/60133&ApplicationNumber=&AddressPrefix=Croydon+Road&Postcode=&CaseOfficer=&ParishName=&AreaTeam=&WardMember=&DateReceivedStart=&DateReceivedEnd=&DateDecidedStart=&DateDecidedEnd=&Locality=&AgentName=&ApplicantName=&ShowDecided=&DecisionLevel=&Sort1=DecisionDate+DESC&Sort2=DateReceived+DESC&Submit=Search Sutton Council's Online Planning D2008/60133]</ref>\n\nMany extracurricular activities are offered by WCGS including [[debating]], public speaking, [[chess]], Christian Union, Islamic Society, art, drama, music, trips abroad, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cross-country running]] and [[rugby union]]. As part of the school's drive to create more societies, newer clubs such as the Brexit Club, Puzzle Club and a Film Club have also been founded.\n\nThe main sporting achievement of WCGS was in 1999, the 1st XV Rugby team won the final of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' U18 Vase in a match played at [[Twickenham Stadium]]. The match against [[Lymm High School]] ended 16-9 in WCGS's favour.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, a Charity Bands Concert was held at the school (WCGS) to raise money for Madidima Primary School in South Africa. Seven bands formed by the school pupils performed to an audience in the WCGS school hall and a total of \u00a3545 was raised through ticket and refreshment sales.\n\nWCGS has regular trips abroad, which have included cultural tours to China and Russia; geography expeditions to Iceland and a cruise around the [[Red Sea]]. It is customary that at least two or three members of school staff lead the trips, as well as prefects or other senior members of staff.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nThe following is a list of notable former pupils educated at Wallington, known as '''Old Walcountians''':\n* [[Douglas Allen, Baron Croham]] [[Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]], senior civil servant\n*[[Neil Ardley]], musician, author\n*[[Harold Barlow]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], engineer, [[Pender Chair]] of University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 1950-1966\n*[[Herbert Barrie]] [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|MRCPCH]], paediatrician, co-founder of the [[Neonatal Society]] and the [[British Association of Perinatal Medicine]]\n*[[David Bond (journalist)|David Bond]], journalist, BBC sports editor 2009\u20132014\n*[[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron,]] composer, musician and recording artist, wrote theme music for ''Top of the Pops,'' orchestrator of [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]\n*[[Ryan Cummins]], retired county cricketer, ([[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] and [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]])\n*[[Paul Deighton|Paul Deighton, Baron Deighton]] [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], investment banker, executive of [[London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]]\n*[[Norman Long]], social anthropologist and Professor Emeritus at [[Wageningen University and Research|Wageningen University]], Netherlands\n*[[Mark Pallen]], Professor of Microbial Genomics at the [[University of East Anglia]], captain of winning team from Imperial College in University Challenge, 1995-6\n*[[John Randall (public servant)|John Randall]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], former President of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], senior civil servant\n*[[Nick Ross]], ex-presenter of [[Crimewatch]]\n*[[Malcolm Savidge]], former [[Member of Parliament]] for Aberdeen North\n*[[M.

One of a handful of [[List of schools in the London Borough of Sutton#Grammar schools|grammar schools in the borough]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200439/school_admissions/1071/applying_for_secondary_school_year_7/2|title=Directory of secondary schools in Sutton|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> it is consistently ranked as one of the top performing state schools in the country based on its GCSE and A-level results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/school/136798/wallington-county-grammar-school?tab=secondary|title=School academic performance statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nWCGS opened on 19 September 1927 on the 33rd birthday of its founding headmaster, W.T. Hutchins, with 71 pupils, half a mile from the current site. The building had a single storey, with a wooden extension. The school moved to its present site on Croydon Road in 1935.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], WCGS was damaged by a [[V-2|V-2 bomb]]. All windows were blown out and the roof collapsed. WCGS continued to function, with teachers and students working to rebuild the structure, and it was \"business as usual\". 52 [[old boys]] were [[killed in action]].\n\nThe 1950s to 1970s marked a period of expansion and development for the school beyond its original structure as new buildings were constructed to meet the growing number of pupils. The \"New Block\" (\"English Block\"), which contains laboratories and classrooms, was opened in 1952. It now houses all English and drama classes, as well as the dining hall. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first two years of the school were housed in classrooms at Carew Manor, half a mile away in Beddington Park. The [[Sixth Form]] block, located near the school playing fields, was completed in 1973, now containing classrooms instead.\n\nIn 1997, an old boy of WCGS, [[Chris Woodhead]] who was then [[OFSTED|HM Chief Inspector of Schools]], opened a new science block. This block contains science classrooms, laboratories and various science department administration offices. The second part of the building's development was completed in 2000.\n\nGirls were admitted to the sixth form from September 1999.<ref>[http://www.wcgs.org.uk/artman2/publish/sixth_form/A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Sixth_Form.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009120205/http://www.wcgs.org.uk/artman2/publish/sixth_form/A_Brief_Guide_to_the_Sixth_Form.shtml|date=9 October 2010}}</ref> WCGS gained [[Academy (English school)|academy status]] on 1 June 2011.\n\n=== Headteachers===\n\n* Mr W.T.

Pupils represent their houses in competitions all throughout the school year. The leading house wins the Cock House Cup.\n\nHouse colours are worn for rugby and athletics. House ties are presented to those who have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills within their house.\n\nThe House system is run by house masters - teachers who direct the houses, and house captains - senior students responsible for day-to-day house activities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Progress and attainment in the Sixth Form are also exceptional. In the latest Ofsted report from 2017, WCGS was rated 'outstanding' in all areas, including Achievement, Behaviour and Safety of pupils; Quality of teaching, learning and assessment; Personal development and Welfare; 16 to 19 study programmes; and Leadership and Management.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fluencycontent-schoolwebsite.netdna-ssl.com/FileCluster/WCGSacademyTrust/MainFolder/About-Us/Wallington-County-Grammar-School-January-2017.pdf|title=Ofsted Report 17-18th January 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWCGS was awarded \"science college\" status in 2005 for its excellence in science and mathematics. This meant extra funding for the school, which helped to further improve the standard of the school's science department. More recently, WCGS was awarded a second specialism - \"WCGS Applied Learning\".\n\nIn February 2019, the school won the ''[[Evening Standard]]'s'' Outstanding Academic Achievement Award, while its latest 'Progress 8' score places it amongst the top four percent of mainstream state-funded schools in the UK.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/grenfell-school-is-honoured-for-outstanding-achievement-at-evening-standard-school-awards-a4060846.html|title=Evening Standard School Awards 2019|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurriculars ==\n\nA fundraising concert, known as the Battle of the Bands, was held on 20 October 2006 in order to help fund WCGS' new sports hall. On this occasion, the event was competitive, and the winner was to be decided by a panel of judges. The winners, ''Dazed'', also gave an acoustic performance after the concert in memory of Jimmy Li, a pupil of Wallington County Grammar school who had died in a car crash in January 2006. In total, more than \u00a31000 was raised. The event, which is open to entries from the entire student body, has become a recurring annual event and a popular item in the school's calendar. WCGS plans to host future RAG (Raising And Giving) events to raise money for the [[Make a Wish Foundation]].\n\nThe most recent, and largest, addition to extracurricular activities is the [[sports hall]], which was opened in April 2010. The development of the hall cost \u00a31.34 million, of which \u00a3785,000 was funded by the [[Local education authority|LEA]] and the remainder was funded by the school's and PTFA's own fundraising efforts. The construction incorporates various cutting edge aesthetic features including a V-shaped roof and subtly undulating walls.<ref>[http://213.122.180.105/FASTWEB/decision.asp?AltRef=D2008/60133&ApplicationNumber=&AddressPrefix=Croydon+Road&Postcode=&CaseOfficer=&ParishName=&AreaTeam=&WardMember=&DateReceivedStart=&DateReceivedEnd=&DateDecidedStart=&DateDecidedEnd=&Locality=&AgentName=&ApplicantName=&ShowDecided=&DecisionLevel=&Sort1=DecisionDate+DESC&Sort2=DateReceived+DESC&Submit=Search Sutton Council's Online Planning D2008/60133]</ref>\n\nMany extracurricular activities are offered by WCGS including [[debating]], public speaking, [[chess]], Christian Union, Islamic Society, art, drama, music, trips abroad, [[cricket]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cross-country running]] and [[rugby union]]. As part of the school's drive to create more societies, newer clubs such as the Brexit Club, Puzzle Club and a Film Club have also been founded.\n\nThe main sporting achievement of WCGS was in 1999, the 1st XV Rugby team won the final of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' U18 Vase in a match played at [[Twickenham Stadium]]. The match against [[Lymm High School]] ended 16-9 in WCGS's favour.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, a Charity Bands Concert was held at the school (WCGS) to raise money for Madidima Primary School in South Africa. Seven bands formed by the school pupils performed to an audience in the WCGS school hall and a total of \u00a3545 was raised through ticket and refreshment sales.\n\nWCGS has regular trips abroad, which have included cultural tours to China and Russia; geography expeditions to Iceland and a cruise around the [[Red Sea]]. It is customary that at least two or three members of school staff lead the trips, as well as prefects or other senior members of staff.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nThe following is a list of notable former pupils educated at Wallington, known as '''Old Walcountians''':\n* [[Douglas Allen, Baron Croham]] [[Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]], senior civil servant\n*[[Neil Ardley]], musician, author\n*[[Harold Barlow]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], engineer, [[Pender Chair]] of University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, 1950-1966\n*[[Herbert Barrie]] [[Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|MRCPCH]], paediatrician, co-founder of the [[Neonatal Society]] and the [[British Association of Perinatal Medicine]]\n*[[David Bond (journalist)|David Bond]], journalist, BBC sports editor 2009-2014\n*[[John Cameron (musician)|John Cameron,]] composer, musician and recording artist, wrote theme music for ''Top of the Pops,'' orchestrator of [[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]\n*[[Ryan Cummins]], retired county cricketer, ([[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] and [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]])\n*[[Paul Deighton|Paul Deighton, Baron Deighton]] [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], investment banker, executive of [[London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]]\n*[[Norman Long]], social anthropologist and Professor Emeritus at [[Wageningen University and Research|Wageningen University]], Netherlands\n*[[Mark Pallen]], Professor of Microbial Genomics at the [[University of East Anglia]], captain of winning team from Imperial College in University Challenge, 1995-6\n*[[John Randall (public servant)|John Randall]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], former President of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], senior civil servant\n*[[Nick Ross]], ex-presenter of [[Crimewatch]]\n*[[Malcolm Savidge]], former [[Member of Parliament]] for Aberdeen North\n*[[M.

It is the first book in the trilogy known as the [[Millennium series|''Millennium'' series]], published in Sweden in 2005. \n\nBy August 2009, it had been sold to 25 countries outside Scandinavia and had been seen by more than 6 million people in the countries where it was already released. Directed by [[Niels Arden Oplev]], the film stars [[Michael Nyqvist]] and [[Noomi Rapace]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2002, [[Mikael Blomkvist]], publisher of ''Millennium'' magazine, loses a libel case involving allegations that he published about billionaire financier Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m. He is sentenced to three months in prison. [[Lisbeth Salander]], a surveillance agent and hacker, is hired by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family, to investigate Blomkvist. Vanger then hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished on [[Children's Day]] in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member.<!--- Note: This film represents the relationship between Vanger and Harriet as uncle and niece, whereas in the novel he is her great-uncle. ---> Henrik explains that his brothers- Gottfried, Richard, and Harald- were all supporters of the Nazi regime. Richard died during the war and is not a suspect for Harriet's murder. Gottfried is described as having been in the [[Hitler Youth]], an aggressive alcoholic whose marriage to Harriet and Martin's mother was cold and toxic, and the two lived separately with the children living with their father. Henrik also says that he 'never saw anyone be a worse mother than she was to Harriet'. Gottfried died one year before Harriet disappeared by accidentally drowning in a lake, and Henrik then took responsibility for Martin and Harriet. Harald is a recluse who still holds strong Nazi views and is a suspect for the murder as is Harriet's mother and all the other family members who were present on that day. Henrik also shows Blomkvist a room whose walls are covered with pressed flowers. The first ones were gifts from Harriet, and since her disappearance, a flower has arrived each year from different places around the world. Henrik believes that Harriet's killer is sending them.\n\nSalander, who was ruled mentally incompetent as a child, is appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]), after her previous guardian suffers a stroke. Bjurman makes it clear to Lisbeth that unless she co-operates with him he will make her life very difficult and threatens her with incarceration in a mental hospital. Bjurman takes over control of Lisbeth's bank account so that she has no access to her own money. Lisbeth lies to Bjurman about the nature of her work by pretending that she is just an office assistant.\n\nLisbeth is attacked by a group of drunk thugs in the subway. Although she manages to fight them off, her laptop is broken. She visits a hacker friend of hers, 'Plague', who can save the hard drive and let her use his spare PC, but Lisbeth needs to get a replacement laptop. She goes to see Bjurman who forces her to perform fellatio on him in return for the money that she needs to buy a new computer but he withholds the full amount she needs. Lisbeth calls him again the next day, but at the meeting with Bjurman, he handcuffs her to his bed, beats her, and rapes her. Lisbeth secretly recorded the encounter. She later returns to Bjurman, uses a taser to incapacitate him, ties him up, rapes him with a dildo, shows him the hidden camera footage, explains what Milton security really does, and tells him that she is taking back control of her money and life. If any 'accident' happens to Lisbeth, then the film will be released, and any threat to her will result in the same outcome. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand Bjurman's abdomen with the message \"I am a sadist pig and a rapist\".\n\nBlomkvist moves to a cottage on the Vanger estate and meets the Vanger family, including Harriet's brother Martin, who is the head of the Vanger group, and cousin Cecilia. Martin is congenial and has Blomkvist over for dinner; he and Cecelia both think that Harriet simply ran away as she was unhappy at home. \n\nInside Harriet's diary, Blomkvist finds a list of five names alongside what appear to be phone numbers. He visits retiring police inspector Morell, who informs him that his investigation team had been unable to decipher them. After viewing photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist sees Harriet's facial expression change suddenly just before she leaves and, after obtaining photographs taken from the same side of the street as her, comes to believe that Harriet may have seen her murderer that day.\n\nUsing her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander learns that the numbers in Harriet's diary are references to verses in the [[Book of Leviticus]] and emails Blomkvist anonymously. Blomkvist figures out that Salander sent the email and hires her as a research assistant. Together, Blomkvist and Salander connect all but one of the names on Harriet's list to murdered women. They are all Jewish names, which intrigues Blomkvist, as the Vanger family has a long history of antisemitism. During the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander become lovers.\n\nThey suspect Henrik's reclusive brother Harald to be the murderer, as the two other Vanger brothers had already died by the time that Harriet disappeared. Salander searches through Vanger's business records to trace Harald to the crime scenes, while Blomkvist breaks into Harald's house, believing it to be unoccupied. He discovers many Nazi texts and memorabilia amid the wreckage of the interior of the house which has been left to decay. When Harald attacks Blomkvist, Martin appears and saves him. Harald insults Martin for stopping him from shooting Blomkvist. Martin escorts Blomkvist to his home, where Blomkvist reveals what he and Salander have uncovered. Martin says that he'll call the police, but instead he drugs Blomkvist. Salander's search of the company accounts points to Martin and his late father, Gottfried, as having been jointly responsible for the murders. She returns to the cottage to find Blomkvist missing.\n\nBlomkvist wakes to find himself bound in Martin's cellar. Martin explains that Gottfried began teaching him to rape, torture, and kill as a teenager, and Martin boasts about raping and murdering women for decades since his father's death. However, he denies killing Harriet, insisting that she disappeared. He also says that Gottfried was too theatrical and that leaving the bodies out to be found was a step too far as it drew too much attention. As Martin is in the process of hanging Blomkvist, Salander appears and attacks Martin with a golf club. While she frees Blomkvist, Martin flees in his car. Salander gives chase on her motorcycle. When Martin drives off the road, Salander finds him still alive but trapped in the vehicle. As the car goes up in flames, she makes no attempt to save him.\n\nBlomkvist realises that Cecilia's late sister Anita was the near-double of Harriet and that some of the film taken on the day of Harriet's disappearance shows Anita, not Harriet as previously thought. Blomkvist and Salander discover that Harriet has been using Anita's name and is still alive in Australia. Blomkvist flies there to look for her, and he persuades her to return to Sweden, where she is reunited with her uncle. Harriet explains the truth about her disappearance: that her father and her brother had repeatedly raped her; that she killed her father by drowning him, which was witnessed by Martin; and that her cousin Anita had smuggled her away from the island after Martin returned from school. Harriet notes that her brother was harsher to her than her father and that she knew that remaining on the island would lead to her death at her brother's hands. As a way of letting Henrik know that she was alive, Harriet sent the pressed flowers as a signal that she was out there in the world. She apologises for frightening Henrik as he had misinterpreted these messages but Henrik reassures her by explaining that thanks to her messages the truth has come out. \n\nSalander's mother, living in a nursing home, apologises for not choosing a \"better papa\" for her. Salander then visits Blomkvist in prison and gives him new information on the Wennerstr\u00f6m case. From prison, Blomkvist publishes a new story on Wennerstr\u00f6m in ''Millennium'' which ruins Wennerstr\u00f6m and makes the magazine a national sensation. Wennerstr\u00f6m is then found dead presumably by suicide. His offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands is raided, and the police suspect a young woman caught on CCTV, whom Blomkvist recognises as Salander in disguise. The film ends with Salander, dressed in disguise as she exits her car, walking along a sunny beach promenade.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as [[Mikael Blomkvist]]\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]]\n* [[Lena Endre]] as Erika Berger\n* [[Sven-Bertil Taube]] as Henrik Vanger\n* [[Peter Haber]] as Martin Vanger\n* [[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Nils Bjurman\n* [[Marika Lagercrantz]] as Cecilia Vanger\n* [[Ingvar Hirdwall]] as Dirch Frode\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Granath]] as Gustav Morell\n* [[Ewa Fr\u00f6ling]] as Harriet Vanger\n* Michalis Koutsogiannakis as Dragan Armansky\n* [[Annika Hallin]] as Annika Giannini\n* [[Tomas K\u00f6hler]] as \"Plague\"\n* [[Gunnel Lindblom]] as Isabella Vanger\n* [[G\u00f6sta Bredefeldt]] as Harald Vanger\n* [[Stefan Sauk]] as Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m\n* [[Jacob Ericksson]] as Christer Malm\n* [[Julia Sporre]] as young Harriet Vanger\n* [[Tehilla Blad]] as young Lisbeth Salander\n* [[Sofia Ledarp]] as Malin Eriksson\n* [[David Dencik]] as Janne Dahlman\n* [[Reuben Sallmander]] as Enrico Giannini\n* [[Alexandra Hummingson]] as journalist \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'' was well received by critics.

Bjurman makes it clear to Lisbeth that unless she co-operates with him he will make her life very difficult and threatens her with incarceration in a mental hospital. Bjurman takes over control of Lisbeth's bank account so that she has no access to her own money. Lisbeth lies to Bjurman about the nature of her work by pretending that she is just an office assistant.\n\nLisbeth is attacked by a group of drunk thugs in the subway. Although she manages to fight them off, her laptop is broken. She visits a hacker friend of hers, 'Plague', who can save the hard drive and let her use his spare PC, but Lisbeth needs to get a replacement laptop. She goes to see Bjurman who forces her to perform fellatio on him in return for the money that she needs to buy a new computer but he withholds the full amount she needs. Lisbeth calls him again the next day, but at the meeting with Bjurman, he handcuffs her to his bed, beats her, and rapes her. Lisbeth secretly recorded the encounter. She later returns to Bjurman, uses a taser to incapacitate him, ties him up, rapes him with a dildo, shows him the hidden camera footage, explains what Milton security really does, and tells him that she is taking back control of her money and life. If any 'accident' happens to Lisbeth, then the film will be released, and any threat to her will result in the same outcome. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand Bjurman's abdomen with the message \"I am a sadist pig and a rapist\".\n\nBlomkvist moves to a cottage on the Vanger estate and meets the Vanger family, including Harriet's brother Martin, who is the head of the Vanger group, and cousin Cecilia. Martin is congenial and has Blomkvist over for dinner; he and Cecelia both think that Harriet simply ran away as she was unhappy at home. \n\nInside Harriet's diary, Blomkvist finds a list of five names alongside what appear to be phone numbers. He visits retiring police inspector Morell, who informs him that his investigation team had been unable to decipher them. After viewing photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist sees Harriet's facial expression change suddenly just before she leaves and, after obtaining photographs taken from the same side of the street as her, comes to believe that Harriet may have seen her murderer that day.\n\nUsing her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander learns that the numbers in Harriet's diary are references to verses in the [[Book of Leviticus]] and emails Blomkvist anonymously. Blomkvist figures out that Salander sent the email and hires her as a research assistant. Together, Blomkvist and Salander connect all but one of the names on Harriet's list to murdered women. They are all Jewish names, which intrigues Blomkvist, as the Vanger family has a long history of antisemitism. During the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander become lovers.\n\nThey suspect Henrik's reclusive brother Harald to be the murderer, as the two other Vanger brothers had already died by the time that Harriet disappeared. Salander searches through Vanger's business records to trace Harald to the crime scenes, while Blomkvist breaks into Harald's house, believing it to be unoccupied. He discovers many Nazi texts and memorabilia amid the wreckage of the interior of the house which has been left to decay. When Harald attacks Blomkvist, Martin appears and saves him. Harald insults Martin for stopping him from shooting Blomkvist. Martin escorts Blomkvist to his home, where Blomkvist reveals what he and Salander have uncovered. Martin says that he'll call the police, but instead he drugs Blomkvist. Salander's search of the company accounts points to Martin and his late father, Gottfried, as having been jointly responsible for the murders. She returns to the cottage to find Blomkvist missing.\n\nBlomkvist wakes to find himself bound in Martin's cellar. Martin explains that Gottfried began teaching him to rape, torture, and kill as a teenager, and Martin boasts about raping and murdering women for decades since his father's death. However, he denies killing Harriet, insisting that she disappeared. He also says that Gottfried was too theatrical and that leaving the bodies out to be found was a step too far as it drew too much attention. As Martin is in the process of hanging Blomkvist, Salander appears and attacks Martin with a golf club. While she frees Blomkvist, Martin flees in his car. Salander gives chase on her motorcycle. When Martin drives off the road, Salander finds him still alive but trapped in the vehicle. As the car goes up in flames, she makes no attempt to save him.\n\nBlomkvist realises that Cecilia's late sister Anita was the near-double of Harriet and that some of the film taken on the day of Harriet's disappearance shows Anita, not Harriet as previously thought. Blomkvist and Salander discover that Harriet has been using Anita's name and is still alive in Australia. Blomkvist flies there to look for her, and he persuades her to return to Sweden, where she is reunited with her uncle. Harriet explains the truth about her disappearance: that her father and her brother had repeatedly raped her; that she killed her father by drowning him, which was witnessed by Martin; and that her cousin Anita had smuggled her away from the island after Martin returned from school. Harriet notes that her brother was harsher to her than her father and that she knew that remaining on the island would lead to her death at her brother's hands. As a way of letting Henrik know that she was alive, Harriet sent the pressed flowers as a signal that she was out there in the world. She apologises for frightening Henrik as he had misinterpreted these messages but Henrik reassures her by explaining that thanks to her messages the truth has come out. \n\nSalander's mother, living in a nursing home, apologises for not choosing a \"better papa\" for her. Salander then visits Blomkvist in prison and gives him new information on the Wennerstr\u00f6m case. From prison, Blomkvist publishes a new story on Wennerstr\u00f6m in ''Millennium'' which ruins Wennerstr\u00f6m and makes the magazine a national sensation. Wennerstr\u00f6m is then found dead presumably by suicide. His offshore bank account in the Cayman Islands is raided, and the police suspect a young woman caught on CCTV, whom Blomkvist recognises as Salander in disguise. The film ends with Salander, dressed in disguise as she exits her car, walking along a sunny beach promenade.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Michael Nyqvist]] as [[Mikael Blomkvist]]\n* [[Noomi Rapace]] as [[Lisbeth Salander]]\n* [[Lena Endre]] as Erika Berger\n* [[Sven-Bertil Taube]] as Henrik Vanger\n* [[Peter Haber]] as Martin Vanger\n* [[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Nils Bjurman\n* [[Marika Lagercrantz]] as Cecilia Vanger\n* [[Ingvar Hirdwall]] as Dirch Frode\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Granath]] as Gustav Morell\n* [[Ewa Fr\u00f6ling]] as Harriet Vanger\n* Michalis Koutsogiannakis as Dragan Armansky\n* [[Annika Hallin]] as Annika Giannini\n* [[Tomas K\u00f6hler]] as \"Plague\"\n* [[Gunnel Lindblom]] as Isabella Vanger\n* [[G\u00f6sta Bredefeldt]] as Harald Vanger\n* [[Stefan Sauk]] as Hans-Erik Wennerstr\u00f6m\n* [[Jacob Ericksson]] as Christer Malm\n* [[Julia Sporre]] as young Harriet Vanger\n* [[Tehilla Blad]] as young Lisbeth Salander\n* [[Sofia Ledarp]] as Malin Eriksson\n* [[David Dencik]] as Janne Dahlman\n* [[Reuben Sallmander]] as Enrico Giannini\n* [[Alexandra Hummingson]] as journalist \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical response===\n''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'' was well received by critics.
