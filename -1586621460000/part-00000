{"title_page": "Autonomous building", "text_new": "{{short description|Building desgined to be independent from public infrastructure}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n{{Anti-consumerism|Theories}}\n\nAn '''autonomous building''' is a building designed to be operated independently from [[infrastructure|infrastructural]] support services such as the [[electric power]] grid, [[gas grid]], municipal water systems, [[sewage treatment]] systems, [[storm drain]]s, communication services, and in some cases, [[public road]]s.\n\nAdvocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced [[environmental impact]]s, increased security, and lower [[costs of ownership]]. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. For example, Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised.\n\nAs of 2018, most research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.\n\nIn 2002, British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] said that\n\n<blockquote>It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a \"house with no bills\" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.<ref>{{cite book |last= Vale |first= Brenda and Robert |authorlink= Brenda and Robert Vale |title= The New Autonomous House|year= 2000|publisher= Thames & Hudson Ltd|location= London |isbn=0-500-34176-1 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1970s, groups of activists and engineers were inspired by the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. In the [[US]] a group calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of \"[[bioshelter]]\" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the \"New Alchemy Institute\".<ref>[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html \"New Alchemy Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.</ref> The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.\n\n[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]\n\nThe 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].\n\n1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.\n\n==Advantages==\n\nAs an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.\n\nAutonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.\n\nAutonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.\n\nAn autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nFirst and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.\n\nLiving within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.\n\nAn autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.\n\n==Systems==\nThis section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]\n[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]\n\nThere are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.\n\n[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.\n\nThe classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[Sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.\n\nHowever drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.\n\nIn regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|title=WHO &#124; Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nMost [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.\n\nIn many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref> To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a \"roof cleaner\" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], through [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.\n\nIn the classic Roman house (\"Domus\"), household water was provided from a cistern (the \"impluvium\"), which was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward-facing roof-opening (the \"compluvium\"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nModern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.\n\nReducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.\n\nIt can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.\n\n[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).\n\nNew technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. [[Watermaker]]s are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.\n\n===Sewage===\n{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}\n\n====Resource====\n\n[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]\n[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of \"[[humanure]]\" for growing food.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref> The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.<ref>See [[composting toilet]] for references.</ref>\n\nSome home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].\n\nElectric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission. Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.\n\nA big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.\n\n====Waste====\n\nSewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.\n\nThe standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.\n\nSeptic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.\n\nHowever, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.\n\nComposting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.\n\nIncinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.\n\nTraditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.\n\n===Storm drains===\n\nDrainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.\n\nTypically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.\n\nAutonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:\n\nIf a water-absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.<ref>Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], \"Natural Capitalism,\" ch. 5, p. 83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett</ref> One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.\n\nA [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.\n\n===Electricity===\n[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]\n[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]\n\n{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.<ref>Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)</ref> There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.\n\nUsing a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.\n\nHowever, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100-foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.\n\nThe main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33-foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.<ref name=\"Gipe\">Paul Gipe, \"Wind Power for Home and Business\"</ref>\n\nSome sites have access to a stream with a change in elevation. These sites can use [[Micro hydro|small hydropower systems]] to generate electricity. If the difference in elevation is above 30 metres (100 feet), and the stream runs in all seasons, this can provide continuous power with a small, inexpensive installation. Lower changes of elevation require larger installations or dams, and can be less efficient. Clogging at the turbine intake can be a practical problem. The usual solution is a small pool and waterfall (a penstock) to carry away floating debris. Another solution is to utilize a turbine that resists debris, such as a [[Gorlov helical turbine]] or [[Ossberger turbine]].\n\nDuring times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).<ref name=\"Gipe\"/>\n\nA grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).\n\nIn areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.<ref>[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref><ref>[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref>\n\nRecent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a \"[[regenerative fuel cell]]\", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.\n\n[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.\n\n[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.\n\n===Heating===\n[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]\n\nMost autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].\n\n[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.\n\nThe basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.\n\nA recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system \"[[Annualized geo solar]] heating\" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.<ref name=\"Stephens\">Stephens, Don. September 2005. [http://www.greenershelter.com/TokyoPaper.pdf \"'Annualized Geo-Solar Heating' as a Sustainable Residential-scale Solution for Temperate Climates with Less than Ideal Daily Heating Season Solar Availability.\"] (\"Requested Paper for the Global Sustainable Building Conference 2005, Tokyo, Japan\"). Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.</ref> It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.\n\nIn annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.\n\nA more modest \"daily solar\" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes, in particular, bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it through a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.\n\nIn all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heating|water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.\n\n[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Stephens\"/> in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.\n\nRounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.\n\nAn increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].<ref>[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHouses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.\n\nElectric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.\n\n===Water heating===\n\n{{Further|Solar hot water}}\n\n[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.\n\nCurrent practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[Tankless water heater|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.\n\n[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.\n\nThe basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.\n\nHeat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50\u201375% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.\nSome authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.\n\n===Cooling===\n\nAnnualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.\n\nLess dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.\n\nAnother trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.\n\nIf a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the \"dome effect.\"  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light-colored dome induces a local vertical heat-driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 \u00b0C}} ({{nowrap|15 \u00b0F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.\n\nRefrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an \"[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]\". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.\n\nCogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].\n\nA truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.\n\nA similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low-temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (28&nbsp;\u00b0C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.\n\nIf enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].\n\n===Food production===\n\nFood production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.<ref name=\"publications\">[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217004825/http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html |date=February 17, 2010 }}.

Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of [[green building]], not independence per se (see below). [[Off-the-grid|Off-grid]] buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. For example, Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised.\n\nAs of 2018, most research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.\n\nIn 2002, British architects [[Brenda and Robert Vale]] said that\n\n<blockquote>It is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques.

In the [[US]] a group calling themselves the [[New Alchemists]] were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional [[construction]] techniques, they designed a series of \"[[bioshelter]]\" projects, the most famous of which was the [[Ark Bioshelter]] community for [[Prince Edward Island]]. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind based water pumping and electricity, and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, [[fish farming|fish]] tanks raising [[tilapia]] for [[protein]], a [[greenhouse]] watered with fish water and a closed loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the \"New Alchemy Institute\".<ref>[http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html \"New Alchemy Institute\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818015757/http://www.vsb.cape.com/~nature/greencenter/newalchemy.html |date=2006-08-18 }} (Website). ''The Green Center''. Retrieved on 2010-01-10.</ref> The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.\n\n[[Image:PHOENIXBATH.jpg|left|thumb|The bathroom of an [[Earthship]], featuring a recycled [[bottle wall]]]]\n\nThe 1990s saw the development of [[Earthship]]s, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by [[Mike Reynolds (architect)|Mike Reynolds]]. The building material is [[tire]]s filled with [[soil|earth]]. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see [[earth sheltering]]). [[Berm]]s are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally [[blackwater (waste)|black water]] is recycled again for more plant watering. The [[cistern]]s are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from [[solar energy|solar power]].\n\n1990s architects such as [[William McDonough]] and [[Ken Yeang]] applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building ([[ING Group|ING's]] [[Amsterdam]] headquarters) in the [[Netherlands]] was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.\n\n==Advantages==\n\nAs an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.\n\nAutonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.\n\nAutonomous buildings are usually [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.\n\nAn autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of [[sustainability]] through the use of [[renewable energy]] and other renewable resources, producing no more [[greenhouse gas]]es than they consume, and other measures.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\nFirst and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.\n\nLiving within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.\n\nAn autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.\n\n==Systems==\nThis section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.\n\n===Water===\n[[File:Ceres rainwater tank 2 Pengo.jpg|thumb|right|A domestic [[rainwater harvesting]] system]]\n[[Image:Unterirdische Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|A concrete under-floor cistern being installed.]]\n\nThere are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.\n\n[[Greywater]] systems reuse drained wash water to flush [[toilet]]s or to water lawns and [[garden]]s. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary [[plumbing]]. Some builders are installing [[waterless urinal]]s and even [[composting toilet]]s that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.\n\nThe classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a [[water well|well]]. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The [[Sono arsenic filter]] eliminates unhealthy [[arsenic]] in well water.\n\nHowever drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas.  It can also be expensive.\n\nIn regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use [[rainwater harvesting]], with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment.  If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutconsensus/en/|title=WHO &#124; Nutrient minerals in drinking-water and the potential health consequences of consumption of demineralized and remineralized and altered mineral content drinking-water: Consensus of the meeting<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>\n\nMost [[desert]] and [[temperate]] climates get at least {{convert|250|mm|in}} of [[rain]] per year. This means that a typical one-story [[house]] with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a [[cistern]] of {{convert|30|m3|USgal}}. Many areas average {{convert|13|mm|in}} of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as {{convert|10|m3|USgal}}.\n\nIn many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517155419/http://www.uaf.edu/ces/publications/freepubs/HCM-01557.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cistern Design, University of Alaska, referenced 2007-12-27|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref> To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a \"roof cleaner\" tank that diverts the first 40 liters.  Cistern water is usually [[water chlorination|chlorinated]], though [[reverse osmosis]] systems provide even better quality drinking water.\n\nIn the classic Roman house (\"Domus\"), household water was provided from a cistern (the \"impluvium\"), that was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward facing roof-opening (the \"compluvium\"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jefferey|title=The Roman House (Domus)|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/beginners-guide-rome/a/roman-domestic-architecture-domus|website=Khan Academy|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Vitruvius|translator-last1=Morgan|translator-first1=Morris Hickey|title=The Ten Books of Architecture|date=1914|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=6.3|url=http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/Vitruvius__the_Ten_Books_on_Architecture.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nModern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks.  Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent.  The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.\n\nReducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below {{convert|10|USgal|L}} per person per day, so that in a [[drought]] a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.\n\nIt can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a [[heat pump]] or [[HVAC|air conditioning]] system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.\n\n[[Solar still]]s can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency [[multiple effect humidification]] designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).\n\nNew technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]] can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Water makers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into [[drinking water|potable water]] and [[brine]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.\n\n===Sewage===\n{{see also|Anaerobic digestion}}\n\n====Resource====\n\n[[Image:Nature Loo Waterless Composting Toilet Pedestal.jpg|thumb|right|A composting toilet]]\n[[Composting toilet]]s use bacteria to decompose human [[feces]] into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste.  Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of \"[[humanure]]\" for growing food.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure|last= Jenkins|first=J.C. |year= 2005|publisher= Joseph Jenkins, Inc.; 3rd edition|location=Grove City, PA |isbn= 978-0-9644258-3-5|pages=255 |url=http://www.humanurehandbook.com |accessdate=24 February 2019}}</ref> The risk is microbial and viral contamination.  In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months.  To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.<ref>See [[composting toilet]] for references.</ref>\n\nSome home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free [[reclaimed water]] can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large [[aquarium]].\n\nElectric [[incinerating toilet]]s turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.\n\n[[NASA]]'s [[bioreactor]] is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned [[Mars]] mission. Another method is NASA's [[urine]]-to-water [[distill]]ation system.\n\nA big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.\n\n====Waste====\n\nSewage handling is essential for public health. Many [[disease]]s are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.\n\nThe standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a [[septic tank]]. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary [[sewage treatment]]. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by [[anaerobic digestion]], and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.\n\nSeptic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a [[Cesspool emptier|vacuum truck]] to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.\n\nHowever, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.\n\nComposting or [[packaging toilet]]s make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.\n\nIncinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.\n\nTraditional methods of sewage handling include [[pit toilet]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[outhouse]]s. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.\n\n===Storm drains===\n\nDrainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.\n\nTypically, elaborate, capital-intensive [[storm sewer]] networks are engineered to deal with [[stormwater]]. In some cities, such as the [[Victorian era]] London sewers or much of the old City of [[Toronto]], the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.\n\nAutonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:\n\nIf a water absorbing [[swale (geographical feature)|swale]] for each yard is combined with permeable [[concrete]] streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains.<ref>Swales replacing drains: [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]] and [[Hunter Lovins]], \"Natural Capitalism,\" ch. 5, pp83.  The cited development is Village Homes, Davis, California, built in the 1970s by Michael and Judy Corbett</ref> One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.\n\nA [[green roof]] captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.\n\n===Electricity===\n[[File:Green Building by Terry Farrel and Partners 394640345.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbine on the roof in Manchester, UK]]\n[[Image:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|right|A PV-solar system]]\n\n{{Further|Zero emissions|Zero-energy building}}Since electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. [[LED light]]s, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient.<ref>Sunfrost rates {{convert|15|cuft|L|abbr=on}}. refrigerators at [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 0.27 kWh/day] (2007-12-27), while Dometic brand (formerly Servel brand) gas refrigerators cool only {{convert|8|cuft}} for [http://www.sunfrost.com/extreme_efficiency.html 325 W continuous] (i.e. 7.8 kWh/day) ALternatively, they use about {{convert|8|USgal}} of LP gas per month, which in most places is more expensive than the equivalent electricity.(2007-12-27)</ref> There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the [[Sun Frost]] company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market [[energy star]]-rated refrigerator.\n\nUsing a solar roof, [[solar cell]]s can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.\n\nHowever, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself. In stormy or windy climates, [[wind turbine|wind generator]]s can replace or supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100 foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.\n\nThe main advantage of [[wind power]] is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the [[Great Plains]] of the United States, a 10-metre (33 foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.<ref name=\"Gipe\">Paul Gipe, \"Wind Power for Home and Business\"</ref>\n\nSome sites have access to a stream with a change in elevation. These sites can use [[Micro hydro|small hydropower systems]] to generate electricity. If the difference in elevation is above 30 metres (100 feet), and the stream runs in all seasons, this can provide continuous power with a small, inexpensive installation. Lower changes of elevation require larger installations or dams, and can be less efficient. Clogging at the turbine intake can be a practical problem. The usual solution is a small pool and waterfall (a penstock) to carry away floating debris. Another solution is to utilize a turbine that resists debris, such as a [[Gorlov helical turbine]] or [[Ossberger turbine]].\n\nDuring times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the [[distributed generation|electric power grid]] and operating the power system with [[net metering]]. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).<ref name=\"Gipe\"/>\n\nA grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using [[single-wire earth return]] systems (for example, the [[MALT (electricity system)|MALT]]-system).\n\nIn areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or sometimes [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.<ref>[http://www.eaton.com Eaton power]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref><ref>[http://www.KohlerSmartPower.com Kohler Generators]; see the specifications and manuals.  Referenced 2007-12-27</ref>\n\nRecent advances in [[magnetic levitation|passively stable magnetic bearings]] may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a [[flywheel]] in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's [[Ballard Power Systems]] are also working to develop a \"[[regenerative fuel cell]]\", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.\n\n[[Earth battery|Earth batteries]] tap electric currents in the earth called [[telluric current]]. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.\n\n[[Microbial fuel cell]]s and [[thermoelectric generator]]s<ref>{{cite web|title=Biolite Portable Stoves|url=https://www.bioliteenergy.com/collections/stoves|website=bioliteenergy.com|publisher=Biolite|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Firebee:Charge your USB Device!|url=http://firebeecharger.com/|website=firebeecharger.com|publisher=Firebee|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.\n\n===Heating===\n[[Image:Active Solar Water Heater Diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Schematic of an active solar heating system]]\n\nMost autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are [[trombe wall]]s and other technologies as [[Steve Baer|skylights]].\n\n[[passive solar building design|Passive solar heating]] can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.\n\nThe basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], north in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]), and the building must incorporate [[thermal mass]] to keep it warm in the night.\n\nA recent, somewhat experimental [[solar heating]] system \"[[Annualized geo solar]] heating\" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter.<ref name=\"Stephens\">Stephens, Don.

Greenershelter.org website. Retrieved on 2007-09-16.</ref> It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with {{nowrap|6 m}} skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.\n\nIn annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], for example, [[straw-bale construction]]. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.\n\nA more modest \"daily solar\" design is very practical.  For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the [[passive house|Passivhaus]] building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern [[krypton]]- or [[argon]]-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required [[thermal mass]]. Passivhaus building codes in particular bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it though a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.\n\nIn all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small [[heat pump]], which also provides [[air conditioning]], or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the [[water heating|water heater]].  Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.\n\n[[Earth sheltering]] and [[windbreak]]s can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on}} in North Dakota to {{convert|26|C|F|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"Stephens\"/> in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.\n\nRounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.\n\nAn increasing number of commercial buildings use a [[combined cycle]] with [[cogeneration]] to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas [[reciprocating engine]], [[gas turbine]] or [[stirling engine|stirling]] [[electric generator]].<ref>[http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf Capstone Microturbine White-Paper (PDF) Retrieved on 2007-12-28.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813123637/http://www.microturbine.com/_docs/WCEMC04.pdf |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nHouses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a [[wood stove]], or heat and power from [[diesel fuel]] or [[bottled gas]], regardless of their other heating mechanisms.\n\nElectric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.\n\n===Water heating===\n\n{{Further|Solar hot water}}\n\n[[Hot water heat recycling]] units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water.  They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.\n\nCurrent practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a [[Tankless water heater|thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater]], so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.\n\n[[Solar water heater]]s can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.\n\nThe basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are [[vacuum]]- insulated, acting something like large [[thermos]] bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.\n\n[[Cogeneration]] systems produce hot water from [[waste heat]].  They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.\n\nHeat recycling, [[cogeneration]] and solar pre-heating can save 50-75% of the gas otherwise used.  Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.\nSome authorities advocate replacing [[bottled gas]] or [[natural gas]] with [[biogas]]. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site.  The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough [[methane]] for anything more than small amounts of cooking.\n\n===Cooling===\n\nAnnualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend {{convert|6|m|ft}} from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.\n\nLess dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.\n\nAnother trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a [[whole-house fan]] and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.\n\nIf a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the \"dome effect.\"  Many installations have reported that a reflective or light colored dome induces a local vertical heat driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as {{nowrap|8 \u00b0C}} ({{nowrap|15 \u00b0F}}) between the inside of the dome and the outside. [[Buckminster Fuller]] discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a [[grain silo]], and adapted his [[Dymaxion house]] and [[geodesic dome]]s to use it.\n\nRefrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an \"[[absorptive refrigeration|absorptive chiller]]\". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.\n\nCogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or [[stirling engine]]s powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an [[absorptive chiller]].\n\nA truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's [[diesel exhaust]] was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic [[ammonia]] gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.\n\nA similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50&nbsp;\u00b0F (28&nbsp;\u00b0C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.\n\nIf enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a [[heat pump]].\n\n===Food production===\n\nFood production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.<ref name=\"publications\">[http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html Publications list of the New Alchemy Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217004825/http://nature.my.cape.com/greencenter/pubonline.html |date=February 17, 2010 }}.

[[NATO]] [[military intelligence]] had already given it the [[NATO reporting name|reporting name]] ''STEEL WORK'' or ''STEEL YARD''. While the amateur radio community was well aware of the system, this theory was not publicly confirmed until after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Genesis===\nThe Soviets had been working on [[early warning radar]] for their [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been line-of-sight systems that were useful for rapid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences time to study the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning [[satellite]] network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.\n\nThe first experimental system, Duga, was built outside [[Mykolaiv]] in [[Ukraine]], successfully detecting rocket launches from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] at 2,500 kilometers. This was followed by the prototype Duga, built on the same site, which was able to track launches from the far east and submarines in the Pacific Ocean as the missiles flew towards [[Novaya Zemlya]]. Both of these radar systems were aimed east and were fairly low power, but with the concept proven, work began on an operational system. The new Duga-1 systems used a transmitter and receiver separated by about 60&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"PodvigBook\">{{Cite book\n | last = Bukharin\n | first = Oleg\n | authorlink =\n | editor = Pavel Podvig\n | title = Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces\n | year = 2001\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts\n |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n | filename    = Woodpecker.ogg\n | title       = Woodpecker\n | description = Woodpecker on shortwave radio interfering with [[WWVH]], November 2, 1984.

Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].<ref name=mystery/><ref name=week/> Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this \"the Russian Woodpecker\". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but it was probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.\n\n[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and [[NATO]] quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present-day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being variously located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.<ref name=mystery/>\n\nThe radar system was given the code 5\u041d32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.<ref name=week>{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}</ref> Unknown to civilian observers at the time, NATO was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.\n\n===NATO Reporting Name===\nThe NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any \"official\" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, establishing the true name will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.<ref name=\"The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition\">{{Cite book\n | last = \n | first = \n | authorlink =\n | editor = \n | title = The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition\n | year = 1989\n | publisher = Cardiff Publishing\n | location = Englewood, Colorado, USA\n }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Civilian identification===\nEven from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],<ref name=mystery>{{Cite journal\n | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests\n | journal= Wireless World\n | pages = 53\n | date = February 1977\n | url = http://www.mysterysignals.signalshed.com/Wpecker2.html\n | accessdate = 2019-04-08\n}}</ref> and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.\n\nAs more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 \u03bcs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title = Letter from J. P. Martinez\n | author =  J.P. Martinez\n | journal= Wireless World\n | pages = 89\n | date = April 1982\n | url = http://www.mysterysignals.signalshed.com/Wpecker6.html\n | accessdate = 2019-04-08\n}}</ref> This sequence is usable for a 100&nbsp;\u03bcs chirped pulse amplification system, giving a resolution of 15&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) (the distance light travels in 50&nbsp;\u03bcs). When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.\n\nIn 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.\n* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&nbsp;Hz, 16&nbsp;Hz and 20&nbsp;Hz.\n* The most common rate was 10&nbsp;Hz, while the 16&nbsp;Hz and 20&nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.\n* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Jamming the Woodpecker===\n[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]\n\nTo combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' Some hams informally attempted to jam the woodpecker by tapping a microphone with a pencil emulating the woodpecker's signal while transmitting on the ham voice subbands. | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}</ref>  Core group members would frame the \"Official Practice Target\" in their radio shacks.<ref>{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.mysterysignals.signalshed.com/Wpecker3.html }}</ref>\n\n===Disappearance===\nStarting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play.{{according to|date=March 2020}} Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.\n\nAccording to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands and has been used by radio amateurs visiting the area using their own portable radio equipment.\n\n== Locations ==\n{{Location map many | Russia Khabarovsk Krai\n| AlternativeMap = Russia Khabarovsk Krai location map.svg\n| width = 180\n| float = right\n| caption = Location of Duga-2 in Khabarovsk Krai\n| label = Transmitter| label_size = 90\n| pos = right\n| lat_deg= 50 | lat_min=23 | lat_sec=07.98 | lat_dir=N\n| lon_deg= 137 | lon_min=19 | lon_sec=41.87 | lon_dir=E\n| label2 = Receiver| label2_size = 90\n| pos2 = left\n| lat2_deg= 50 | lat_min2=53 | lat_sec2=34.66 | lat_dir2=N\n| lon2_deg= 136 | lon_min2=50 | lon_sec2=12.38 | lon_dir2=E\n}}\n\nThe original Duga was the first experimental system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A.

Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.\n\nThe original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2.  The receiver is located at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. \n\nDuga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&nbsp;km north of the city.\n\n== Appearances in media ==\nThe Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game features many actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.\n\n[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].\n\nIn ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map \"Grid\" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.\n\nThe 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.\n\nThe Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.<ref>[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]</ref>  \n\nThe Duga radar is also featured in the films of the [[Divergent trilogy|''Divergent'' series]], where it was used as the giant wall and fence surrounding the main city. In wide shots, its structure was used to create CGI images of the superstructure and several close-up scenes were shot directly at its location.\n\nA Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.\n\nThe Duga radar is heavily featured in the Virtual reality game \"Proze : Enlightenment\" a suspense/puzzle game with the theory that the radar is being used by mind controlling experiments during the 1950-60s\nThe game actually starts with the player ascending one of the pylons on a maintenance lift.<ref>http://signsine.com/proze-vr/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cobra Mist]]\n* [[Jindalee Operational Radar Network]], a similar Australian system.\n* The [[Montauk Project]] \n* [[Numbers station]]\n* [[UVB-76|The Buzzer]]\n* [[Container radar|Container (29B6) radar]], new Russian OTH Radar with similar radio interference to the Duga.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal|last=Headrick|first=James M.|title=Looking over the horizon (HF radar)|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=1 July 1990|volume=27|issue=7|pages=36\u201339|doi=10.1109/6.58421}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Headrick|first=James M.|author2=Skolnik, Merrill I.|title=Over-the-Horizon radar in the HF band|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=1 January 1974|volume=62|issue=6|pages=664\u2013673|doi=10.1109/PROC.1974.9506|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/391ad6e3748a070f41aa42a37735d0a594c71eb3}}\n* Headrick, James M., Ch. 24: \"HF over-the-horizon radar,\" in: Radar Handbook, 2nd ed., Merrill I.

Transmission power on some Woodpecker transmitters was estimated to be as high as 10&nbsp;MW [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]].<ref name=mystery/><ref name=week/> Even prior to 1976, a similar 'woodpecker' interference is remembered by radio amateurs occurring in the [[High frequency|high frequencies]]. As early as 1963, or before, radio amateurs were calling this \"the Russian Woodpecker\". Little is apparently known about the power levels or Russian designation but it was probably a forerunner of the Duga radar systems. It was also speculated at that time, at least among radio amateurs, that this was an over-the-horizon radar.\n\n[[Triangulation]] by both amateur radio hobbyists and [[NATO]] quickly revealed the signals came from a location in present-day [[Ukraine]], at the time called [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (part of [[USSR]]). Confusion due to small differences in the reports being made from various sources led to the site being variously located near [[Kiev]], [[Minsk]], [[Chernobyl]], [[Gomel]] or [[Chernihiv]]. All of these reports were describing the same deployment, with the transmitter only a few kilometers southwest of Chernobyl (south of Minsk, northwest of Kyiv) and the receiver about 50&nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of Chernihiv, south of Gomel). At one time there was speculation that several transmitters were in use.<ref name=mystery/>\n\nThe radar system was given the code 5\u041d32-West by the Soviets, and was set up in two closed towns, Liubech-1 held the two transmitters and Chernobyl-2 the receivers.<ref name=week>{{cite journal |url=http://www.newsweek.com/hunt-russian-woodpecker-246670 |title= The Massive Russian Radar Site in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone |first=Alexander |last=Nazaryan |date=18 April 2014 |journal=Newsweek}}</ref> Unknown to civilian observers at the time, NATO was aware of the new installation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A second installation was built near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]], in Bolshya Kartel and Lian, but did not become active for some time.\n\n===NATO Reporting Name===\nThe NATO Reporting Name for the Duga-1 is often quoted as STEEL YARD.  Many online and several print references use this name.  However some sources also use the term STEEL WORK (or STEEL WORKS).  As any \"official\" sources using NATO Reporting Names are likely to be classified, establishing the true name will be difficult.  The earliest found open source mention of a NATO Reporting Name for this system, a reference publication in print while the system was still active, unambiguously uses the term STEEL WORK.<ref name=\"The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition\">{{Cite book\n | last = \n | first = \n | authorlink =\n | editor = \n | title = The International Countermeasures Handbook, 14th Edition\n | year = 1989\n | publisher = Cardiff Publishing\n | location = Englewood, Colorado, USA\n }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Civilian identification===\nEven from the earliest reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an [[over-the-horizon radar]],<ref name=mystery>{{Cite journal\n | title = Mystery Soviet over-the-horizon tests\n | journal= Wireless World\n | pages = 53\n | date = February 1977\n | url = http://www.mysterysignals.signalshed.com/Wpecker2.html\n | accessdate = 2019-04-08\n}}</ref> and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the [[Cold War]]. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to [[Communication with submarines|submarine communications]]. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that [[Radio Moscow]] and other pro-Soviet stations were just as badly affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.\n\nAs more information about the signal became available, its purpose as a radar signal became increasingly obvious. In particular, its signal contained a clearly recognizable structure in each pulse, which was eventually identified as a 31-bit pseudo-random binary sequence, with a bit-width of 100 \u03bcs resulting in a 3.1 ms pulse.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title = Letter from J. P. Martinez\n | author =  J.P.

When a second Woodpecker appeared, this one located in eastern Russia but also pointed toward the US and covering blank spots in the first system's pattern, this conclusion became inescapable.\n\nIn 1988, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) conducted a study on the Woodpecker signal. Data analysis showed an [[pulse repetition frequency|inter-pulse period]] of about 90&nbsp;ms, a frequency range of 7 to 19&nbsp;MHz, a bandwidth of 0.02 to 0.8&nbsp;MHz, and typical transmission time of 7 minutes.\n* The signal was observed using three repetition rates: 10&nbsp;Hz, 16&nbsp;Hz and 20&nbsp;Hz.\n* The most common rate was 10&nbsp;Hz, while the 16&nbsp;Hz and 20&nbsp;Hz modes were rather rare.\n* The pulses transmitted by the woodpecker had a wide bandwidth, typically 40&nbsp;kHz.\n\n===Jamming the Woodpecker===\n[[File:Duga radar station within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine (09).JPG|thumb|upright|Steel structure of Duga-1 from the bottom]]\n\nTo combat this interference, amateur radio operators attempted to [[radio jamming|jam]] the signal by transmitting synchronized unmodulated continuous wave signals at the same pulse rate as the offending signal. They formed a club called The Russian Woodpecker Hunting Club.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Radio hams do battle with 'Russian Woodpecker' Some hams informally attempted to jam the woodpecker by tapping a microphone with a pencil emulating the woodpecker's signal while transmitting on the ham voice subbands. | author = Dave Finley | journal= The Miami Herald | date = 7 July 1982 | url = http://www.qsl.net/n1irz/woodpeck.html | accessdate = 2007-06-15}}</ref>  Core group members would frame the \"Official Practice Target\" in their radio shacks.<ref>{{Citation | title = RUSSIAN WOODPECKER HUNTING CLUB OFFICIAL PRACTICE TARGET | author = Brian Rogers | url = http://www.mysterysignals.signalshed.com/Wpecker3.html }}</ref>\n\n===Disappearance===\nStarting in the late 1980s, even as the FCC was publishing studies, the signals became less frequent, and in 1989, they disappeared altogether. Although the reasons for the eventual shutdown of the Duga systems have not been made public, the changing strategic balance with the end of the [[Cold War]] in the late 1980s likely had a major part to play.{{according to|date=March 2020}} Another factor was the success of the [[US-KS (satellite)|US-KS]] early-warning satellites, which began entering service in the early 1980s, and by this time had grown into a complete network. The satellite system provides immediate, direct and highly secure warnings, whereas any radar-based system is subject to jamming, and the effectiveness of OTH systems is also subject to atmospheric conditions.\n\nAccording to some reports, the [[Komsomolsk-na-Amure]] installation in the [[Russian Far East]] was taken off combat alert duty in November 1989, and some of its equipment was subsequently scrapped. The original Duga-1 site lies within the 30 kilometer [[Zone of alienation|Zone of Alienation]] around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl power plant]]. It appears to have been permanently deactivated, since their continued maintenance did not figure in the negotiations between Russia and Ukraine over the active [[Dnepr radar|Dnepr]] early warning radar systems at Mukachevo and Sevastopol. The antenna still stands and has been used by radio amateurs visiting the area using their own portable radio equipment.\n\n== Locations ==\n{{Location map many | Russia Khabarovsk Krai\n| AlternativeMap = Russia Khabarovsk Krai location map.svg\n| width = 180\n| float = right\n| caption = Location of Duga-2 in Khabarovsk Krai\n| label = Transmitter| label_size = 90\n| pos = right\n| lat_deg= 50 | lat_min=23 | lat_sec=07.98 | lat_dir=N\n| lon_deg= 137 | lon_min=19 | lon_sec=41.87 | lon_dir=E\n| label2 = Receiver| label2_size = 90\n| pos2 = left\n| lat2_deg= 50 | lat_min2=53 | lat_sec2=34.66 | lat_dir2=N\n| lon2_deg= 136 | lon_min2=50 | lon_sec2=12.38 | lon_dir2=E\n}}\n\nThe original Duga was the first experimental system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/russia/steel-yard.htm|title=Steel Yard OTH|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|author=John Pike|accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=ABM AND SPACE DEFENSE|author=A.

Duga is able to track launches from the Far East and from submarines in the [[Pacific Ocean]], as the missiles fly towards [[Novaya Zemlya]] in the Arctic Ocean. This huge radar complex was restored in 2002 after a fire seriously damaged it. The transmitter is located at {{coord|46|48|26|N|32|13|12|E}} and the receiver at {{Coord|47|02|28.33|N|32|11|57.29|E|}}.\n\nThe original Duga was supplanted by a pair of installations: western, Duga-1, and eastern, Duga-2. Duga-1 was built in northern Ukraine, between [[Liubech]] and [[Chernobyl]]-2.  The receiver is located at {{Coord|51|18|19.06|N|30|03|57.35|E|}} a few kilometers west-north-west of Chernobyl; the transmitter is located at {{Coord|51|38|15.98|N|30|42|10.41|E|}} about 50&nbsp;km northeast of Chernobyl (just west of [[Chernihiv]], south of [[Gomel]]). The site is open for pre-arranged visits, for which a permit must be obtained in advance; it has been open since approximately 28 October 2013. Operators who provide tours of Chernobyl and the surrounding areas are able to obtain the relevant paperwork. \n\nDuga-2, the eastern system, is located near [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] in [[Khabarovsk Krai]], with the receiver at {{Coord|50|23|07.98|N|137|19|41.87|E|}}, some 30&nbsp;km southeast of the city, and the transmitter at {{Coord|50|53|34.66|N|136|50|12.38|E|}}, around 43&nbsp;km north of the city.\n\n== Appearances in media ==\nThe Ukrainian-developed computer game ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.]]'' has a plot focused on the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] there. The game features many actual locations in the area, including the Duga-1 array. The array itself appears in ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky]]'' in the fictional city of Limansk-13. While the 'Brain Scorcher' from ''[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl]]'' was inspired by theories that Duga-1 was used for mind control, it does not take the form of the real array.\n\n[[Markiyan Kamysh]]'s novel about [[Disaster tourism|illegal trips]] to the Duga, ''A Stroll to the Zone'', was praised by reviewers as the most interesting literature debut of 2015 in [[Ukraine]]. The novel has been translated into French (with the title ''La Zone''), and was published by French publishing house [[Groupe Flammarion|Arthaud (Groupe Flammarion)]].\n\nIn ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the map \"Grid\" is placed in Pripyat near the DUGA-1 array.\n\nThe 'Russian woodpecker' appears in Justin Scott's novel ''The Shipkiller''.\n\nThe Duga at Chernobyl was the focus of the 2015 documentary film, ''[[The Russian Woodpecker]]'', by Chad Gracia. The film includes interviews with the commander of the Duga, Vladimir Musiets, as well as the Vice-Commander, the Head of the Data Center, and others involved in building and operating the radar. The documentary, which won numerous awards, also includes drone video footage of the array and handheld video footage of the surroundings as well as a climb to the top by the cinematographer, Artem Ryzhykov. The film also proposes a [[conspiracy theory]] that the [[Chernobyl disaster]] was engineered to cover up failures in the radar's design.<ref>[http://www.russianwoodpecker.com/ The Russian Woodpecker documentary (2015)]</ref>  \n\nThe Duga radar is also featured in the films of the [[Divergent trilogy|''Divergent'' series]], where it was used as the giant wall and fence surrounding the main city. In wide shots, its structure was used to create CGI images of the superstructure and several close-up scenes were shot directly at its location.\n\nA Duga radar is featured in the 2017 game ''[[Player Unknown's Battlegrounds]]'' in a map which portrays a fictional Russian Military base.\n\nThe Duga radar is heavily featured in the Virtual reality game \"Proze : Enlightenment\" a suspense/puzzle game with the theory that the radar is being used by mind controlling experiments during the 1950-60s\nThe game actually starts with the player ascending one of the pylons on a maintenance lift.<ref>http://signsine.com/proze-vr/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cobra Mist]]\n* [[Jindalee Operational Radar Network]], a similar Australian system.\n* The [[Montauk Project]] \n* [[Numbers station]]\n* [[UVB-76|The Buzzer]]\n* [[Container radar|Container (29B6) radar]], new Russian OTH Radar with similar radio interference to the Duga.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal|last=Headrick|first=James M.|title=Looking over the horizon (HF radar)|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=1 July 1990|volume=27|issue=7|pages=36\u201339|doi=10.1109/6.58421}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Headrick|first=James M.|author2=Skolnik, Merrill I.|title=Over-the-Horizon radar in the HF band|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=1 January 1974|volume=62|issue=6|pages=664\u2013673|doi=10.1109/PROC.1974.9506|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/391ad6e3748a070f41aa42a37735d0a594c71eb3}}\n* Headrick, James M., Ch. 24: \"HF over-the-horizon radar,\" in: Radar Handbook, 2nd ed., Merrill I.

He enrolled at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in 1918, receiving a Bachelor of Science in 1920 and Master of Science in 1921.  He taught German, mathematics, and science at the [[Potchefstroom Gymnasium]], Transvaal in 1922, and lectured in mathematics at the [[Transvaal University College]], Pretoria 1923\u20131925.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 124</ref>\n\nIn 1926 Brune moved to the US to attend the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) under the sponsorship of the [[General Electric Company]], receiving Batchelor and Master's degress in 1929.  From 1929 to 1930, Brune was involved in artificial lightning tests on the power transmission line from [[Croton Dam (Michigan)|Croton Dam, Michigan]] as a research assistant at MIT.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 124</ref>  From 1930, Brune was a [[Fellow]] in Electrical Engineering at MIT with an Austin Research Fellowship.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 125</ref>\n\nBrune returned to South Africa in 1935.<ref>Seising (2005), p. 19</ref>  He became Principal Research Officer at the National Research Laboratories, Pretoria.<ref>Wai-Kai Chen,  p. 23</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nIn 1933, Brune was working on his doctoral thesis entitled, ''Synthesis of Passive Networks'' and Cauer suggested that he provide a proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the realisability of multi-port impedances.  Cauer himself had found a necessary condition but had failed to prove it to be sufficient. The goal for researchers then was \"to remove the restrictions implicit in the Foster-Cauer realisations and find conditions on Z equivalent to realisability by a network composed of arbitrary interconnections of positive-valued R, C and L.\"<ref>Willems ''et al.'', p. 6</ref>\n\nBrune coined the term ''[[positive-real]]'' (PR) for that class of [[analytic function]]s that are realisable as an electrical network using passive components.<ref>Brune, 1931</ref> He did not only introduce the mathematical characterization of this function in one complex variable but also demonstrated \"the necessity and sufficiency for the realization of driving point functions of lumped, linear, finite, passive, time-invariant and bilateral network.<ref>Galkowski & Wood, pp. 5\u20136</ref> Brune also showed that if the case is limited to scalar PR functions then there was no other theoretical reason that required ideal transformers in the realisation (transformers limit the practical usefulness of the theory), but was unable to show (as others later did) that transformers can always be avoided.

He enrolled at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] in 1918, receiving a Bachelor of Science in 1920 and Master of Science in 1921.  He taught German, mathematics, and science at the [[Potchefstroom Gymnasium]], Transvaal in 1922, and lectured in mathematics at the [[Transvaal University College]], Pretoria 1923\u20131925.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 124</ref>\n\nIn 1926 Brune moved to the US to attend the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) under the sponsorship of the [[General Electric Company]], receiving Batchelor and Master's degress in 1929.  From 1929 to 1930, Brune was involved in artificial lightning tests on the power transmission line from [[Croton Dam (Michigan)|Croton Dam, Michigan]] as a research assistant at MIT.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 124</ref>  From 1930, Brune was a [[Fellow]] in Electrical Engineering at MIT with an Austin Research Fellowship.<ref>Brune (1931a), p. 125</ref>\n\nBrune returned to South Africa in 1935.<ref>Seising (2005), p. 19</ref>  He became Principal Research Officer at the National Research Laboratories, Pretoria.<ref>Wai-Kai Chen,  p. 23</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nIn 1933, Brune was working on his doctoral thesis entitled, ''Synthesis of Passive Networks'' and Cauer suggested that he provide a proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the realisability of multi-port impedances.  Cauer himself had found a necessary condition but had failed to prove it to be sufficient. The goal for researchers then was \"to remove the restrictions implicit in the Foster-Cauer realisations and find conditions on Z equivalent to realisability by a network composed of arbitrary interconnections of positive-valued R, C and L.\"<ref>Willems ''et al.'', p. 6</ref>\n\nBrune coined the term ''[[positive-real]]'' (PR) for that class of [[analytic function]]s that are realisable as an electrical network using passive components.<ref>Brune, 1931</ref> He did not only introduce the mathematical characterization of this function in one complex variable but also demonstrated \"the necessity and sufficiency for the realization of driving point functions of lumped, linear, finite, passive, time-invariant and bilateral network.<ref>Galkowski & Wood, pp. 5\u20136</ref> Brune also showed that if the case is limited to scalar PR functions then there was no other theoretical reason that required ideal transformers in the realisation (transformers limit the practical usefulness of the theory), but was unable to show (as others later did) that transformers can always be avoided. The eponymous [[Brune cycle]] continued fractions were invented by Brune to facilitate this proof.<ref>Cauer et al., pp&nbsp;7&ndash;8</ref>\n\nThe Brune theorem is:<blockquote>\n# The impedance ''Z''(''s'') of any electric network composed of passive components is positive-real.\n# If ''Z''(''s'') is positive-real it is realisable by a network having as components passive (positive) R, C, L, and ideal transformers T.<ref>Willems ''et al.'', p. 6</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrune is also responsible for the [[Brune test]] for determining the permissibility of interconnecting [[two-port network]]s.<ref>Horrocks & Nightingale, p. 249</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nFor his work, Brune is recognized as one of those who laid the foundation of network analysis by means of mathematics.

No written evidence remains of the earliest Hungarian literature, but through [[folklore|folktale]]s and [[folk song]]s, elements have survived that can be traced back to pagan times. Also extant, although only in [[Latin]] and dating from between the 11th and 14th centuries, are shortened versions of some Hungarian legends relating the origins of the Hungarian people and episodes from the conquest of Hungary and from campaigns of the 10th century.<ref name='Britannica'/>\n\nIn earliest times the Hungarian language was written in a [[Old Hungarian script|runic-like script]], although it was not used for literary purposes in the modern sense. The country switched to the [[Latin alphabet]] after being Christianized under the reign of [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] (1000\u20131038). There are no existing documents from the pre-11th century era. The Old Hungarian period is reckoned from 896 CE, when Hungarians conquered the [[Hungarian Conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Carpathian Basin]], settled down and started to build their own state. Creation of the first extant written records followed soon after. The oldest written record in Hungarian is a fragment in the [[Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] (1055) which contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words ''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea,'' (\"up the military road to [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]],\" referring to the place where the abbey was built). This text is probably to be read as ''Feh\u00e9r\u00fc v\u00e1ru re\u00e1 mene\u00fc hodu utu re\u00e1'' with today's spelling, and it would read as ''a Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rra men\u0151 had[i] \u00fatra'' in today's Hungarian. The rest of the document was written in Latin.\n\nThe oldest complete, continuous text in Hungarian is [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer|''Halotti besz\u00e9d \u00e9s k\u00f6ny\u00f6rg\u00e9s'']], a short funeral oration written in about 1192\u20131195, moving in its simplicity.<ref name='Britannica'/> The oldest poem is ''\u00d3magyar M\u00e1ria-siralom'' (the [[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Lamentations of Mary]]), a free translation from Latin of a poem by [[Godefroy de Breteuil]].<ref name='Britannica'/> It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem. Both the funeral sermon and the Lamentations are hard to read and not quite comprehensible for modern-day Hungarians, mostly because the 26-letter Latin alphabet was not sufficient to represent all the sounds in Hungarian before [[Diacritic|diacritic marks]] and double letters were added.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance, the language of writing was mostly Latin. Important documents include the ''[[Admonitions of St. Stephen]],'' which includes the king's admonitions to his son [[Emeric of Hungary (saint)|Prince Imre]].\n\nAmong the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Hungarians\"), by an unknown author, and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians\") by Simon K\u00e9zai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n\nFurther, [[Rogerius of Apulia|Rogerius]]'s 13th century work was published with [[Johannes de Thurocz|J\u00e1nos Thur\u00f3czy]]'s chronicle in the late 15th century. In [[Split, Croatia|Split]] (now a part of [[Croatia]]) [[Thomas of Spalato]] wrote on local history, with much information on Hungary in the 13th century. At that time [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Split were part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\n==Renaissance and Baroque 15-17th century==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe 15th century saw the first translations from the [[Bible]]. Two [[Voivode of Transylvania|Transylvania]]n preachers, Thomas and Valentine, followers of the [[Bohemia]]n religious reformer [[Jan Hus]], were responsible for this work, of which the prophetic books, the Psalms, and the Gospels have survived. A great part of the vocabulary created for the purpose is still in use.<ref name='Britannica'/>\n\nRenaissance literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias's reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in [[Buda]]. The first book printed in Hungary was the ''Chronica Hungarorum''.\n\nIn 1526 most of Hungary fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, from which date the beginning of the Middle Hungarian period is set, in connection with various cultural changes. The most important poets of the period were [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594), [[Sebesty\u00e9n Tin\u00f3di Lantos]] (c. 1510\u20131556) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664). Balassi's poetry shows Mediaeval influences. His poems can be divided into three thematic categories: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, ''Szigeti veszedelem'' (\"[[The Siege of Sziget|Peril of Sziget]]\", 1648/49) is an epic written in the style of the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\n[[File:Heltai chronica.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The cover of a Hungarian book from the time: [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Heltai]]'s \"Chronicle about the affairs of the [[Magyars]]\"]]\n\nTranslation of Roman authors produced also some works: [[J\u00e1nos Baranyai Decsi]] translated [[Sallustius]]'s Catalina and [[Jughurta]]'s war in the late 16th century. A decade later appeared the translation of [[Curtius Rufus]]'s life of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in [[Debrecen]].\n\nHistorical works were even more numerous: the chronicle of [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r Heltai]], published by him in [[Kolozsv\u00e1r]]; [[Zay Ferenc]]'s unpublished work on the siege of [[Belgrade]] from the 15th century; [[John Kem\u00e9ny (Prince)|Kem\u00e9ny J\u00e1nos]]'s Transylvanian Dukes, and [[Mikl\u00f3s Bethlen]]'s memoirs with [[J\u00e1nos Szal\u00e1rdy]]'s voluminous then-unpublished work on Transylvanian history from Bethlen's reign to the 1660s; and [[Mih\u00e1ly Cserei]]'s early 18th-century work are highlights of Hungarian-language literature. Another category is historical verses in Hungarian, like that of [[Sebesty\u00e9n Tin\u00f3di Lantos]] from the 16th century, [[P\u00e9ter Ilosvai Selymes]], [[Mih\u00e1ly Szabatkai]] and [[Gergely Bornemissza]].\n\nLatin works in the period are more numerous. [[Istv\u00e1n Szamosk\u00f6zy]], [[J\u00e1nos Baranyai Decsi]], [[Mikl\u00f3s Istv\u00e1nffy]], [[J\u00e1nos Bethlen]], and [[Farkas Bethlen (1639\u20131679)|Farkas Bethlen]], [[Ferenc Forg\u00e1ch, Bishop of V\u00e1rad|Ferenc Forg\u00e1ch]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Szer\u00e9mi]], [[Ambrus Somogyi]], [[Gianmichele Bruto]] and [[Ol\u00e1h Mikl\u00f3s]] are the most important authors of historical works from the 16th to 17th century. In German [[Georg Kraus]] and [[Georg Zeiler]] wrote on Transylvanian history. In Spanish one may read [[Bernardo de Aldana]]'s apology for the 1552 loss of the castle of [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]] to the Turks.\n\nAmong [[Bible translations#Hungarian Translation|religious literary works]] the most important is the [[Bible]] translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]], the [[Protestant]] pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published. Another important religious work is the ''[[Legend of Saint Margaret]]'', copied by [[Lea R\u00e1skai]] around 1510 from an earlier work that did not survive.\n\n==Enlightenment and the language reform==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\nThe Hungarian enlightenment arrived, via [[Vienna]], about fifty years after the Western European enlightenment. The first Enlightenment writers were [[Maria Theresia]]'s bodyguards ([[Gy\u00f6rgy Bessenyei]], [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi]] and so on). The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\n\nThe most prominent figure of Hungarian language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]], who helped make the [[Hungarian language]] feasible for scientific explanations; furthermore, a lot of new words were coined for describing new inventions (for example, ''mozdony'', which means 'locomotive.' Previously the [[loanword|loan word]] ''lokomot\u00edv'' had been used.)\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\" perrow=\"6\" style=\"border: 5px solid #a86; box-shadow: 0.1em 0.1em 0.5em rgba(0,0,0,0.75);

No written evidence remains of the earliest Hungarian literature, but through [[folklore|folktale]]s and [[folk song]]s, elements have survived that can be traced back to pagan times.

It is located in the area known as the [[Latin Quarter]], standing atop the [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], at the center of the [[Place du Panth\u00e9on]] which was named after it. The edifice was built from 1758 to 1790 over the designs of [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] at the behest of King [[Louis XV of France]], who meant it as a church dedicated to Saint [[Genevieve]], the city's patron saint, whose relics were to be housed there. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV however lived to see the church completed.\n\nBy the time the construction was finished, the [[French Revolution]] had started, and the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a [[mausoleum]] for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] which had been used in this way since the 16th century. The first ''panth\u00e9onis\u00e9'' was [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]], although his remains were removed from the place a few years later. The building was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century\u2014although Soufflot's remains were transferred inside it in 1829\u2014until the [[French Third Republic]] finally decreed its exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881; the placement of [[Victor Hugo]]'s remains in the crypt in 1885 was the first one in over fifty years.\n\nThe successive changes in the building's purpose resulted in modifications of the [[pediment]]'s decoration, the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag, and some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere,<ref>{{cite book|title=Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City|first=Jonathan|last=Conlin|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hG7yb-Z9dzUC&pg=PT165}}</ref> which compromised somewhat Soufflot's initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral with classical principles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nineteenth Century Art: A Critical History|first1=Stephen|last1=Eisenman|first2=Thomas E.|last2=Crow|year=2007|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYQ0AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The architecture of the Panth\u00e9on is an early example of [[Neoclassicism]], surmounted by a [[dome]] that owes some of its character to [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|''Tempietto'']].\n\nAs of 2018 the remains of 78 people have been transferred to the Panth\u00e9on, including those of 73 men and 5 women. More than half of all the ''panth\u00e9onisations'' were made under [[Napoleon]]'s rule during the [[First French Empire]]. In 1851, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] conducted a demonstration of [[diurnal motion]] at the Panth\u00e9on by suspending a pendulum from the ceiling, a copy of which is still visible today.\n\n==History==\n===Site and earlier buildings===\nThe site of the Panth\u00e9on had great significance in Paris history, and was occupied by a series of monuments. It was on Mount Lucotitius, a height on the Left Bank where the forum of the Roman town of [[Lutetia]] was located. It was also the original burial site of [[Saint Genevieve]], who had led the resistance to the [[Huns]] when they threatened Paris in 451. In 508, [[Clovis I|Clovis]], King of the Franks, constructed a church there, where he and his wife were later buried in 511 and 545. The church, originally dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was rededicated to Saint Genevieve, who became the patron saint of Paris. It was at the centre of the [[Abbey of Saint Genevieve]], a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages. Her relics were kept in the church, and were brought out for solemn processions when dangers threatened the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Premier projet du Panth\u00e9on Soufflot (1756).png|Soufflot's original plan for the Church of Saint Genevieve (1756)\nFile:Panth\u00e9on Soufflot - \u00e9levation principale.png|Soufflot's final plan: the principal facade (1777)\nFile:Coupe-Panth\u00e9on-Coupoles-Paris-France-1881.jpg|Soufflot's plan of the three domes, one within another\nFile:Dome, Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France.jpg|Looking upward at the first and second domes\nFile:Coupe-Panth\u00e9on-Armatures-Paris-France-1881.jpg|Iron rods were used to give greater strength and stability to the stone structure (1758\u201390)\n</gallery>\n[[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] vowed in 1744 that if he recovered from his illness he would replace the dilapidated church of the [[Abbey of St Genevieve]] with a grander building worthy of the patron saint of Paris. He did recover, but ten years passed before the reconstruction and enlargement of the church was begun. In 1755 The Director of the King's public works, [[Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson, marquis de Marigny]], chose [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] to design the church. Soufflot (1713\u20131780) had studied classical architecture in Rome over 1731\u201338. Most of his early work was done in Lyon. Saint Genevieve became his life's work; it was not finished until after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=T71rv5GwI0QC&pg=PA142&dq=King+Louis+XV+1744+St+Genevieve&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Patroness of Paris: Rituals of Devotion in Early Modern France |publisher=Brills Publishers |date=1998}}</ref>\n\nHis first design was completed in 1755, and was clearly influenced by the work of [[Bramante]] he had studied in Italy. It took form of a [[Greek cross]], with four naves of equal length, and monumental dome over the crossing in the centre, and a classical portico with [[Corinthian columns]] and a [[peristyle]] with a triangular pediment on the main facade.<ref>{{harvnb|Oudin|1994|p=479}}</ref> The design was modified five times over the following years, with the addition of a [[narthex]], a choir, and two towers. The design was not finalised until 1777.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe foundations were laid in 1758, but due to economic problems work proceeded slowly. In 1780, Soufflot died and was replaced by his student [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet]]. The re-modelled Abbey of St. Genevieve was finally completed in 1790, shortly after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nThe building is 110 metres long by 84 metres wide, and 83 metres high, with the crypt beneath of the same size. The ceiling was supported by isolated columns, which supported an array of [[barrel vaults]] and transverse arches. The massive dome was supported by [[pendentives]] rested upon four massive pillars. Critics of the plan contended that the pillars could not support such a large dome. Soufflot strengthened the stone structure with a system of iron rods, a predecessor of modern reinforced buildings. The bars had deteriorated by the 21st century, and a major restoration project to replace them is being carried out between 2010 and 2020.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nThe dome is actually three domes, fitting within each other. The first, lowest dome, has a coffered ceiling with rosettes, and is open in the centre. Looking through this dome, the second dome is visible, decorated with the fresco ''The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve'' by [[Antoine Gros]]. The outermost dome, visible from the outside, is built of stone bound together with iron cramps and covered with lead sheathing, rather than of carpentry construction, as was the common French practice of the period. Concealed [[buttresses]] inside the walls give additional support to the dome.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===The Revolution \u2013 The \"Temple of the Nation\"===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nParis - Panth\u00e9on JJ Rousseau.jpg|Tomb of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\nPanth\u00e9on 1795.jpg|The Panth\u00e9on in 1795.

In 1790, the Marquis de Vilette proposed that it be made a temple devoted to liberty, on the model of the Pantheon in Rome. \"Let us install statues of our great men and lay their ashes to rest in its underground recesses.\"<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 16\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=16}}</ref> The idea was formally adopted in April, 1791, after the death of the prominent revolutionary figure, [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|The Comte de Mirabeau]], the President of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] on April 2, 1791. On April 4, 1791, the Assembly decreed \"that this religious church become a temple of the nation, that the tomb of a great man become the altar of liberty.\" The also approved a new text over the entrance: \"A grateful nation honors its great men.\" On the same day the declaration was approved, the funeral of Mirabeau was held in the church.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 16\"/>\n\nThe ashes of [[Voltaire]] were placed in the Panth\u00e9on in a lavish ceremony on 21 July 1791, followed by the remains of several martyred revolutionaries, including [[Jean-Paul Marat]], and of the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In the rapid shifts of power of the Revolutionary period, two of the first men honored in Pantheon, Mirabeau and Marat, were declared enemies of the Revolution, and their remains were removed. Finally, the new government of the [[French Convention]] decreed in February, 1795 that no one should be placed in the Pantheon who had not been dead at least ten years.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 17\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the church was transformed into a mausoleum, the Assembly approved architectural changes to make the interior darker and more solemn. The architect [[Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy]] bricked up the lower windows and frosted the glass of the upper windows to reduce the light, and removed most of the ornament from the exterior. The architectural lanterns and bells were removed the facade. All of the religious friezes and statues were destroyed in 1791; it was replaced by statuary and murals on patriotic themes.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 17\"/>\n\n===Temple to church and back to temple (1806\u20131830)===\n[[File:Gros Panth\u00e9on de Paris2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Design for the cupola by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1812).

The Panth\u00e9on was under the jurisdiction of the canons of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. Celebrations of important events, such as the victory of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], were held there. However, the crypt of the church kept its official function as the resting place for illustrious Frenchmen. A new entrance directly to the crypt was created via the eastern porch (1809\u201311). The artist [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] was commissioned to decorate the interior of the cupola. It combined the secular and religious aspects of the church; it showed the Genevieve being conducted to heaven by angels, in the presence of great leaders of France, from [[Clovis I]] and [[Charlemagne]] to Napoleon and the [[Empress Josephine]].\n\nDuring the reign of Napoleon, the remains of forty-one illustrious Frenchmen were placed in the crypt. They were mostly military officers, senators and other high officials of the Empire, but also included the explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] and the painter [[Joseph-Marie Vien]], the teacher of Napoleon's official painter, [[Jacques-Louis David]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La Mort.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting on the Pendentive, depicting ''Death'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1821\u201337)]]\nDuring the [[Bourbon Restoration]] which followed the fall of Napoleon, in 1816 [[Louis XVIII of France]] restored the entire Panth\u00e9on, including the crypt, to the Catholic Church. The church was also at last officially consecrated in the presence of the King, a ceremony which had been omitted during the Revolution. The sculpture on the pediment by [[Jean Guillaume Moitte]], called ''The Fatherland crowning the heroic and civic virtues'' was replaced by a religious-themed work by [[David d'Angers]]. The reliquary of Saint Genevieve had been destroyed during the Revolution, but a few relics were found and restored to the church (They are now in the neighboring Church of [[Saint-Etienne-du-Mont]]). In 1822 [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] was commissioned to decorate the pendentives of the dome with new works representing Justice, Death, the Nation, and Fame. [[Jean-Antoine Gros]] was commissioned to redo his fresco on the inner dome, replacing Napoleon with [[Louis XVIII]], as well as figures of Louis XVI and [[Marie Antoinette]]. The new version of the cupola was inaugurated in 1824 by [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. As to the crypt where the tombs were located, it was locked and closed to visitors.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Under Louis Philippe I, the Second Republic and Napoleon III (1830\u20131871)===\n[[File:Alphonse-Louis Poitevin, The Pantheon, 1842.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Daguerreotype by [[Alphonse Louis Poitevin]], 1842]]\nThe [[French Revolution of 1830]] placed [[Louis Philippe I]] on the throne. He expressed sympathy for Revolutionary values, and on 26 August 1830, the church once again became the Pantheon. However, the crypt remained closed to the public, and no new remains were added. The only change made was to the main pediment, which had been remade with a radiant cross; it was remade again by D'Angers with a patriotic work called ''The Nation Distributing Crowns Handed to Her by Liberty, to Great Men, Civil and Military, While History Inscribes Their Names.''\n\nLouis Philippe was overthrown in 1848 and replaced by the elected government of the [[Second French Republic]], which valued revolutionary themes. The new government designated the Pantheon \"The Temple of Humanity\", and proposed to decorate it with sixty new murals honouring human progress in all fields. In 1851 the [[Foucault Pendulum]] of astronomer [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] was hung beneath the dome to illustrate the rotation of the earth. However, on complaints from the Church, it was removed in December of the same year.\n\n[[Napoleon III|Louis Napol\u00e9on]], nephew of the Emperor, was elected President of France in December 1848, and in 1852 staged a coup-d'\u00e9tat and made himself Emperor. Once again the Pantheon was returned the church, with the title of \"National Basilica\". The remaining relics of Saint Genevieve were restored to the church, and two groups of sculpture commemorating events in the life of the Saint were added. The crypt remained closed.\n\n===The Third Republic (1871\u20131939)===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nPuvis de Chavannes - Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve bringing supplies to Paris a.jpg|''Saint Genevieve bricking supplies to Paris'' by [[Puvis de Chavannes]] (1874)\nPanth\u00e9on mosa\u00efque abside.JPG|''Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People'', mosaic by Antoine-Auguste-Ernest H\u00e9bert\nPanth\u00e9on autel Convention nationale 1.JPG|''The National Convention'' by Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Siccard (1921)\nVers la Gloire tryptique.jpg|''Victory leading the Armies of the Republic'' by [[Edouard Detaille]] (1905)\n</gallery>\nThe Basilica suffered damage from German shelling during the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]].

During the early years of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], under conservative governments, it functioned as a church, but the interior walls were largely bare. Beginning in 1874, The interior was redecorated with new murals and sculptural groups linking French history and the history of the church, by notable artists including [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]], and the artist Antoine-Auguste-Ernest H\u00e9bert, who made a mosaic under the vault of the apsidal chapel called ''Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People''.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, pp. 33\u201335\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fun\u00e9railles nationales de Victor Hugo - Translation du corps au Panth\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|upright|Funeral of Victor Hugo on 1 June 1885]]\nIn 1881, a decree was passed to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum again. [[Victor Hugo]] was the first to be placed in the crypt afterwards. The subsequent governments approved the entry of literary figures, including the writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]] (1908), and, after [[World War I]], leaders of the French socialist movement, including [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]] (1920) and [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] (1924). The Third Republic governments also decreed that the building should be decorated with sculpture representing \"the golden ages and great men of France.\" The principal works remaining from this period include the sculptural group called ''The National Assembly'', commemorating the French Revolution; a statue of [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], the first man interred in the Pantheon, by Jean-Antoine Ingabert; (1889\u20131920); and two patriotic murals in the apse ''Victory Leading the Armies of the Republic'' to ''Towards Glory'' by [[\u00c9douard Detaille]], and ''Glory Entering the Temple, Followed by Poets, Philosophers, Scientists and Warriors'' , by Marie-D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Hector d'Espouy (1906).<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, pp. 33\u201335\"/>\n\n===1945\u2013present===\n[[File:Night Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Panth\u00e9on at night]]\nThe short-lived [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1948\u20131958) following [[World War II]] pantheonized two physicists, [[Paul Langevin]] and [[Jean Perrin]]; a leader of the abolitionist movement, [[Victor Sch\u0153lcher]]; early leader of [[Free France]] and colonial administrator [[F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9]]; and [[Louis Braille]], inventor of the [[Braille]] writing system, in 1952.\n\nUnder the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], the first person to be buried in the Panth\u00e9on was the Resistance leader [[Jean Moulin]].

It was designed to rival those of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome and [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London. Unlike the dome of [[Les Invalides]] in Paris, which has a wooden framework, the dome is constructed entirely of stone. It is actually three domes, one within the other, with the painted ceiling, visible from below, on the second dome. The dome is 83.0 metres (272&nbsp;ft) high, compared with the tallest dome in the world, St. Peter's Basilica at 136.57 metres (448.1&nbsp;ft).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nPierre-Antoine de Machy - Le Panth\u00e9on.jpg|The Panth\u00e9on represented with a statue of Fame at its top\nDome Panth\u00e9on Paris 23 detail.jpg|The present-day cross atop the [[roof lantern]]\n</gallery>\nThe dome is capped by a cross. However, a statue of Saint Genevieve was initially supposed to sit at the top of the dome. A cross was put temporarily in 1790. After the transformation into a mausoleum in 1791, it was planned that the cross would be replaced by a statue representing Fame. The project was however abandoned. Between 1830 and 1851, a flag was put instead. The cross returned after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte restored the building to church use. The cross was replaced with a red flag during the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871.

The second group is centred around [[Charlemagne]], who created the first universities. The third group is centred around [[Louis IX of France]], or Saint Louis, with the [[Crown of Thorns]] which he brought back from the Holy Land to place in the church of [[Sainte-Chapelle]]. The last group is centred around [[Louis XVIII]], the last King of the Restoration, and his niece, looking up into the clouds at the martyred [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].

It is located in the area known as the [[Latin Quarter]], standing atop the [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve]], at the center of the [[Place du Panth\u00e9on]] which was named after it. The edifice was built from 1758 to 1790 over the designs of [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] at the behest of King [[Louis XV of France]], who meant it as a church dedicated to Saint [[Genevieve]], the city's patron saint, whose relics were to be housed there. Neither Soufflot nor Louis XV however lived to see the church completed.\n\nBy the time the construction was finished, the [[French Revolution]] had started, and the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] voted in 1791 to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a [[mausoleum]] for the remains of distinguished French citizens, modelled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] which had been used in this way since the 16th century. The first ''panth\u00e9onis\u00e9'' was [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]], although his remains were removed from the place a few years later. The building was twice restored to church usage in the course of the 19th century\u2014although Soufflot's remains were transferred inside it in 1829\u2014until the [[French Third Republic]] finally decreed its exclusive use as a mausoleum in 1881; the placement of [[Victor Hugo]]'s remains in the crypt in 1885 was the first one in over fifty years.\n\nThe successive changes in the building's purpose resulted in modifications of the [[pediment]]'s decoration, the capping of the dome by a cross or a flag, and some of the originally existing windows were blocked up with masonry in order to give the interior a darker and more funereal atmosphere,<ref>{{cite book|title=Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City|first=Jonathan|last=Conlin|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hG7yb-Z9dzUC&pg=PT165}}</ref> which compromised somewhat Soufflot's initial attempt at combining the lightness and brightness of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral with classical principles.<ref>{{cite book|title=Nineteenth Century Art: A Critical History|first1=Stephen|last1=Eisenman|first2=Thomas E.|last2=Crow|year=2007|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yYQ0AQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The architecture of the Panth\u00e9on is an early example of [[Neoclassicism]], surmounted by a [[dome]] that owes some of its character to [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|''Tempietto'']].\n\nAs of 2018 the remains of 78 people have been transferred to the Panth\u00e9on, including five women's. More than half of all the ''panth\u00e9onisations'' were made under [[Napoleon]]'s rule during the [[First French Empire]]. In 1851, [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] conducted a demonstration of [[diurnal motion]] at the Panth\u00e9on by suspending a pendulum from the ceiling, a copy of which is still visible today.\n\n==History==\n===Site and earlier buildings===\nThe site of the Panth\u00e9on had great significance in Paris history, and was occupied by a series of monuments. It was on Mount Lucotitius, a height on the Left Bank where the forum of the Roman town of [[Lutetia]] was located. It was also the original burial site of [[Saint Genevieve]], who had led the resistance to the [[Huns]] when they threatened Paris in 451. In 508, [[Clovis I|Clovis]], King of the Franks, constructed a church there, where he and his wife were later buried in 511 and 545. The church, originally dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, was rededicated to Saint Genevieve, who became the patron saint of Paris. It was at the centre of the [[Abbey of Saint Genevieve]], a centre of religious scholarship in the Middle Ages. Her relics were kept in the church, and were brought out for solemn processions when dangers threatened the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Premier projet du Panth\u00e9on Soufflot (1756).png|Soufflot's original plan for the Church of Saint Genevieve (1756)\nFile:Panth\u00e9on Soufflot - \u00e9levation principale.png|Soufflot's final plan: the principal facade (1777)\nFile:Coupe-Panth\u00e9on-Coupoles-Paris-France-1881.jpg|Soufflot's plan of the three domes, one within another\nFile:Dome, Panth\u00e9on, Paris, France.jpg|Looking upward at the first and second domes\nFile:Coupe-Panth\u00e9on-Armatures-Paris-France-1881.jpg|Iron rods were used to give greater strength and stability to the stone structure (1758\u201390)\n</gallery>\n[[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] vowed in 1744 that if he recovered from his illness he would replace the dilapidated church of the [[Abbey of St Genevieve]] with a grander building worthy of the patron saint of Paris. He did recover, but ten years passed before the reconstruction and enlargement of the church was begun. In 1755 The Director of the King's public works, [[Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson, marquis de Marigny]], chose [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]] to design the church. Soufflot (1713\u20131780) had studied classical architecture in Rome over 1731\u201338. Most of his early work was done in Lyon. Saint Genevieve became his life's work; it was not finished until after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=T71rv5GwI0QC&pg=PA142&dq=King+Louis+XV+1744+St+Genevieve&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Patroness of Paris: Rituals of Devotion in Early Modern France |publisher=Brills Publishers |date=1998}}</ref>\n\nHis first design was completed in 1755, and was clearly influenced by the work of [[Bramante]] he had studied in Italy. It took form of a [[Greek cross]], with four naves of equal length, and monumental dome over the crossing in the centre, and a classical portico with [[Corinthian columns]] and a [[peristyle]] with a triangular pediment on the main facade.<ref>{{harvnb|Oudin|1994|p=479}}</ref> The design was modified five times over the following years, with the addition of a [[narthex]], a choir, and two towers. The design was not finalised until 1777.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe foundations were laid in 1758, but due to economic problems work proceeded slowly. In 1780, Soufflot died and was replaced by his student [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet]]. The re-modelled Abbey of St. Genevieve was finally completed in 1790, shortly after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nThe building is 110 metres long by 84 metres wide, and 83 metres high, with the crypt beneath of the same size. The ceiling was supported by isolated columns, which supported an array of [[barrel vaults]] and transverse arches. The massive dome was supported by [[pendentives]] rested upon four massive pillars. Critics of the plan contended that the pillars could not support such a large dome. Soufflot strengthened the stone structure with a system of iron rods, a predecessor of modern reinforced buildings. The bars had deteriorated by the 21st century, and a major restoration project to replace them is being carried out between 2010 and 2020.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nThe dome is actually three domes, fitting within each other. The first, lowest dome, has a coffered ceiling with rosettes, and is open in the centre. Looking through this dome, the second dome is visible, decorated with the fresco ''The Apotheosis of Saint Genevieve'' by [[Antoine Gros]]. The outermost dome, visible from the outside, is built of stone bound together with iron cramps and covered with lead sheathing, rather than of carpentry construction, as was the common French practice of the period.

In 1790, the Marquis de Vilette proposed that it be made a temple devoted to liberty, on the model of the Pantheon in Rome. \"Let us install statues of our great men and lay their ashes to rest in its underground recesses.\"<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 16\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=16}}</ref> The idea was formally adopted in April, 1791, after the death of the prominent revolutionary figure, [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|The Comte de Mirabeau]], the President of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] on April 2, 1791. On April 4, 1791, the Assembly decreed \"that this religious church become a temple of the nation, that the tomb of a great man become the altar of liberty.\" The also approved a new text over the entrance: \"A grateful nation honors its great men.\" On the same day the declaration was approved, the funeral of Mirabeau was held in the church.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 16\"/>\n\nThe ashes of [[Voltaire]] were placed in the Panth\u00e9on in a lavish ceremony on 21 July 1791, followed by the remains of several martyred revolutionaries, including [[Jean-Paul Marat]], and of the philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. In the rapid shifts of power of the Revolutionary period, two of the first men honored in Pantheon, Mirabeau and Marat, were declared enemies of the Revolution, and their remains were removed. Finally, the new government of the [[French Convention]] decreed in February, 1795 that no one should be placed in the Pantheon who had not been dead at least ten years.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 17\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the church was transformed into a mausoleum, the Assembly approved architectural changes to make the interior darker and more solemn. The architect [[Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy]] bricked up the lower windows and frosted the glass of the upper windows to reduce the light, and removed most of the ornament from the exterior. The architectural lanterns and bells were removed the facade. All of the religious friezes and statues were destroyed in 1791; it was replaced by statuary and murals on patriotic themes.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, p. 17\"/>\n\n===Temple to church and back to temple (1806\u20131830)===\n[[File:Gros Panth\u00e9on de Paris2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Design for the cupola by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1812). Napoleon is at the bottom right. (Now in the [[Carnavalet Museum]])]]\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], when he became First Consul in 1801, signed a Concordat with the Pope, agreeing to restore former church properties, including the Panth\u00e9on. The Panth\u00e9on was under the jurisdiction of the canons of the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. Celebrations of important events, such as the victory of Napoleon at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], were held there. However, the crypt of the church kept its official function as the resting place for illustrious Frenchmen. A new entrance directly to the crypt was created via the eastern porch (1809\u201311). The artist [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] was commissioned to decorate the interior of the cupola. It combined the secular and religious aspects of the church; it showed the Genevieve being conducted to heaven by angels, in the presence of great leaders of France, from [[Clovis I]] and [[Charlemagne]] to Napoleon and the [[Empress Josephine]].\n\nDuring the reign of Napoleon, the remains of forty-one illustrious Frenchmen were placed in the crypt. They were mostly military officers, senators and other high officials of the Empire, but also included the explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] and the painter [[Joseph-Marie Vien]], the teacher of Napoleon's official painter, [[Jacques-Louis David]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n[[File:La Mort.jpg|thumb|upright|Painting on the Pendentive, depicting ''Death'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1821\u201337)]]\nDuring the [[Bourbon Restoration]] which followed the fall of Napoleon, in 1816 [[Louis XVIII of France]] restored the entire Panth\u00e9on, including the crypt, to the Catholic Church. The church was also at last officially consecrated in the presence of the King, a ceremony which had been omitted during the Revolution. The sculpture on the pediment by [[Jean Guillaume Moitte]], called ''The Fatherland crowning the heroic and civic virtues'' was replaced by a religious-themed work by [[David d'Angers]]. The reliquary of Saint Genevieve had been destroyed during the Revolution, but a few relics were found and restored to the church (They are now in the neighboring Church of [[Saint-Etienne-du-Mont]]). In 1822 [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] was commissioned to decorate the pendentives of the dome with new works representing Justice, Death, the Nation, and Fame. [[Jean-Antoine Gros]] was commissioned to redo his fresco on the inner dome, replacing Napoleon with [[Louis XVIII]], as well as figures of Louis XVI and [[Marie Antoinette]]. The new version of the cupola was inaugurated in 1824 by [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. As to the crypt where the tombs were located, it was locked and closed to visitors.<ref>{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Under Louis Philippe I, the Second Republic and Napoleon III (1830\u20131871)===\n[[File:Alphonse-Louis Poitevin, The Pantheon, 1842.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Daguerreotype by [[Alphonse Louis Poitevin]], 1842]]\nThe [[French Revolution of 1830]] placed [[Louis Philippe I]] on the throne. He expressed sympathy for Revolutionary values, and on 26 August 1830, the church once again became the Pantheon. However, the crypt remained closed to the public, and no new remains were added. The only change made was to the main pediment, which had been remade with a radiant cross; it was remade again by D'Angers with a patriotic work called ''The Nation Distributing Crowns Handed to Her by Liberty, to Great Men, Civil and Military, While History Inscribes Their Names.''\n\nLouis Philippe was overthrown in 1848 and replaced by the elected government of the [[Second French Republic]], which valued revolutionary themes. The new government designated the Pantheon \"The Temple of Humanity\", and proposed to decorate it with sixty new murals honouring human progress in all fields. In 1851 the [[Foucault Pendulum]] of astronomer [[L\u00e9on Foucault]] was hung beneath the dome to illustrate the rotation of the earth. However, on complaints from the Church, it was removed in December of the same year.\n\n[[Napoleon III|Louis Napol\u00e9on]], nephew of the Emperor, was elected President of France in December 1848, and in 1852 staged a coup-d'\u00e9tat and made himself Emperor. Once again the Pantheon was returned the church, with the title of \"National Basilica\". The remaining relics of Saint Genevieve were restored to the church, and two groups of sculpture commemorating events in the life of the Saint were added. The crypt remained closed.\n\n===The Third Republic (1871\u20131939)===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100\">\nPuvis de Chavannes - Sainte Genevi\u00e8ve bringing supplies to Paris a.jpg|''Saint Genevieve bricking supplies to Paris'' by [[Puvis de Chavannes]] (1874)\nPanth\u00e9on mosa\u00efque abside.JPG|''Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People'', mosaic by Antoine-Auguste-Ernest H\u00e9bert\nPanth\u00e9on autel Convention nationale 1.JPG|''The National Convention'' by Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Siccard (1921)\nVers la Gloire tryptique.jpg|''Victory leading the Armies of the Republic'' by [[Edouard Detaille]] (1905)\n</gallery>\nThe Basilica suffered damage from German shelling during the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]].

During the early years of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], under conservative governments, it functioned as a church, but the interior walls were largely bare. Beginning in 1874, The interior was redecorated with new murals and sculptural groups linking French history and the history of the church, by notable artists including [[Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]], and the artist Antoine-Auguste-Ernest H\u00e9bert, who made a mosaic under the vault of the apsidal chapel called ''Christ Showing the Angel of France the Destiny of Her People''.<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, pp. 33\u201335\">{{harvnb|Lebeurre|2000|pp=33\u201335}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fun\u00e9railles nationales de Victor Hugo - Translation du corps au Panth\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|upright|Funeral of Victor Hugo on 1 June 1885]]\nIn 1881, a decree was passed to transform the Church of Saint Genevieve into a mausoleum again. [[Victor Hugo]] was the first to be placed in the crypt afterwards.

The Third Republic governments also decreed that the building should be decorated with sculpture representing \"the golden ages and great men of France.\" The principal works remaining from this period include the sculptural group called ''The National Assembly'', commemorating the French Revolution; a statue of [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], the first man interred in the Pantheon, by Jean-Antoine Ingabert; (1889\u20131920); and two patriotic murals in the apse ''Victory Leading the Armies of the Republic'' to ''Towards Glory'' by [[\u00c9douard Detaille]], and ''Glory Entering the Temple, Followed by Poets, Philosophers, Scientists and Warriors'' , by Marie-D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Hector d'Espouy (1906).<ref name=\"Lebeurre 2000, pp. 33\u201335\"/>\n\n===1945\u2013present===\n[[File:Night Paris.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Panth\u00e9on at night]]\nThe short-lived [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1948\u20131958) following [[World War II]] pantheonized two physicists, [[Paul Langevin]] and [[Jean Perrin]]; a leader of the abolitionist movement, [[Victor Sch\u0153lcher]]; early leader of [[Free France]] and colonial administrator [[F\u00e9lix \u00c9bou\u00e9]]; and [[Louis Braille]], inventor of the [[Braille]] writing system, in 1952.\n\nUnder the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], the first person to be buried in the Panth\u00e9on was the Resistance leader [[Jean Moulin]].

It was designed to rival those of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome and [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London. Unlike the dome of [[Les Invalides]] in Paris, which has a wooden framework, the dome is constructed entirely of stone. It is actually three domes, one within the other, with the painted ceiling, visible from below, on the second dome. The dome is 83.0 metres (272&nbsp;ft) high, compared with the tallest dome in the world, St. Peter's Basilica at 136.57 metres (448.1&nbsp;ft).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nPierre-Antoine de Machy - Le Panth\u00e9on.jpg|The Panth\u00e9on represented with a statue of Fame at its top\nDome Panth\u00e9on Paris 23 detail.jpg|The present-day cross atop the [[roof lantern]]\n</gallery>\nThe dome is capped by a cross. However, a statue of Saint Genevieve was initially supposed to sit at the top of the dome. A cross was put temporarily in 1790. After the transformation into a mausoleum in 1791, it was planned that the cross would be replaced by a statue representing Fame. The project was however abandoned. Between 1830 and 1851, a flag was put instead. The cross returned after Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte restored the building to church use. The cross was replaced with a red flag during the [[Paris Commune]] in 1871.

The second group is centred around [[Charlemagne]], who created the first universities. The third group is centred around [[Louis IX of France]], or Saint Louis, with the [[Crown of Thorns]] which he brought back from the Holy Land to place in the church of [[Sainte-Chapelle]]. The last group is centred around [[Louis XVIII]], the last King of the Restoration, and his niece, looking up into the clouds at the martyred [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie-Antoinette]].

{"title_page": "Junior doctor", "text_new": "{{about|the medical professional designation in the UK|junior doctors in Ireland|Non-consultant hospital doctor|the television series|Junior Doctors: Your Life in Their Hands}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], '''junior doctors''' are qualified [[medical practitioner]]s working whilst engaged in postgraduate training. The period of being a junior doctor starts when they qualify as a medical practitioner following graduation with a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] degree and start the UK [[Foundation Programme]], it culminates in a post as a [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]], a [[General Practitioner]] (GP), or some other non-training post, such as a [[Staff grade]] or Associate Specialist post.\n\nThe term ''junior doctor'' currently incorporates the grades of [[Foundation doctor]] and [[Specialty registrar]]. Prior to 2007 it included the grades of [[Pre-registration house officer]], [[Senior house officer]] and [[Specialist registrar]].  During this time junior doctors will do postgraduate examinations to become members of a [[Medical royal college]] relevant to the specialty in which they are training, for example [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]] for doctors specialising in [[Internal medicine]], [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons]] for doctors specialising in [[surgery]] or [[Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners]] for doctors specialising in [[family medicine]].  Doctors typically may be junior doctors for 5\u201315 years, and this may be extended by doing research towards a higher degree, for example towards a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] or [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|Doctor of Medicine]] degree.
