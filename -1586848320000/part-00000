It features an ensemble cast including [[Bruce Willis]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], [[Bob Balaban]], Harvey Keitel, and newcomers [[Jared Gilman]] and [[Kara Hayward]]. Largely set on the fictional New England island of New Penzance, it tells the story of an orphan boy (Gilman) who escapes from a scouting camp to unite with his pen pal and love interest, a girl with aggressive tendencies (Hayward). Feeling alienated from their guardians and shunned by their peers, the lovers abscond to an isolated beach. Meanwhile, the island's police captain (Willis) organizes a search party of scouts and family members to locate the runaways.\n\nIn crafting their screenplay, Anderson and Coppola drew from personal experiences and memories of childhood fantasies as well as films including ''[[Melody (1971 film)|Melody]]'' (1971) and ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Auditions for [[child actor]]s took eight months, and filming took place in [[Rhode Island]] over three months in 2011.\n\n''Moonrise Kingdom'' premiered at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and received critical acclaim, with its themes of young love, [[child sexuality]], juvenile mental health, and the [[Genesis flood narrative]] being praised. Critics cited the film's color palette and use of visual symmetry as well as the use of original composition by [[Alexandre Desplat]] to supplement existing music by [[Benjamin Britten]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy]]. In 2016, the [[BBC]] included the film in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|its list of greatest films of the twenty-first century]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Work within the limit and DO NOT ADD -->\nOn the [[New England]] island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by [[Scout leader|Scout Master]] Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' and became [[pen pal]]s. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair meet at their rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island.\n\nMeanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned his position as a Khaki Scout. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader, Redford, with a pair of lefty scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove, which they name \"Moonrise Kingdom\". They set up camp, and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss.\n\nSuzy's parents, Scout Master Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of \"Social Services,\" an otherwise nameless woman who plans to place Sam in a \"juvenile refuge\" and explore the possibility of treating him with [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]].\n\nWhile contemplating in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. Together, they paddle to a neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. Ben performs a \"wedding\" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding before they leave. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scout Master Ward, pursue them instead.\n\nA violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, allowing him to stay on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.\n\nAt Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car and tells Suzy that he will see her the following day.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector Wes Anderson had long been interested in depicting a romance between children.<ref name=\"Clarke\">{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Cath |title=Wes Anderson interview |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=2012 |accessdate=May 11, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512112214/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |archivedate=May 12, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He described the starting idea for the story as a memory of fantasized young love:\n{{quote|I remember this feeling, from when I was that age and from when I was in fifth grade, but nothing really happened.

Wilkins wrote that the story dealt with \"existential\" questions, with the two young protagonists rejected by society and allying to escape to \"a limited existence beyond its boundaries\".{{sfn|Wilkins|2014|p=26}} According to a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' analysis, ''Moonrise Kingdom'' represented Anderson's most focused study on a theme running through his work, \"the feelings of misunderstood, unconventional children\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-cannes-bill-murray-wes-anderson-moonrise-kingdom-20120516-column.html |title=Bill Murray talks about a director he likes, Wes Anderson of 'Moonrise Kingdom' |date=May 16, 2012 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516012803/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-cannes-bill-murray-wes-anderson-moonrise-kingdom-20120516-column.html |archivedate=May 16, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nJ.M. Tyree of ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' argued the story illustrated both an affinity with and \"arch skepticism\" of the \"comedy of love\", where in [[Shakespearean comedy]] lovers, after courtship and marriage, would \"return to a reconstituted civilized order\".

Professor Emma Mason suggested their large house serves as a \"[[mausoleum]]-like shelter\".{{sfn|Mason|2016}} Sam is also disowned by his foster family for behaviors like arson while sleepwalking. While he told Suzy \"I feel like I'm in a family now\", academic Donna Kornhaber argued Sam, as an orphan, has a realistic perspective on the difficulties of building a family.{{sfn|Kornhaber|2017}} As an adoptive father Sharp may not be ready, Tyree wrote, \"but [his] lack of self-centeredness sets him apart from other would-be fathers or mentors in Anderson's world\".<ref name=\"Tyree\"/>\n\nProfessor Laura Shakelford observed how Suzy as the raven in ''Noye's Fludde'' is followed by a historic rainstorm echoing [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's flood]].{{sfn|Shakelford|2014|p=199}} Scholar Anton Karl Kozlovic suggested that while the film includes no quotes from the [[Book of Genesis]] and no shots of a copy of the Book, Noah's story is used for symbolism. The children dress as animals before floods cause them to seek shelter in the church, Kozlovic observed.{{sfn|Kozlovic|2016|p=47}} Following the Genesis narrative, after the New Penzance flood, there is \"abundant regeneration\" with great harvests of high-quality produce.{{sfn|Reinhartz|2013|p=135}} Shakelford read the story as a commentary on the characters grappling with the relationship between \"the material world\" in \"postmodern cultures\" and that of animals.{{sfn|Shakelford|2014|p=199}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Moonrise Kingdom props - Arclight Hollywood (7340408738).jpg|thumb|[[Roger Ebert]] wrote the [[color scheme]] emphasized khaki and green.]]\nAcademic James MacDowell evaluated the film's style as displaying \"the director's trademark flat, symmetrical, tableau framings of carefully arranged characters within colorful, fastidiously decorated sets\" with \"patent unnaturalism and self-consciousness\".{{sfn|Macdowell|2014|p=158}} Considering the emphasis on [[symmetry]] (as opposed to other photographic composition strategies such as the [[rule of thirds]]) and color, authors Stephanie Williams and Christen Vidanovic wrote, \"Almost every frame in this movie could be a beautiful photograph.\"{{sfn|Williams|Vidanovic|2013|p=95}} Critic Robbie Collin added that besides the symmetry, many shots are \"busy with detail, and if something visually dull has to happen, Anderson embellishes it: when Sam and Suzy retreat to have a quiet heart-to-heart, he places their silent conversation on the left hand side of the frame and an enthusiastic young trampolinist on the right\".<ref name=\"Collin\">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/9289794/Moonrise-Kingdom-review.html |title=Moonrise Kingdom, review |last=Collin |first=Robbie |date=May 25, 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514213733/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/9289794/Moonrise-Kingdom-review.html |archivedate=May 14, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] identified the [[color scheme]] as emphasizing green in the grass, [[khaki]] in the Scouts camp and uniforms, and some red, creating \"the feeling of magical realism\".<ref name=\"Ebert\"/>\n\nScholar Nicolas Llano Linares wrote that Anderson's films are \"distinctively ''andersonian'' to the limit\", \"filled with ornate elements that create particular worlds that define the tone of the story, the visual and material dimensions of his sets\". Linares particularly commented on the use of the animated maps, which make Anderson's universe more credible, and also have metaphorical significance.{{sfn|Linares|2016}} Macdowell pointed to the characters' books and the production of ''Noye's Fludde'' as examples of the \"indulgent, excessive, yet attractive neatness\" that children in Anderson's films enjoy. He also interpreted the animated maps as showing a na\u00efve style.{{sfn|Macdowell|2014|p=158}}\n\nIn the scene where the Khaki Scouts meet with Cousin Ben, writer Michael Frierson observed how the [[tracking shot]] is combined with \"clipped, military dialogue\". The tents in the background in the tracking shot are in symmetry. Frierson also judged the moving camera as \"smooth, stabilized\".{{sfn|Frierson|2018}} Joshua Gooch observed the [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolve]] between Sam's artwork and the Moonrise Kingdom beach tied together art with desire.{{sfn|Gooch|2014|p=196}}\n\nThe dialogue is similarly \"stylized\" and \"mannered\" as in other Anderson films, which O'Brien viewed as fitting for \"alienated twelve-year-olds who, on top of everything else, must invent a way to communicate with each other\".<ref name=\"Obrien\">{{cite web |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3710-moonrise-kingdom-awakenings |title=Moonrise Kingdom: Awakenings |last=O'Brien |first=Geoffrey |date=September 22, 2015 |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215121702/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3710-moonrise-kingdom-awakenings |archivedate=February 15, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This dialogue is spoken with \"self-aware deadpan\" performances.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/24/153292231/moonrise-kingdom-quirk-and-an-earnest-heart |title='Moonrise Kingdom': Quirk, And An Earnest Heart |last=Buckwalter |first=Ian |date=May 24, 2012 |publisher=[[NPR]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030130126/http://www.npr.org/2012/05/24/153292231/moonrise-kingdom-quirk-and-an-earnest-heart |archivedate=October 30, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Moonrise Kingdom\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Alexandre Desplat]], various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = May 22, 2012\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score]]<br>[[Classical music|Classical]]\n| length     = 1:04:11\n| label      = [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Wes Anderson]] film soundtrack\n| prev_title = [[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)#Soundtrack|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]\n| prev_year  = 2009\n| next_title = [[The Grand Budapest Hotel#Soundtrack|The Grand Budapest Hotel]]\n| next_year  = 2014\n}}\n{{Anchor|Music|Soundtrack}}\n[[Alexandre Desplat]] composed the original score, with percussion compositions by frequent Anderson collaborator [[Mark Mothersbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Rodrigo |title=Make Your Own Mixtape: 17 Songs From Wes Anderson's Films That Are Not On The Official Soundtracks |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/05/make-your-own-mixtape-17-songs-from-wes-andersons-films-that-are-not-on-the-official-soundtracks-110305/ |work=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=May 12, 2018 |date=May 25, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728140348/http://www.indiewire.com/2012/05/make-your-own-mixtape-17-songs-from-wes-andersons-films-that-are-not-on-the-official-soundtracks-110305/ |archivedate=July 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The film's final credits feature a deconstructed rendition of Desplat's original soundtrack in the style of English composer [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''Young Person's Guide'', accompanied by a child's voice to introduce each instrumental section.<ref>{{cite web |last=Platt |first=Russell |title=Benjamin Britten's 'Moonrise Kingdom' |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/benjamin-brittens-moonrise-kingdom |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=May 12, 2018 |date=August 6, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325105706/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/benjamin-brittens-moonrise-kingdom |archivedate=March 25, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack also features music by Britten, a composer notable for his many works for children's voices.

It features an ensemble cast including [[Bruce Willis]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Jason Schwartzman]], [[Bob Balaban]], and newcomers [[Jared Gilman]] and [[Kara Hayward]]. Largely set on the fictional New England island of New Penzance, it tells the story of an orphan boy (Gilman) who escapes from a scouting camp to unite with his pen pal and love interest, a girl with aggressive tendencies (Hayward). Feeling alienated from their guardians and shunned by their peers, the lovers abscond to an isolated beach. Meanwhile, the island's police captain (Willis) organizes a search party of scouts and family members to locate the runaways.\n\nIn crafting their screenplay, Anderson and Coppola drew from personal experiences and memories of childhood fantasies as well as films including ''[[Melody (1971 film)|Melody]]'' (1971) and ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Auditions for [[child actor]]s took eight months, and filming took place in [[Rhode Island]] over three months in 2011.\n\n''Moonrise Kingdom'' premiered at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]] and received critical acclaim, with its themes of young love, [[child sexuality]], juvenile mental health, and the [[Genesis flood narrative]] being praised. Critics cited the film's color palette and use of visual symmetry as well as the use of original composition by [[Alexandre Desplat]] to supplement existing music by [[Benjamin Britten]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy]]. In 2016, the [[BBC]] included the film in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|its list of greatest films of the twenty-first century]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Work within the limit and DO NOT ADD -->\nOn the [[New England]] island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by [[Scout leader|Scout Master]] Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summer's End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent, and mature for their age, meet in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of ''[[Noye's Fludde]]'' and became [[pen pal]]s. The relationship becomes romantic over the course of their correspondence and they make a secret pact to reunite and run away together. In September 1965, they execute their plan. Sam escapes from Camp Ivanhoe while Suzy runs away from Summer's End. The pair meet at their rendezvous, hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island.\n\nMeanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sam's absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned his position as a Khaki Scout. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam. Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and tries to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts' de facto leader, Redford, with a pair of lefty scissors, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoe's dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove, which they name \"Moonrise Kingdom\". They set up camp, and as the romantic tension between them grows, they dance on the beach and share each other's first kiss.\n\nSuzy's parents, Scout Master Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp finally find Sam and Suzy in their tent. Suzy's parents take her home. Ward gives Sam a letter from the Billingsleys stating that they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of \"Social Services,\" an otherwise nameless woman who plans to place Sam in a \"juvenile refuge\" and explore the possibility of treating him with [[electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]].\n\nWhile contemplating in their treehouse, the Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help Suzy and Sam. Together, they paddle to a neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Ward's superior Commander Pierce. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. Ben performs a \"wedding\" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding before they leave. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat, and Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scout Master Ward, pursue them instead.\n\nA violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sam's legal guardian, allowing him to stay on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.\n\nAt Summer's End, Sam is upstairs painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom. Suzy and her brothers are called to dinner, while Sam slips out of the window to join Sharp in his patrol car and tells Suzy that he will see her the following day.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDirector Wes Anderson had long been interested in depicting a romance between children.<ref name=\"Clarke\">{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Cath |title=Wes Anderson interview |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=2012 |accessdate=May 11, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180512112214/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/wes-anderson-interview-2 |archivedate=May 12, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He described the starting idea for the story as a memory of fantasized young love:\n{{quote|I remember this feeling, from when I was that age and from when I was in fifth grade, but nothing really happened.

A total of 22 women competed in this event, limited to [[j\u016bd\u014dka]] with a body weight of less than 52 kilograms.\nPreliminary rounds started at 12:00 [[China Standard Time|CST]], while [[repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00 CST.\n\nThis event was the second-lightest of the women's judo weight classes, limiting competitors to a maximum of 52 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
