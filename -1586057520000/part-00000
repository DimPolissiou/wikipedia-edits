A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co.

9 September 1978) was a British-born Australian [[market researcher]] and founder of the Ashby Research Service. A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer.

Special events held throughout the season with guest race classes, spectator races, candy giveaways, bicycle giveaways, an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] [[fireworks]] show, and more.\n\nThe schedule for 2020 is filled with exciting races each week.  Pit gates open at 4 pm and General Admission Gates open at 5pm with hot laps at 6:30 and racing at 7pm. \n\nFans, drivers, and car owners will be impressed with the track staff members who work hard to ensure that the evening is fun and entertaining, and that each fan, driver, and car owner knows how their support of local racing is appreciated. The tradition still continues each year, bringing family entertainment and exciting racing action.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 2012, track owner and promoter, Roger Archer is celebrating his 27th year as a racetrack operator. Seventeen of those years have been spent in [[Ennis, Texas]] at 85 Speedway, the oldest racing facility in [[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis County]]. Previously, the Archer's owned Texas All-Star Speedway, in [[Bellmead, Texas]], but sold the track in 1995 to relocate to [[Ennis, Texas|Ennis]].\n\nRoger was born and raised around cars his entire childhood. Later, he opened his own car repair businesses, and owned and operated the garage for 45 years. Racing and cars were in his blood.  He went to his first car race when he was 9 years old, with his dad. Roger started racing [[Sprint car racing|sprint cars]] when he was 26 years old, building and maintaining the car. Roger was his own boss, so every week, he was making his way to tracks in [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Oklahoma]]. Roger was lucky enough to have raced with [[Johnny Rutherford (driver)|Johnny Rutherford]], [[Jim McElreath]], and Eldon Dotson, among many others. Roger has also been featured in Circle Track Magazine, and is well-known and respected in the [[dirt track racing]] sport.\n\nAfter 22 years of racing, Roger finally decided to stop racing, and put all his talent into Texas All-Star Speedway in [[Bellmead, Texas]], just outside [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]. Roger and Wanda, their daughter Tila, and granddaughter Melanie operated the track for nearly 10 years before 85 Speedway became available for sale in 1995, and the Archer's made the track, which was originally opened in 1985, their new home.\n\n==Hours and Policies==\nThe season runs from February to October. Gates open at 5:00 p.m. and races begin at 7:00 p.m. Concession stand serves hot food, cold drinks, including cold beer. Alcohol is not allowed in the pits. No outside food or drinks allowed in Grand Stand area. Track phone: 317-777-2222\n\n==Location and Contact==\nThe track is located 5.2 miles East of I-45, Exit 249 in [[Ennis, Texas]]. Track phone: 317-777-2222.\n\n==Season History==\n\n===2011 Season===\nNew to the track in 2011 are the reintroduction of the Street Stock division and the addition of the Jr. Mini Stock division. Jr. Mini Stock is a class for children ages 12 to 16 with the cars being 4-cylinder, rear-wheel drive, and some race modifications.\n\n===2010 Season===\nNew to the track in 2010, racing cars is for teens and pre-teens too, and starting in March, boys and girls, ages 11\u201315, will be racing in the Twister class.  This is the first season for this class to compete at 85 Speedway, but other tracks around [[Texas]] have found it a popular activity and sport for the young drivers and their parents. These drivers compete in 4-cylinder, [[front-wheel drive]] cars that are completely stock, except for windshields and glass that have been removed. These young drivers learn driving skills, basic car maintenance, and [[sportsmanship]], while spending quality time with their families.\n\nEach of the different classes of cars, compete for points, and all competitors, including he Twister class, compete throughout the year for the Championship at the end of the season. Season-end also brings the annual two-day race, and any special shows that are planned. The end-of-season shows always bring cars and fans from all around the state and lots of exciting racing action. There is space for overnight camping during our two-day shows, and the drivers are always anxious to spend time talking to their fans during the extended weekend.\n\n==Track Champions==\n\n===2010 Champions===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The regular weekly classes are Twister, Jr. Mini, Cruiser, Bomber, Street Stock, IMCA Southern Sport Mod, and IMCA Modified.  Special classes are the SST Sprint Cars, the Winged Modifieds, the Lone Star Dwarf Car Club, the Southern Outlaw Street Stock, and the Young Guns.\n\nIn 2011, a class was started for young, beginner drivers called the Twisters.  These 4-cylinder, front-wheel drive cars are completely stock.  Drivers could start at 11 years of age, with their parents approval.  The class was very popular with kids and grownups too.  For older and more experienced drivers, the Jr. Mini class was also a 4-cylinder car but these cars are rear wheel drive cars, and faster than the Twisters. The special classes continued and included the Lone Star Dwarf Car Club and the Southern Street Stock class.  The track also hosted special sanctioned races during the year.\n \n2010's special classes include the Lone Star Dwarf Car Club and the Southern Street Stock class from Texas Dirt Motorplex in [[East Texas]]. The track is also host, each season, to the Regional IMCA Southern SportMod race which brings cars from [[Texas]] and the surrounding states.\n\nFans, drivers, and car owners will be impressed with the track staff members who work hard to ensure that the evening is fun and entertaining, and that each fan, driver, and car owner knows how their support of local racing is appreciated. The tradition still continues each year, bringing family entertainment and exciting racing action.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 2012, track owner and promoter, Roger Archer is celebrating his 27th year as a racetrack operator. Seventeen of those years have been spent in [[Ennis, Texas]] at 85 Speedway, the oldest racing facility in [[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis County]]. Previously, the Archer's owned Texas All-Star Speedway, in [[Bellmead, Texas]], but sold the track in 1995 to relocate to [[Ennis, Texas|Ennis]].\n\nRoger was born and raised around cars his entire childhood. Later, he opened his own car repair businesses, and owned and operated the garage for 45 years. Racing and cars were in his blood.  He went to his first car race when he was 9 years old, with his dad. Roger started racing [[Sprint car racing|sprint cars]] when he was 26 years old, building and maintaining the car. Roger was his own boss, so every week, he was making his way to tracks in [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Oklahoma]]. Roger was lucky enough to have raced with [[Johnny Rutherford (driver)|Johnny Rutherford]], [[Jim McElreath]], and Eldon Dotson, among many others. Roger has also been featured in Circle Track Magazine, and is well-known and respected in the [[dirt track racing]] sport.\n\nAfter 22 years of racing, Roger finally decided to stop racing, and put all his talent into Texas All-Star Speedway in [[Bellmead, Texas]], just outside [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]. Roger and Wanda, their daughter Tila, and granddaughter Melanie operated the track for nearly 10 years before 85 Speedway became available for sale in 1995, and the Archer's made the track, which was originally opened in 1985, their new home.\n\n==Hours and Policies==\nThe season runs from mid-March to September. Gates open at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and races begin at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Concession stands serve hot food, cold drinks, and lots of sweet treats. Ice chests are allowed and alcohol is permitted, but no glass bottles. Alcohol is not allowed in the pits. Track phone: 972-875-8500\n\n==Location and Contact==\nThe track is located 5.2 miles East of I-45, Exit 249 in [[Ennis, Texas]]. Track phone: 972-875-8500.\n\n==Season History==\n\n===2012 Season===\nNew to the track in 2012 are two classes for kids that will complete weekly with kids starting at 11 years of age.  Food is being cooked on the bar-b-que pit each week with great food all night.\n\n===2011 Season===\nNew to the track in 2011 are the reintroduction of the Street Stock division and the addition of the Jr. Mini Stock division. Jr. Mini Stock is a class for children ages 12 to 16 with the cars being 4-cylinder, rear-wheel drive, and some race modifications.\n\n===2010 Season===\nNew to the track in 2010, racing cars is for teens and pre-teens too, and starting in March, boys and girls, ages 11\u201315, will be racing in the Twister class.  This is the first season for this class to compete at 85 Speedway, but other tracks around [[Texas]] have found it a popular activity and sport for the young drivers and their parents. These drivers compete in 4-cylinder, [[front-wheel drive]] cars that are completely stock, except for windshields and glass that have been removed. These young drivers learn driving skills, basic car maintenance, and [[sportsmanship]], while spending quality time with their families.\n\nEach of the different classes of cars, compete for points, and all competitors, including he Twister class, compete throughout the year for the Championship at the end of the season. Season-end also brings the annual two-day race, and any special shows that are planned. The end-of-season shows always bring cars and fans from all around the state and lots of exciting racing action. There is space for overnight camping during our two-day shows, and the drivers are always anxious to spend time talking to their fans during the extended weekend.\n\n==Track Champions==\n\n===2010 Champions===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He theorized a heritable component in altruism and developed ''Genetic Similarity Theory'', which is an extension of [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[kin selection]]. It holds that individuals tend to be more altruistic to individuals who are genetically similar to themselves even if they are not kin, and less altruistic, and sometimes outwardly hostile, to individuals who are less genetically similar. Rushton describes \"ethnic conflict and rivalry\" as \"one of the great themes of historical and contemporary society\", and suggests that this may have its roots in the evolutionary impact on individuals from groups \"giving preferential treatment to genetically similar others\". He says \"the makeup of a gene pool [i.e., a human population's total reservoir of alternative genes] causally affects the probability of any particular ideology being adopted\".\n\nA number of articles in a 1989 issue of ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' criticized the theory. Judith Anderson said his work was based on statistically flawed evidence,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Judith | year = 1989 | title = A methodological critique of the evidence for genetic similarity detection | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 518 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00057332}}</ref> John Archer and others said that Rushton failed to understand and misapplied the theory of kin selection,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Archer | first1 = John | year = 1989 | title = Why help friends when you can help sisters and brothers? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 519 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00057344}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Daly | first1 = Martin | year = 1989 | title = On distinguishing evolved adaptation from epiphenomena | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| page = 520 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00057356}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tooby | first1 = John | last2 = Cosmides | first2 = Leda | year = 1989 | title = Kin selection, genic selection, and information-dependent strategies | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 542\u201344 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00057605}}</ref> Judith Economos said he was speculative and failed to define the concept of altruistic behavior in a way that it can become manifest and failed to show any plausible mechanism by which members of a species can detect the \"altruism gene\" in other members of the species,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Economos | first1 = Judith | year = 1989 | title = Altruism, nativism, chauvinism, racism, schism, and jizzum | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 521\u201323 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x0005737x}}</ref> and Steven Gangestad criticized the theory for not being compelling in terms of its attractiveness as an explanatory model,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gangestad | first1 = Steven W | year = 1989 | title = Uncompelling theory, uncompelling data | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 525\u201326 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00057411}}</ref> C.R.

He first published this theory in 1984. Rushton argues that East Asians and their descendants average a larger brain size, greater intelligence, more sexual restraint, slower rates of maturation, and greater law abidingness and social organization than do Europeans and their descendants, who average higher scores on these dimensions than Africans and their descendants.  He theorizes that ''r''/''K'' selection theory explains these differences.\n\nRushton's application of ''r''/''K'' selection theory to explain differences among racial groups has been widely criticised. One of his many critics is the [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Joseph L. Graves]], who has done extensive testing of the ''r''/''K'' selection theory with species of [[Drosophila]] flies. Graves argues that not only is ''r''/''K'' selection theory considered to be virtually useless when applied to human life history evolution, but Rushton does not apply the theory correctly, and displays a lack of understanding of evolutionary theory in general.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Graves | first=J.

It is not science but advocacy, and advocacy for the promotion of \"racialism.\" Tzvetan Todorov explains \"racialism,\" in contrast to \"racism,\" as belief in the existence of typological essences called \"races\" whose characteristics can be rated in hierarchical fashion (''On Human Diversity: Nationalism, Racism, and Exoticism in French Thought,'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993, p. 31). \"Racism,\" then, is the use of racialist assumptions to promote social or political ends, a course that Todorov regards as leading to \"particularly catastrophic results.\" Perpetuating catastrophe is not the stated aim of Rushton's book, but current promoters of racist agendas will almost certainly regard it as a welcome weapon to apply for their noxious purposes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Brace| first=C Loring | authorlink=C.

He theorized a heritable component in altruism and developed ''Genetic Similarity Theory'', which is an extension of [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[kin selection]]. It holds that individuals tend to be more altruistic to individuals who are genetically similar to themselves even if they are not kin, and less altruistic, and sometimes outwardly hostile, to individuals who are less genetically similar. Rushton describes \"ethnic conflict and rivalry\" as \"one of the great themes of historical and contemporary society\", and suggests that this may have its roots in the evolutionary impact on individuals from groups \"giving preferential treatment to genetically similar others\".

He first published this theory in 1984. Rushton argues that East Asians and their descendants average a larger brain size, greater intelligence, more sexual restraint, slower rates of maturation, and greater law abidingness and social organization than do Europeans and their descendants, who average higher scores on these dimensions than Africans and their descendants.  He theorizes that ''r''/''K'' selection theory explains these differences.\n\nRushton's application of ''r''/''K'' selection theory to explain differences among racial groups has been widely criticised. One of his many critics is the [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Joseph L. Graves]], who has done extensive testing of the ''r''/''K'' selection theory with species of [[Drosophila]] flies. Graves argues that not only is ''r''/''K'' selection theory considered to be virtually useless when applied to human life history evolution, but Rushton does not apply the theory correctly, and displays a lack of understanding of evolutionary theory in general.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Graves | first=J.

They are primarily employed in the [[Screening (tactical)|screening]] and [[reconnaissance]] role or in a fire support role of [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary forces]] where big [[main battle tank]]s cannot be made available or can't operate safely. Early light tanks were generally better armed and armored than [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]], but used tracks in order to provide better cross-country mobility.\n\nThe fast light tank was a major feature of the pre-World War II buildup, where it was expected they would be used to exploit breakthroughs in enemy lines created by slower, heavier tanks. Numerous small tank designs and \"[[tankette]]s\" were developed during this period and known under a variety of names, including the \"[[M1 Combat Car|combat car]]\".\n\nThe light tank has been one of the few tank variants to survive the development of the [[main battle tank]], and has seen use in a variety of roles including the support of light [[Airborne forces|airborne]] or [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] forces and reconnaissance. Modified [[IFV]]s are assuming these roles in many militaries due to their immediate availability, and as a cheaper alternative to developing and fielding a pure light tank.\n\n==History==\n===20th century===\n====World War I====\n[[File:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]\nIn [[World War I]], industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, designed the first practical light tanks in 1916, a class largely neglected by the British. It would be [[Renault]]'s small tank design the [[Renault FT|FT]], incorporating a proper{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full rotation. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly modern tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \"box tanks\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. The FT would have the largest production run of any tank of the war - with over 3,700 built (most of those in 1918) it was more numerous than all British and German tanks combined.{{efn-lr|By comparison the French built about 800 medium and heavy tanks in total. The British built about 2,500 heavy tanks and 100 medium tanks during the war.}}\n\n====Interwar====\n[[File:Light Tank Mark V.jpg|thumb|British light tank Mk V]]\n[[File:Type 95 (AWM 097336).jpg|thumb|[[Type 95 Ha-Go]] tanks in [[New Britain]] following the Japanese surrender]]\nThe [[Carden Loyd tankette]] and its derivatives were adopted by several nations as small tracked vehicles carrying a machine gun for armament. At a time of limited military budgets, [[tankette]]s were relatively cheap and functioned as reconnaissance vehicles and mobile machine gun posts. In 1928, the British firm of [[Vickers-Armstrong]] started promoting another design by John Carden and Vivien Loyd as the \"[[Vickers 6-Ton|six-ton tank]]\". Although rejected by the British Army, it was bought by a large number of nations in small numbers. It formed the basis of the Soviet [[T-26]] (around 10,000 built) and the Polish [[7TP]] tank and influenced the Italian [[Fiat M11/39]]. The British Army did not use the design as a light tank themselves but a developed version of the Carden-Loyd tankette as the starting point for [[Light tanks of the United Kingdom|a series of British light tanks]] intended for use in imperial policing and expeditionary warfare. As the only tank fit for immediate manufacture, it was a key element in the expansion of the British Army in the period leading up to the outbreak of war.<ref>Harris, J.P. (1995).

Manchester University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-4814-2}}. p275</ref>\n\nIn general, French tanks of the 1930s were well-armored, innovative vehicles that owed little to foreign designs. However, the light tanks lacked firepower and almost all French tanks were handicapped by their one-man turrets, even the larger tanks such as the [[Char B1]], which overworked the commander who, besides directing the vehicle, or even a troop, had to load and aim the turret gun. The lack of radios with the light tanks was not seen as a major drawback, since French doctrine called for slow-paced, deliberate maneuvers in close conformance to plans. The role of small unit leaders was to execute plans, not to take the initiative in combat.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In 1939, a belated effort was made to improve flexibility and increase the number of radios.\n\nThroughout the interwar period the US produced only a few hundred tanks. From the end of [[World War I]] to 1935, only 15 tanks were produced. Most were derivatives or foreign designs or very poor quality private designs. The [[J. Walter Christie|Christie]] designs were among the few better examples, but the US Army acquired only three Christies and did not pursue the idea any further. Budget limitations and the low priority given to the army meant that there were few resources for building tanks. The US Army instead developed and tested tank components such as suspensions, tracks, and transmissions. This paid off when production had to be initiated on the outbreak of war.\n\n====World War II====\n[[File:Panzer I Norway.PNG|thumb|German [[Panzer I]] in combat during the German invasion of Norway]]\n\n===== Soviet =====\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[BT tank]]s{{citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=OR?

Their only drawback were their [[petrol]] engines which caught fire often and easily during the [[Nomonhan]] fighting which lasted from about May through September 1939.<ref>Coox p. 437, 998</ref> The Japanese [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tank was equipped with a [[diesel engine|diesel]] engine, and although mounting a 37&nbsp;mm cannon, it was a low velocity gun with a maximum effective range of about 700 meters. However, this conflict would be instrumental in developing the famous [[T-34]] medium tank.\n\n===== Germany =====\nGermany's armored [[Panzer]] force was not especially impressive at the start of the war. In the invasions [[Invasion of Poland|of Poland]] and [[Battle of France|France]], the German forces were mostly made up of the [[Panzer I]] and [[Panzer II]] light tanks. The Panzer I was little more than a training vehicle armed only with machine guns, the Panzer II with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon. The Panzer division also included some [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] designed light tanks - the [[Panzer 35(t)]] and the [[Panzer 38(t)]].\n\n===== American =====\nAmerican light tank development started with the [[M2 light tank]] series. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette, and only a few saw combat. The [[M3 Stuart]] series was an improvement of the M2 with better armor. The new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2A1. This was a poor design with thin armor and a high silhouette.\n\nThe M3 Stuart saw use in the [[North African Campaign]] but was relegated to reconnaissance as soon as US-built medium tanks became available. Further light tank development in the war led to the improved M5 Stuart and then included the [[M24 Chaffee]].\n\n===== British =====\nThe British withdrew their light tank designs from their armoured divisions early in the war, but used some later designs for minor amphibious operations and airborne operations.<ref>Flint, Keith (2006).

The Soviet [[PT-76]] is a specialized light tank -amphibious with sufficient firepower to engage other reconnaissance vehicles, but very lightly armored. The US fielded small numbers of the [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] with a high velocity 76mm gun, and better armor, but it suffered from range limits, and its weight was too heavy for most air transport of the day. The US [[M551 Sheridan]] had similar strengths and weaknesses, but could also be airdropped, either by parachute or [[LAPES]].

They are primarily employed in the [[Screening (tactical)|screening]] and [[reconnaissance]] role or in a fire support role of [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary forces]] where big [[main battle tank]]s cannot be made available or can't operate safely. Early light tanks were generally better armed and armored than [[Armored car (military)|armored car]], but used tracks in order to provide better cross-country mobility.\n\nThe fast light tank was a major feature of the pre-World War II buildup, where it was expected they would be used to exploit breakthroughs in enemy lines created by slower, heavier tanks. Numerous small tank designs and \"[[tankette]]s\" were developed during this period and known under a variety of names, including the \"[[M1 Combat Car|combat car]]\".\n\nThe light tank has been one of the few tank variants to survive the development of the [[main battle tank]], and has seen use in a variety of roles including the support of light [[Airborne forces|airborne]] or [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] forces and reconnaissance. Modified [[IFV]]s are assuming these roles in many militaries due to their immediate availability, and as a cheaper alternative to developing and fielding a pure light tank.\n\n==History==\n===20th century===\n====World War I====\n[[File:FT-17-argonne-1918.gif|thumb|US Army operating Renault FT tanks]]\nIn [[World War I]], industrial initiative also led to swift advances. The car industry, already used to vehicle mass production and having much more experience in vehicle layout, designed the first practical light tanks in 1916, a class largely neglected by the British. It would be [[Renault]]'s small tank design the [[Renault FT|FT]], incorporating a proper{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} climbing face for the tracks, that was the first tank to incorporate a top-mounted turret with a full rotation. In fact the FT was in many respects the first truly modern tank having a layout that has been followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear. Previous models had been \"box tanks\", with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver's cabin. The FT would have the largest production run of any tank of the war - with over 3,700 built (most of those in 1918) it was more numerous than all British and German tanks combined.{{efn-lr|By comparison the French built about 800 medium and heavy tanks in total. The British built about 2,500 heavy tanks and 100 medium tanks during the war.}}\n\n====Interwar====\n[[File:Light Tank Mark V.jpg|thumb|British light tank Mk V]]\n[[File:Type 95 (AWM 097336).jpg|thumb|[[Type 95 Ha-Go]] tanks in [[New Britain]] following the Japanese surrender]]\nThe [[Carden Loyd tankette]] and its derivatives were adopted by several nations as small tracked vehicles carrying a machine gun for armament. At a time of limited military budgets, [[tankette]]s were relatively cheap and functioned as reconnaissance vehicles and mobile machine gun posts. In 1928, the British firm of [[Vickers-Armstrong]] started promoting another design by John Carden and Vivien Loyd as the \"[[Vickers 6-Ton|six-ton tank]]\". Although rejected by the British Army, it was bought by a large number of nations in small numbers. It formed the basis of the Soviet [[T-26]] (around 10,000 built) and the Polish [[7TP]] tank and influenced the Italian [[Fiat M11/39]]. The British Army did not use the design as a light tank themselves but a developed version of the Carden-Loyd tankette as the starting point for [[Light tanks of the United Kingdom|a series of British light tanks]] intended for use in imperial policing and expeditionary warfare. As the only tank fit for immediate manufacture, it was a key element in the expansion of the British Army in the period leading up to the outbreak of war.<ref>Harris, J.P. (1995). ''Men, Ideas, and Tanks: British Military Thought and Armoured Forces, 1903-1939''. Manchester University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7190-4814-2}}. p275</ref>\n\nIn general, French tanks of the 1930s were well-armored, innovative vehicles that owed little to foreign designs. However, the light tanks lacked firepower and almost all French tanks were handicapped by their one-man turrets, even the larger tanks such as the [[Char B1]], which overworked the commander who, besides directing the vehicle, or even a troop, had to load and aim the turret gun. The lack of radios with the light tanks was not seen as a major drawback, since French doctrine called for slow-paced, deliberate maneuvers in close conformance to plans. The role of small unit leaders was to execute plans, not to take the initiative in combat.{{cn|date=June 2019}} In 1939, a belated effort was made to improve flexibility and increase the number of radios.\n\nThroughout the interwar period the US produced only a few hundred tanks. From the end of [[World War I]] to 1935, only 15 tanks were produced. Most were derivatives or foreign designs or very poor quality private designs. The [[J. Walter Christie|Christie]] designs were among the few better examples, but the US Army acquired only three Christies and did not pursue the idea any further. Budget limitations and the low priority given to the army meant that there were few resources for building tanks. The US Army instead developed and tested tank components such as suspensions, tracks, and transmissions. This paid off when production had to be initiated on the outbreak of war.\n\n====World War II====\n[[File:Panzer I Norway.PNG|thumb|German [[Panzer I]] in combat during the German invasion of Norway]]\n\n===== Soviet =====\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[BT tank]]s{{citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=OR? Soviets considered fast tanks a separate class from light tanks. Tactical usage was different: BT in pre-war Mechanized Corps (along T-34 and KV and T-28), and T-26 assigned mostly to infantry corps. The very designation BT- again suggests that Soviets treated it as a totally separate class from all other T- tanks.}} were the most advanced in the 1930s, extremely fast and mounting high velocity 45&nbsp;mm cannons. Their only drawback were their [[petrol]] engines which caught fire often and easily during the [[Nomonhan]] fighting which lasted from about May through September 1939.<ref>Coox p. 437, 998</ref> The Japanese [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tank was equipped with a [[diesel engine|diesel]] engine, and although mounting a 37&nbsp;mm cannon, it was a low velocity gun with a maximum effective range of about 700 meters. However, this conflict would be instrumental in developing the famous [[T-34]] medium tank.\n\n===== Germany =====\nGermany's armored [[Panzer]] force was not especially impressive at the start of the war. In the invasions [[Invasion of Poland|of Poland]] and [[Battle of France|France]], the German forces were mostly made up of the [[Panzer I]] and [[Panzer II]] light tanks. The Panzer I was little more than a training vehicle armed only with machine guns, the Panzer II with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon. The Panzer division also included some [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] designed light tanks - the [[Panzer 35(t)]] and the [[Panzer 38(t)]].\n\n===== American =====\nAmerican light tank development started with the [[M2 light tank]] series. These light tanks were mechanically very reliable, with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette, and only a few saw combat. The [[M3 Stuart]] series was an improvement of the M2 with better armor. The new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2A1. This was a poor design with thin armor and a high silhouette.\n\nThe M3 Stuart saw use in the [[North African Campaign]] but was relegated to reconnaissance as soon as US-built medium tanks became available. Further light tank development in the war led to the improved M5 Stuart and then included the [[M24 Chaffee]].\n\n===== British =====\nThe British withdrew their light tank designs from their armoured divisions early in the war, but used some later designs for minor amphibious operations and airborne operations.<ref>Flint, Keith (2006).

The Soviet [[PT-76]] is a specialized light tank -amphibious with sufficient firepower to engage other reconnaissance vehicles, but very lightly armored. The US fielded small numbers of the [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] with a high velocity 76mm gun, and better armor, but it suffered from range limits, and its weight was too heavy for most air transport of the day. The US [[M551 Sheridan]] had similar strengths and weaknesses, but could also be airdropped, either by parachute or [[LAPES]]. The French had their [[AMX-13]] light tank, which was designed for its capability to be quickly air-dropped for use with paratroopers and also able to support lightly-armed infantry and perform force-reconnaissance effectively.\n\nThe British [[FV101 Scorpion]], the fire support variant of the [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] series of vehicles that replaced armored cars in British service, has been described as a light tank and was sold to many smaller nations.
