The Small Business Act was originally enacted as the \"Small Business Act of 1953\" in Title II ({{USStat|67|232}}) of {{USPL|83|163}} (ch. 282, {{USStat|67|230}}, July 30, 1953); The \"Reconstruction Finance Corporation Liquidation Act\" was Title I, which abolished the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC). The Small Business Act Amendments of 1958 ({{USStatute|85|536|72|384|1958|07|18}}) withdrew Title II as part of that act and made it a separate act to be known as the \"Small Business Act\". Its function was and is to \"aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns\".\n\nThe SBA has survived a number of threats to its existence.

It has increased jobs for thousands of people across the Nation, and many of the successful firms had impacted their communities with internships, college funding, and more.  Annually, of the governments $99B in small business contracts, 8(a) firms are awarded 5% of contracts.  \n\nIn 2011, the SBA, along with the [[FBI]] and the [[IRS]], uncovered a massive scheme to defraud this program.

Applicants must provide evidence of economic disadvantage (net worth under $250,000K), and must write a statement of personal experiences in combination with evidence to sufficiently demonstrate social disadvantage.  The following groups are presumed [[socially disadvantaged]] through SBA policy and do not have to submit a social disadvantage narrative when applying for the program:  Black Americans; Hispanic Americans; Native Americans (American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts, or Native Hawaiians); Asian Pacific Americans (persons with origins from Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Japan, China (including Hong Kong), Taiwan, Laos, Cambodia (Kampuchea), Vietnam, Korea, The Philippines, U.S. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Republic of Palau), Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Samoa, Macao, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu, or Nauru); Subcontinent Asian Americans (persons with origins from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, the Maldives Islands or Nepal). \n\nThe 8(a) Program opens the doors for disadvantaged firms to grow and develop for a period of 9-years.  It has increased jobs for thousands of people across the Nation, and many of the successful firms had impacted their communities with internships, college funding, and more.  Annually, of the governments $99B in small business contracts, 8(a) firms are awarded 5% of contracts.  \n\nIn 2011, the SBA, along with the [[FBI]] and the [[IRS]], uncovered a massive scheme to defraud this program. Civilian employees of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], working in concert with an employee of [[Alaska Native Corporation]] ''Eyak Technology LLC'' allegedly submitted fraudulent bills to the program, totaling over 20 million dollars, and kept the money for their own use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskapublic.org/2011/10/04/eyak-technology-llc-director-arrested-in-major-bribery-case/|title=EyakTek Director Arrested in Major Bribery Case|author=LibCasey, C-SPAN|date=October 4, 2011|work=Alaska Public Media|accessdate=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605134320/http://www.alaskapublic.org/2011/10/04/eyak-technology-llc-director-arrested-in-major-bribery-case/|archive-date=June 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nThe [[Cato Institute]] has challenged the justification of the federal government in intervening in credit markets.<ref name=\"cato\">{{cite web|title=Terminating the Small Business Administration|publisher=Cato Institute|date=August 2011|url=http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/sba|accessdate=August 23, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826155844/http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/sba|archive-date=August 26, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cato.org/blog/terminating-small-business-administration-reader-response Terminating the Small Business Administration \u2013 Reader Response | Cato @ Liberty] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231546/http://www.cato.org/blog/terminating-small-business-administration-reader-response |date=December 2, 2013 }}.

As a [[techno-thriller]], it comments on the possibilities inherent in [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], and is critical of [[museum]]s and their role both in society and in the scientific community.  It is the basis of the film ''[[The Relic (film)|The Relic]]'' (1997).\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the [[Amazon Basin]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[rainforest]], in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in the process learn more about their culture, including their [[lizard]] god Mbwun (\"He Who Walks On All Fours\"), supposedly the son of [[Satan]]. However, Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his partner, Crocker, and realizes that a creature in [[the bush]] is stalking him. A year later, in [[Belem]], a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from Whittlesey's expedition.\n\nSeven years later, in a fictionalized version of [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum. [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Vincent D'Agosta]] leads the subsequent investigation. He has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff placed under curfew, for fear the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or the many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders under wraps, as the grand gala opening of the new \"Superstition\" exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer, an event that will feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even hires ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the murder investigation but repeatedly edits his reports so they will appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the \"Museum Beast\", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the tunnels under the museum for years and is responsible for the murders. Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the boy's brains.\n\nWhen a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Aloysius Pendergast]] arrives to aid in the investigation, having taken a personal interest in the unique nature of the kills. The investigation intensifies as the gala draws nearer, with the search spreading to the tunnels under the museum. Margo Green and her mentor, Dr. Whitney Frock, initially take little to no interest in the investigation, but Pendergast eventually approaches them when he realizes the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun figurine that had been sent back to the museum in a crate in 1987 and is set to be put on display in the new exhibition. Green, with Smithback's help, manages to get into the secure vault and gain access to some letters that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named H.C. Montague, detailing the struggles the 1987 expedition had been going through. Pendergast then reveals the primary reason for his interest in the case: the nature of the murders of the two boys and the security guard matches the murder of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988, as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year. Pendergast was able to trace back to the one connection among the museum murders, the Louisiana murder, and the Belem murder: the shipment of crates Whittlesey had sent the museum in 1987. However, other than one smaller crate containing the Mbwun figurine, the crates were empty, save massive quantities of local plant leaves apparently used as packaging. Frock reveals that those crates have been moved into the heavily reinforced secure vault as well, and after Green and Smithback's stunt to get the letters, the directors are well aware of their intentions and will never allow them access to the crates. Pendergast hints at the possibility that the murders might not have been committed by a human, and that the Mbwun monster may somehow have been sent to the museum by Whittlesey's shipment.\n\nReading through more of Whittlesey's letters, Green and Smithback discover one other major colleague of Whittlesey's who is still working at the museum, and to whom one of the letters was addressed, Dr. Jorgensen. They ask Jorgensen about the nature of the expedition and its aftermath. Jorgensen explains that Whittlesey was determined to prove that the Kothoga tribe had not gone extinct, and that he had found it at long last on a ''[[tepui]]'' deep in the Brazilian jungle. In addition, Whittlesey had apparently discovered a unique plant at the base of the ''tepui'' that had some kind of protein-like quality to it. However, Whittlesey was being accompanied by a museum bureaucrat simply identified as \"Maxwell\", whose job was to hinder Whittlesey's progress so that the find would not collide with the local government's discovery of an undisclosed natural resource that had been discovered on the ''tepui''. Determined to mine the entire area, the government dropped [[napalm]] on the ''tepui'' in 1988, killing all of the remaining Kothoga and destroying the plant. Jorgensen also reveals that Whittlesey's colleague Montague had disappeared rather suddenly several years ago. Green and Frock soon realize that the plant Whittlesey discovered was the same plant that had been sent back as packaging in the crates, and that Whittlesey had never sent the crates back to the museum empty; that the main content of the crates was the plant itself. The day of the gala, Green and Frock then begin running computer analyses on samples of the plant as well as the claw from the autopsy. The results reveal that the plants are rich in thalamoid hormones, which can also be found in the human [[hypothalamus]] gland, though to a much lesser extent. After reviewing the autopsy reports, Green realizes that what all of the murders - in the museum and in Louisiana and Brazil - all had in common was that the hypothalamus had been ripped out of the victim's heads and was completely missing. The analysis of the claw creates a general caricature of the creature in the question, comprising a primary mix of primate, reptile, and human genes; a nocturnal nature; a strong sense of smell; a quadruped build; a maximum speed of 60-70 km/h; and thick muscle definition and bone structure. Frock describes this hypothetical combination as having the strength of a grizzly bear, the speed of a greyhound, and the intelligence of a human being - the ultimate predator. Frock and Green finally discover the truth behind the entire ordeal, but their efforts to warn their superiors before the gala are thwarted.\n\nAs the investigation ultimately did not produce a suspect, the gala is allowed to begin, with a tightened security presence by the NYPD and the FBI, under the official command of Special Agent Coffey. The exhibition initially appears to be going fine until the body of NYPD officer Fred Beauregard drops down from the rafters above the exhibition and right into the crowd, causing a mass panic. At the same time, an NYPD officer named Waters, assigned to monitor the museum's security control room, hears a strange noise in the generator room (revealed to be merely the air conditioner pump) and opens fire, only to completely destroy the central switching box and shut down the museum's power. This results in the museum's massive, metal security doors automatically closing, separating the museum into five cells and trapping a handful of guests, staff, and security personnel alike inside the museum. When the chaos settles, dozens of people have either been killed by the stampeding crowd or crushed by the closing doors, and the roughly three-dozen who are trapped inside the area where the exhibition is includes D'Agosta, Smithback, Cuthbert, Wright, Rickman, Mayor Harper, museum security director Ippolito, and NYPD officer John Bailey. Coffey and Kawakita manage to make it outside the museum, while Green, Frock, and Pendergast are all in the tunnels under the museum, and all three soon encounter the creature. Pendergast manages to fire a single shot, which simply bounces off the creature's skull.\n\nPendergast manages to communicate with D'Agosta via radio, to warn him about the creature, and explains that the best way for the trapped crowd to escape is down through the museum tunnels, which eventually lead to the sewer systems of New York. The three directors refuse to head down into the tunnels, and instead retreat into Wright's office on the fourth floor. Just as D'Agosta prepares to lead the crowd down the first stairwell, the creature attacks and kills Ippolito and an injured guest. The rest of the crowd manages to escape down into the tunnels. Although extremely skeptical of the consistent reports of a creature's being responsible, Coffey eventually orders a SWAT team to descend into the museum through the skylights, to eliminate the creature. The Mbwun then enters the office where the three directors are hiding, and Cuthbert sends Rickman and a now-drunk Wright into the adjacent dinosaur area to safety, while he draws a pistol to make a stand. However, the creature suddenly leaves him alone and pursues the other two, killing both of them. Cuthbert is rescued by the SWAT team shortly before they move in to attack the creature, only for the entire team to be slaughtered.\n\nThe crowd manages to navigate the tunnels and reaches the sewers just before the creature returns, killing Bailey. They then reach a massive underground chamber that is filled with skeletons and torn meat, presumably the creature's lair. They struggle to stay above the rising water as the storm outside intensifies, and another woman is dragged away by the current and dies, shortly before the crowd finally reaches a manhole and escapes back out onto the streets of New York. Pendergast and Green devise a plan to make a final stand against the creature, with Pendergast hoping to use his old hunting techniques of shooting the creature's legs in order to stop its charge. However, the shots do not penetrate the hide, and the creature closes in. At the last second, Green shouts for Pendergast to shoot through the creature's eye, allowing the bullet to pass straight through the skull and into the brain, which kills it instantly.\n\nIn the epilogue four weeks later, Green, Frock, Kawakita, Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Smithback all convene in Frock's office to discuss the events of that night. Pendergast explains everything in great detail: the Kothoga legend claimed that Mbwun was given to them by Satan in order to slay their enemies in battle, when in actuality, the Kothoga created the Mbwun by feeding a human the strange plant that Whittlesey had discovered and shipped back to the museum. Eating the plant resulted in the human subject's undergoing the transformation process into the creature known as Mbwun, larger, faster, stronger, and slightly smarter. However, the Mbwun subsequently needed a consistent supply of the plant in order to survive, like an addictive drug. When the ''tepui'' where the Kothoga and Mbwun lived was completely destroyed, the Mbwun knew the last surviving samples of the plant were in the crates Whittlesey had shipped back, and thus, it followed the crates all the way to New York. It initially lived off the plants in a steady ration for years, and in the process, killed Montague one day when he came down to investigate the crates. Montague's disappearance was marked by a puddle of blood by the crates, but when it was discovered by Cuthbert, Wright, and Rickman, they washed it away to preserve the museum's reputation. As part of the cover-up, the crates were moved into the heavily fortified vault, moving them permanently out of the Mbwun's reach. Thus, in order to stay alive, it needed the next best substitute: the human hypothalamus. Though it tried its best to keep its existence a secret by living off smaller animals and homeless people in the sewers, it eventually turned to the murders of the boys and the security guard. Even during the police investigation, it could no longer deny its appetite, and thus ran amok during the exhibition. Pendergast also reveals that among the bodies that were found in the lair were the remains of Moriarty and a pendant that Whittlesey had always worn on him, serving as proof that the creature killed both of them. Cuthbert has since been institutionalized, Coffey was demoted and sent to the [[Waco]] field office, and Smithback reveals that he will release a book on the entire event, with half of the money going to a memorial fund for the late Bailey and his family.\n\nIn his lab, Kawakita has realized an horrific truth; the creature didn't kill Whittlesey and take his pendant as a trophy, it actually WAS Whittlesey. He speculates that the Kothoga, having failed with Mbwun using their own people, had decided to feed the plant to a white man instead, hoping the resulting creature would be easier to control. The gamble failed, and Whittlesey was able to survive on the plants for years before their destruction, and he followed his own samples back home to the museum. Thanks to the samples that survived and were analyzed, Kawakita manages to develop a drug that would turn the users into addicts first, then into Mbwun. He begins selling it on the street, reflecting that the Kothoga's problem had been that Mbwun was able to feed on the plants himself whenever he wanted, and so they had no hold over it. Now, as the only person alive capable of making the drug, the creatures would never turn on him; he would have total control over the creatures and succeed where the Kothoga failed.\n\n== Characters (novel) ==\n\n=== Major Characters ===\n* [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Vincent D'Agosta]], a police officer working to solve the murders\n* Margo Green, a graduate student working at the museum\n* Dr. Frock, Green's advisor and department head at the museum\n* William Smithback, Jr., an ambitious [[journalist]] who is writing a book about the exhibition for the museum\n* [[Aloysius Pendergast|Special Agent Aloysius X.

As a [[techno-thriller]], it comments on the possibilities inherent in [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], and is critical of [[museum]]s and their role both in society and in the scientific community.  It is the basis of the film ''[[The Relic (film)|The Relic]]'' (1997).\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the [[Amazon Basin]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[rainforest]], in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in the process learn more about their culture, including their [[lizard]] god Mbwun (\"He Who Walks On All Fours\"), supposedly the son of [[Satan]]. However, Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his partner, Crocker, and realizes that a creature in [[the bush]] is stalking him. A year later, in [[Belem]], a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from Whittlesey's expedition.\n\nSeven years later, in a fictionalized version of [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum. [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Vincent D'Agosta]] leads the subsequent investigation. He has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff placed under curfew, for fear the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or the many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders under wraps, as the grand gala opening of the new \"Superstition\" exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer, an event that will feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even hires ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the murder investigation but repeatedly edits his reports so they will appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the \"Museum Beast\", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the tunnels under the museum for years and is responsible for the murders. Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the boy's brains.\n\nWhen a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Aloysius Pendergast]] arrives to aid in the investigation, having taken a personal interest in the unique nature of the kills. The investigation intensifies as the gala draws nearer, with the search spreading to the tunnels under the museum. Margo Green and her mentor, Dr. Whitney Frock, initially take little to no interest in the investigation, but Pendergast eventually approaches them when he realizes the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun figurine that had been sent back to the museum in a crate in 1987 and is set to be put on display in the new exhibition. Green, with Smithback's help, manages to get into the secure vault and gain access to some letters that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named H.C. Montague, detailing the struggles the 1987 expedition had been going through. Pendergast then reveals the primary reason for his interest in the case: the nature of the murders of the two boys and the security guard matches the murder of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988, as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year. Pendergast was able to trace back to the one connection among the museum murders, the Louisiana murder, and the Belem murder: the shipment of crates Whittlesey had sent the museum in 1987. However, other than one smaller crate containing the Mbwun figurine, the crates were empty, save massive quantities of local plant leaves apparently used as packaging. Frock reveals that those crates have been moved into the heavily reinforced secure vault as well, and after Green and Smithback's stunt to get the letters, the directors are well aware of their intentions and will never allow them access to the crates. Pendergast hints at the possibility that the murders might not have been committed by a human, and that the Mbwun monster may somehow have been sent to the museum by Whittlesey's shipment.\n\nReading through more of Whittlesey's letters, Green and Smithback discover one other major colleague of Whittlesey's who is still working at the museum, and to whom one of the letters was addressed, Dr. Jorgensen. They ask Jorgensen about the nature of the expedition and its aftermath. Jorgensen explains that Whittlesey was determined to prove that the Kothoga tribe had not gone extinct, and that he had found it at long last on a ''[[tepui]]'' deep in the Brazilian jungle. In addition, Whittlesey had apparently discovered a unique plant at the base of the ''tepui'' that had some kind of protein-like quality to it. However, Whittlesey was being accompanied by a museum bureaucrat simply identified as \"Maxwell\", whose job was to hinder Whittlesey's progress so that the find would not collide with the local government's discovery of an undisclosed natural resource that had been discovered on the ''tepui''. Determined to mine the entire area, the government dropped [[napalm]] on the ''tepui'' in 1988, killing all of the remaining Kothoga and destroying the plant. Jorgensen also reveals that Whittlesey's colleague Montague had disappeared rather suddenly several years ago. Green and Frock soon realize that the plant Whittlesey discovered was the same plant that had been sent back as packaging in the crates, and that Whittlesey had never sent the crates back to the museum empty; that the main content of the crates was the plant itself. The day of the gala, Green and Frock then begin running computer analyses on samples of the plant as well as the claw from the autopsy. The results reveal that the plants are rich in thalamoid hormones, which can also be found in the human [[hypothalamus]] gland, though to a much lesser extent. After reviewing the autopsy reports, Green realizes that what all of the murders - in the museum and in Louisiana and Brazil - all had in common was that the hypothalamus had been ripped out of the victim's heads and was completely missing. The analysis of the claw creates a general caricature of the creature in the question, comprising a primary mix of primate, reptile, and human genes; a nocturnal nature; a strong sense of smell; a quadruped build; a maximum speed of 60-70 km/h; and thick muscle definition and bone structure. Frock describes this hypothetical combination as having the strength of a grizzly bear, the speed of a greyhound, and the intelligence of a human being - the ultimate predator. Frock and Green finally discover the truth behind the entire ordeal, but their efforts to warn their superiors before the gala are thwarted.\n\nAs the investigation ultimately did not produce a suspect, the gala is allowed to begin, with a tightened security presence by the NYPD and the FBI, under the official command of Special Agent Coffey. The exhibition initially appears to be going fine until the body of NYPD officer Fred Beauregard drops down from the rafters above the exhibition and right into the crowd, causing a mass panic. At the same time, an NYPD officer named Waters, assigned to monitor the museum's security control room, hears a strange noise in the generator room (revealed to be merely the air conditioner pump) and opens fire, only to completely destroy the central switching box and shut down the museum's power. This results in the museum's massive, metal security doors automatically closing, separating the museum into five cells and trapping a handful of guests, staff, and security personnel alike inside the museum. When the chaos settles, dozens of people have either been killed by the stampeding crowd or crushed by the closing doors, and the roughly three-dozen who are trapped inside the area where the exhibition is includes D'Agosta, Smithback, Cuthbert, Wright, Rickman, Mayor Harper, museum security director Ippolito, and NYPD officer John Bailey. Coffey and Kawakita manage to make it outside the museum, while Green, Frock, and Pendergast are all in the tunnels under the museum, and all three soon encounter the creature. Pendergast manages to fire a single shot, which simply bounces off the creature's skull.\n\nPendergast manages to communicate with D'Agosta via radio, to warn him about the creature, and explains that the best way for the trapped crowd to escape is down through the museum tunnels, which eventually lead to the sewer systems of New York. The three directors refuse to head down into the tunnels, and instead retreat into Wright's office on the fourth floor. Just as D'Agosta prepares to lead the crowd down the first stairwell, the creature attacks and kills Ippolito and an injured guest. The rest of the crowd manages to escape down into the tunnels. Although extremely skeptical of the consistent reports of a creature's being responsible, Coffey eventually orders a SWAT team to descend into the museum through the skylights, to eliminate the creature. The Mbwun then enters the office where the three directors are hiding, and Cuthbert sends Rickman and a now-drunk Wright into the adjacent dinosaur area to safety, while he draws a pistol to make a stand. However, the creature suddenly leaves him alone and pursues the other two, killing both of them. Cuthbert is rescued by the SWAT team shortly before they move in to attack the creature, only for the entire team to be slaughtered.\n\nThe crowd manages to navigate the tunnels and reaches the sewers just before the creature returns, killing Bailey. They then reach a massive underground chamber that is filled with skeletons and torn meat, presumably the creature's lair. They struggle to stay above the rising water as the storm outside intensifies, and another woman is dragged away by the current and dies, shortly before the crowd finally reaches a manhole and escapes back out onto the streets of New York. Pendergast and Green devise a plan to make a final stand against the creature, with Pendergast hoping to use his old hunting techniques of shooting the creature's legs in order to stop its charge. However, the shots do not penetrate the hide, and the creature closes in. At the last second, Green shouts for Pendergast to shoot through the creature's eye, allowing the bullet to pass straight through the skull and into the brain, which kills it instantly.\n\nIn the epilogue four weeks later, Green, Frock, Kawakita, Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Smithback all convene in Frock's office to discuss the events of that night. Pendergast explains everything in great detail: the Kothoga legend claimed that Mbwun was given to them by Satan in order to slay their enemies in battle, when in actuality, the Kothoga created the Mbwun by feeding a human the strange plant that Whittlesey had discovered and shipped back to the museum. Eating the plant resulted in the human subject's undergoing the transformation process into the creature known as Mbwun, larger, faster, stronger, and slightly smarter. However, the Mbwun subsequently needed a consistent supply of the plant in order to survive, like an addictive drug. When the ''tepui'' where the Kothoga and Mbwun lived was completely destroyed, the Mbwun knew the last surviving samples of the plant were in the crates Whittlesey had shipped back, and thus, it followed the crates all the way to New York. It initially lived off the plants in a steady ration for years, and in the process, killed Montague one day when he came down to investigate the crates. Montague's disappearance was marked by a puddle of blood by the crates, but when it was discovered by Cuthbert, Wright, and Rickman, they washed it away to preserve the museum's reputation. As part of the cover-up, the crates were moved into the heavily fortified vault, moving them permanently out of the Mbwun's reach. Thus, in order to stay alive, it needed the next best substitute: the human hypothalamus. Though it tried its best to keep its existence a secret by living off smaller animals and homeless people in the sewers, it eventually turned to the murders of the boys and the security guard. Even during the police investigation, it could no longer deny its appetite, and thus ran amok during the exhibition. Pendergast also reveals that among the bodies that were found in the lair were the remains of Moriarty and a pendant that Whittlesey had always worn on him, serving as proof that the creature killed both of them. Cuthbert has since been institutionalized, Coffey was demoted and sent to the [[Waco]] field office, and Smithback reveals that he will release a book on the entire event, with half of the money going to a memorial fund for the late Bailey and his family.\n\nIn his lab, Kawakita has realized an horrific truth; the creature didn't kill Whittlesey and take his pendant as a trophy, it actually WAS Whittlesey. He speculates that the Kothoga, having failed with Mbwun using their own people, had decided to feed the plant to a white man instead, hoping the resulting creature would be easier to control. The gamble failed, and Whittlesey was able to survive on the plants for years before their destruction, and he followed his own samples back home to the museum. Thanks to the samples that survived and were analyzed, Kawakita manages to develop a drug that would turn the users into addicts first, then into Mbwun. He begins selling it on the street, reflecting that the Kothoga's problem had been that Mbwun was able to feed on the plants himself whenever he wanted, and so they had no hold over it. Now, as the only person alive capable of making the drug, the creatures would never turn on him; he would have total control over the creatures and succeed where the Kothoga failed.\n\n== Characters (novel) ==\n\n=== Major Characters ===\n* [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Vincent D'Agosta]], a police officer working to solve the murders\n* Margo Green, a graduate student working at the museum\n* Dr. Frock, Green's advisor and department head at the museum\n* William Smithback, Jr., an ambitious [[journalist]] who is writing a book about the exhibition for the museum\n* [[Aloysius Pendergast|Special Agent Aloysius X.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

Berlin had defeated Barcelona, which was also vying to host the games, by 43 votes to 16. During the same year, Spain had adopted a [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|republican constitution]], with [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] going into exile, and Catalonia was declared an autonomous region inside the new Spanish Republic.\n\nFollowing the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 general election]] in Spain, the newly elected [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government (which included the [[Communist Party of Spain]]) decided that Spain would boycott the Berlin Olympics in [[Germany]], which was now under [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[NSDAP]] government, and host its own games. Invitations were made to many different countries, and it was planned to use the hotels built for the [[1929 Barcelona International Exposition]] as an [[Olympic Village|Olympic-style Village]]. The games were scheduled to be held from July 19 to 26 and would have therefore ended six days prior to the start of the Berlin games. In addition to the usual sporting events, the Barcelona games would also have featured [[chess]], folkdancing, music and theatre.\n\nA total of 6,000 athletes from 22 nations registered for the games. The largest contingents of athletes came from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[French colonization of Algeria|French Algeria]]. There were also teams from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] made up of political exiles from those countries. Teams representing Jewish exiles, [[Alsace]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] also registered. The [[Soviet Union]], under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], had been holding its own version of the Olympics, known as the [[Spartakiad]], organised by [[Red Sport International]]. Despite this, the Soviets agreed to attend the Barcelona competition.\n\nMany of the athletes were sent by [[trade union]]s, workers' clubs and associations, [[socialism|socialist]] and [[communism|communist]] parties, and left-wing groups, rather than by state-sponsored committees.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just as the games were to begin, the alternate games were hastily cancelled. Some athletes never made it to Barcelona as the borders had been closed, while many who were in the city for the beginning of the games made a hasty exit. However, at least 200 of the athletes, such as [[Clara Thalmann]], remained in Spain and joined workers' [[militia]]s that were organized to defend the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the nationalists.<ref>[[Antony Beevor]].

In addition to the usual sporting events, the Barcelona games would also have featured [[chess]], folkdancing, music and theatre.\n\nA total of 6,000 athletes from 22 nations registered for the games. The largest contingents of athletes came from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[French colonization of Algeria|French Algeria]]. There were also teams from [[Germany]] and [[Italy]] made up of political exiles from those countries. Teams representing Jewish exiles, [[Alsace]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] also registered. The [[Soviet Union]], under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], had been holding its own version of the Olympics, known as the [[Spartakiad]], organised by [[Red Sport International]]. Despite this, the Soviets agreed to attend the Barcelona competition.\n\nMany of the athletes were sent by [[trade union]]s, workers' clubs and associations, [[socialism|socialist]] and [[communism|communist]] parties, and left-wing groups, rather than by state-sponsored committees.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just as the games were to begin, the alternate games were hastily cancelled. Some athletes never made it to Barcelona as the borders had been closed, while many who were in the city for the beginning of the games made a hasty exit. However, at least 200 of the athletes, such as [[Clara Thalmann]], remained in Spain and joined workers' [[militia]]s that were organized to defend the [[Second Spanish Republic]] against the nationalists.<ref>[[Antony Beevor]].

Fifteen artworks are generally attributed either in whole or in large part to him. However, it is believed that he made many more, only for them to be lost over the years or remain unidentified. <!--Most are paintings on panel, with the remainder being a mural, a large drawing on paper, and two works in the early stages of preparation.-->The authorship of several paintings traditionally attributed to Leonardo is disputed. Two major works are known only as copies. Works are regularly attributed to Leonardo with varying degrees of credibility. None of Leonardo's paintings are signed. The attributions here draw on the opinions of various scholars.<ref name= Chiesa>{{Cite book\n | first = Angela Ottino\n | last = della Chiesa\n | title = The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci\n | year = 1967\n | publisher = Penguin\n | isbn = 978-0-14-008649-2\n | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\nThe small number of surviving paintings is due in part to Leonardo's frequently disastrous experimentation with new techniques and his chronic [[procrastination]]. Nevertheless, these few works together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, comprise a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, [[Michelangelo]].\n<!--- The first set of {{Ntsh}} parameters gives the painting's surface in cm squared.\n      The second set, going from 01 to 21, places the works in their chronological order.\n      The third set sorts the paintings according to the strength of their attribution to Leonardo.
