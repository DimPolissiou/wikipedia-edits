Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections.

PHP&nbsp;5 introduced ''type hinting'' that allows functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific class, arrays, interfaces or [[callback function]]s. However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted (\"\") and [[heredoc]] strings provide the ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.php|title=Variables |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP treats [[newline]]s as [[whitespace character|whitespace]] in the manner of a [[free-form language]], and statements are terminated by a semicolon.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/basic-syntax.instruction-separation|title=Instruction separation |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has three types of [[comparison of programming languages (syntax)#Comments|comment syntax]]: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>/* */</syntaxhighlight> marks block and inline comments; <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>//</syntaxhighlight> or <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>#</syntaxhighlight> are used for one-line comments.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.comments.php|title=Comments |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> The <code>echo</code> statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text.\n\nIn terms of keywords and language syntax, PHP is similar to the C style syntax. <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>if</syntaxhighlight> conditions, <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>for</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>while</syntaxhighlight> loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.\n\n=== Data types ===\nPHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either as a 32, 64 or 128-bit [[signed number representations|signed]] [[integer (computer science)|integer]] equivalent to the [[C variable types and declarations|C-language long type]]. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations, which is different behavior to many other programming languages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2007/03/27/integers-in-php-running-with-scissors-and-portability/ | title = Integers in PHP, running with scissors, and portability | date = March 27, 2007 | publisher = MySQL Performance Blog | access-date = 2007-03-28}}</ref> Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), [[octal]], [[hexadecimal]], and [[Binary code|binary]] notations.\n\n[[Floating point]] numbers are also stored in a platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point notation, or two forms of [[scientific notation]].<ref name=\"types\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php|title=Types |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref> PHP has a native [[Boolean datatype|Boolean]] type that is similar to the native Boolean types in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]]. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in [[Perl]] and C++.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nThe null data type represents a variable that has no value; <code>NULL</code> is the only allowed value for this data type.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nVariables of the \"resource\" type represent references to resources from external sources. These are typically created by functions from a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from the same extension; examples include file, image, and database resources.<ref name=\"types\" />\n\nArrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can handle, including resources, objects, and even other arrays. Order is preserved in lists of values and in [[hash table|hashes]] with both keys and values, and the two can be intermingled.<ref name=\"types\" /> PHP also supports [[string (computing)|strings]], which can be used with single quotes, double quotes, nowdoc or [[heredoc]] syntax.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-21|url=https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php|title=Strings |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.php.net/spl | title = SPL&nbsp;\u2013 StandardPHPLibrary | date = March 16, 2009 | website = PHP.net | access-date = 2009-03-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Functions ===\nPHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many are also available in various extensions; these functions are well documented in the online PHP documentation.<ref name=\"functions\" /> However, the built-in library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated inconsistencies, as described under [[#History|history]] above.\n\nCustom functions may be defined by the developer:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction myAge(int $birthYear): string\n{\n    // calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.\n    $yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear;\n\n    // return the age in a descriptive string.\n    return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1 ? 's':'');\n}\n\necho 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object's properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [[wikt:replica|replica]] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/language.oop5.cloning|title=Object cloning |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a basic example of [[object-oriented programming]] in PHP:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\n<?php\n\nabstract class User\n{\n    public string $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function greet(): string\n    {\n        return \"Hello, my name is \" . $this->name;\n    }\n\n    abstract public function job(): string;\n}\n\nclass Student extends User\n{\n    public string $course;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string $course)\n    {\n        $this->course = $course;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I learn \" . $this->course;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Teacher extends User\n{\n    public array $teachingCourses;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string...$teachingCourses)\n    {\n        $this->teachingCourses = $teachingCourses;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I teach \" . implode(\", \", $this->teachingCourses);\n    }\n}\n\n$students = [\n    new Student(\"Alice\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Bob\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Charlie\", \"Business Studies\"),\n];\n$teachers = [\n    new Teacher(\"Dan\", \"Computer Science\", \"Information Security\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Erin\", \"Computer Science\", \"3D Graphics Programming\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Frankie\", \"Online Marketing\", \"Business Studies\", \"E-commerce\"),\n];\n\necho \"Students: \\n\";\nforeach ($students as $student) {\n    echo $student->greet() . \", \" . $student->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\necho \"Teachers: \\n\";\nforeach ($teachers as $teacher) {\n    echo $teacher->greet() . \", \" . $teacher->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Output of program:\n// Students:\n// Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\n// Teachers:\n// Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\n// Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\n// Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe [[visibility (computer science)|visibility]] of PHP properties and methods is defined using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only [[variable (programming)|var]] is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>. Items declared <code>public</code> can be accessed everywhere. <code>protected</code> limits access to [[inherited class]]es (and to the class that defines the item). <code>private</code> limits visibility only to the class that defines the item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theserverpages.com/php/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php |title= Visibility (PHP Manual) |website=theserverpages.com |date=2005-05-19 |access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, [[Zend Opcache]], is built into PHP since version 5.5.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = [VOTE] Integrating Zend Optimizer+ into the PHP distribution\n| url = http://news.php.net/php.internals/66531\n| access-date = 2013-03-08\n| website = news.php.net\n}}</ref> Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the [[Alternative PHP Cache]] (APC), which is available as a [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] extension.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\n| title = Alternative PHP Cache\n| access-date = 2013-09-21\n| website = PHP.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [[compiler]]s or support [[JIT compilation]], and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\n\n* [[HHVM]] (HipHop Virtual Machine)&nbsp;\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [[intermediate language]]), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [[Just-in-time compiler|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\u00d7 performance improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2813/we-are-the-98-5-and-the-16 |title=We are the 98.5% (and the 16%) \u00ab HipHop Virtual Machine |website=hhvm.com |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/|title=The Definitive PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 & 7.3 Benchmarks (2019)|date=2019-01-14|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226489/web-development/forget-php-facebooks-hhvm-engine-switches-to-hack-instead.html|title=Forget PHP!

PHP has a direct module interface called [[Server Application Programming Interface]] (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including [[Apache HTTP Server]], [[Microsoft Internet Information Server|Microsoft IIS]], [[Netscape]] (now defunct) and [[iPlanet]]. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the [[Internet Server Application Programming Interface]] (ISAPI), which is a [[Microsoft]]'s web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed.

Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although non-PHP text is still subject to [[control structure]]s described in PHP code. The most common delimiters are <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?php</syntaxhighlight> to open and <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline>?></syntaxhighlight> to close PHP sections. The shortened form <syntaxhighlight lang=\"PHP\" inline><?</syntaxhighlight> also exists.

However, before PHP&nbsp;7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer or string.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\nUnlike function and class names, variable names are case sensitive.

' old.';\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn {{CURRENTYEAR}}, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 1995}} years old.'\n\nIn lieu of [[function pointer]]s, functions in PHP can be referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal PHP functions can be used, for example, as [[Callback function|callbacks]] or within [[function table]]s.<ref name=\"variable-functions\" /> User-defined functions may be created at any time without being [[Function prototype|prototyped]].<ref name=\"functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php\n| title = User-defined functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref><ref name=\"variable-functions\">{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.variable-functions.php\n| title = Variable functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> Functions may be defined inside code blocks, permitting a [[dynamic dispatch|run-time decision]] as to whether or not a function should be defined. There is a <code>function_exists</code> function that determines whether a function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class [[constructor (computer science)|constructor]] functions called with the PHP operator <code>new</code>, in which case parentheses are optional.\n\nUntil PHP 5.3, support for [[anonymous functions]] and [[Closure (computer science)|closures]] did not exist in PHP. While <code>create_function()</code> has existed since PHP&nbsp;4.0.1, it is merely a thin wrapper around <code>eval()</code> that allows normal PHP functions to be created during program execution.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function.php\n| title = create_function() (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> PHP&nbsp;5.3 added syntax to define an anonymous function or \"closure\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php\n| title = Anonymous functions (PHP manual)\n| date = 2014-07-04 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> which can capture variables from the surrounding scope:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder($x)\n{\n    return function($y) use ($x) {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the example above, <code>getAdder()</code> function creates a closure using passed argument {{code|lang=php|code=$x}} (the keyword <code>use</code> imports a variable from the lexical context), which takes an additional argument {{code|lang=php|code=$y}}, and returns the created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a [[parameter (computer programming)|parameter]] to other functions, etc.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures\n| title = Request for Comments: Lambda functions and closures\n| date = 2008-07-01 | access-date = 2014-07-07\n| author1 = Christian Seiler | author2 = Dmitry Stogov\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nUnusually for a dynamically typed language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters, which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes and interfaces since PHP&nbsp;5.0, for arrays since PHP&nbsp;5.1, for \"callables\" since PHP&nbsp;5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and boolean) types since PHP&nbsp;7.0.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> PHP&nbsp;7.0 also has type declarations for function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the list of parameters, preceded by a colon.<ref name=\"return-types\" /> For example, the <code>getAdder</code> function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like so in PHP&nbsp;7:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\nfunction getAdder(int $x): Closure\n{\n    return function(int $y) use ($x): int\n    {\n        return $x + $y;\n    };\n}\n\n$adder = getAdder(8);\necho $adder(2); // prints \"10\"\necho $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type was passed\n$adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBy default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles. So, for example, if a parameter's type is <code>int</code>, PHP would allow not only integers, but also convertible numeric strings, floats or booleans to be passed to that function, and would convert them.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" /> However, PHP&nbsp;7 has a \"strict typing\" mode which, when used, disallows such conversions for function calls and returns within a file.<ref name=\"scalar-types\" />\n\n=== PHP Objects ===\nBasic [[object-oriented programming]] functionality was added in PHP&nbsp;3 and improved in PHP&nbsp;4.<ref name=\"about PHP\" /> This allowed for PHP to gain further abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP&nbsp;5, expanding the feature set and enhancing performance.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\" /> In previous versions of PHP, objects were handled like [[value type]]s.<ref name=\"php 5 objects\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/07/15/php-5-object-references/|title=PHP&nbsp;5 Object References |website=mjtsai.com}}</ref> The drawback of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's \"reference\" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are referenced by [[handle (computing)|handle]], and not by value.\n\nPHP 5 introduced private and protected [[member variable]]s and methods, along with [[abstract type|abstract classes]], [[final type|final classes]], [[abstract method]]s, and [[final method]]s. It also introduced a standard way of declaring [[constructor (computer science)|constructors]] and [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as [[C++]], and a standard [[exception handling]] model. Furthermore, PHP&nbsp;5 added [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. [[object (computer science)|Objects]] implementing ArrayAccess can be used with [[array data type|array]] syntax and objects implementing [[Iterator]] or [[IteratorAggregate]] can be used with the <code>foreach</code> [[language construct]]. There is no [[virtual table]] feature in the engine, so [[static variable]]s are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.<ref name=\"zend engine 2\">{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php|title=Classes and Objects (PHP&nbsp;5) |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nIf the developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word <code>clone</code>, the Zend engine will check whether a <code>__clone()</code> method has been defined. If not, it will call a default <code>__clone()</code> which will copy the object's properties. If a <code>__clone()</code> method is defined, then it will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer can start with a by-value [[wikt:replica|replica]] of the source object and only override properties that need to be changed.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2008-03-16|url=https://www.php.net/language.oop5.cloning|title=Object cloning |publisher=The PHP Group}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a basic example of [[object-oriented programming]] in PHP:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\" line=\"1\">\n<?php\n\nabstract class User\n{\n    public string $name;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name)\n    {\n        $this->name = $name;\n    }\n\n    public function greet(): string\n    {\n        return \"Hello, my name is \" . $this->name;\n    }\n\n    abstract public function job(): string;\n}\n\nclass Student extends User\n{\n    public string $course;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string $course)\n    {\n        $this->course = $course;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I learn \" . $this->course;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Teacher extends User\n{\n    public array $teachingCourses;\n\n    public function __construct(string $name, string...$teachingCourses)\n    {\n        $this->teachingCourses = $teachingCourses;\n        parent::__construct($name);\n    }\n\n    public function job(): string\n    {\n        return \"I teach \" . implode(\", \", $this->teachingCourses);\n    }\n}\n\n$students = [\n    new Student(\"Alice\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Bob\", \"Computer Science\"),\n    new Student(\"Charlie\", \"Business Studies\"),\n];\n$teachers = [\n    new Teacher(\"Dan\", \"Computer Science\", \"Information Security\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Erin\", \"Computer Science\", \"3D Graphics Programming\"),\n    new Teacher(\"Frankie\", \"Online Marketing\", \"Business Studies\", \"E-commerce\"),\n];\n\necho \"Students: \\n\";\nforeach ($students as $student) {\n    echo $student->greet() . \", \" . $student->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\necho \"Teachers: \\n\";\nforeach ($teachers as $teacher) {\n    echo $teacher->greet() . \", \" . $teacher->job() . \"\\n\";\n}\n\n// Output of program:\n// Students:\n// Hello, my name is Alice, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Bob, I learn Computer Science\n// Hello, my name is Charlie, I learn Business Studies\n// Teachers:\n// Hello, my name is Dan, I teach Computer Science, Information Security\n// Hello, my name is Erin, I teach Computer Science, 3D Graphics Programming\n// Hello, my name is Frankie, I teach Online Marketing, Business Studies, E-commerce\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe [[visibility (computer science)|visibility]] of PHP properties and methods is defined using the [[keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>. The default is public, if only [[variable (programming)|var]] is used; <code>var</code> is a synonym for <code>public</code>. Items declared <code>public</code> can be accessed everywhere. <code>protected</code> limits access to [[inherited class]]es (and to the class that defines the item). <code>private</code> limits visibility only to the class that defines the item.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theserverpages.com/php/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php |title= Visibility (PHP Manual) |website=theserverpages.com |date=2005-05-19 |access-date=2010-08-26}}</ref> Objects of the same type have access to each other's private and protected members even though they are not the same instance.\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe only complete PHP implementation is the original, known simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by the [[Zend Engine]]. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially called \"Zend PHP\". The Zend Engine [[Compiler|compiles]] PHP [[source code]] on-the-fly into an internal format that it can execute, thus it works as an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-11-04|url=http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Howto&pagename=Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/languages.html|title=How do computer languages work?}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beginning PHP and MySQL 5: From Novice to Professional |author=Gilmore, W.

Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.\n\nPHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and the fact the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various products have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's internal format by using an [[opcode]] cache, which works by [[Cache (computing)|caching]] the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]] to avoid the overhead of [[parsing]] and [[compiling]] the code every time the script runs. An opcode cache, [[Zend Opcache]], is built into PHP since version 5.5.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = [VOTE] Integrating Zend Optimizer+ into the PHP distribution\n| url = http://news.php.net/php.internals/66531\n| access-date = 2013-03-08\n| website = news.php.net\n}}</ref> Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the [[Alternative PHP Cache]] (APC), which is available as a [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] extension.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\n| title = Alternative PHP Cache\n| access-date = 2013-09-21\n| website = PHP.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile Zend PHP is still the most popular implementation, several other implementations have been developed. Some of these are [[compiler]]s or support [[JIT compilation]], and hence offer performance benefits over Zend PHP at the expense of lacking full PHP compatibility. Alternative implementations include the following:\n\n* [[HHVM]] (HipHop Virtual Machine)&nbsp;\u2013 developed at Facebook and available as open source, it converts PHP code into a high-level bytecode (commonly known as an [[intermediate language]]), which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically at runtime by a [[Just-in-time compiler|just-in-time]] (JIT) compiler, resulting in up to 6\u00d7 performance improvements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2813/we-are-the-98-5-and-the-16 |title=We are the 98.5% (and the 16%) \u00ab HipHop Virtual Machine |website=hhvm.com |date=December 2013 |access-date=2014-02-23}}</ref> However, since version 7.2 Zend has outperformed HHVM,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinsta.com/blog/php-benchmarks/|title=The Definitive PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 & 7.3 Benchmarks (2019)|date=2019-01-14|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> and HHVM 3.24 is the last version to officially support PHP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226489/web-development/forget-php-facebooks-hhvm-engine-switches-to-hack-instead.html|title=Forget PHP!

If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) or [[FastCGI]] processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.<ref name=\"installation\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.general.php\n| title = General Installation Considerations\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-2\n| title = News Archive: PHP&nbsp;5.3.3 Released!\n| date = 2010-07-22\n| website = php.net}}</ref> When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php\n| title = FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP [[command-line interface]] (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI [[server application programming interface]] (SAPI) as of PHP&nbsp;4.3.0.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.introduction.php\n| title = Command line usage: Introduction\n| access-date = 2013-09-22\n| website = php.net\n}}</ref> The main focus of this SAPI is developing [[command line interface|shell]] applications using PHP.

This form is what is known as a SAPI.\n\nThere are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI) and [[command-line interface]] (CLI).<ref name=\"php-installation2\" /><ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.introduction.php|title = Command line usage: Introduction|access-date = 2013-09-22|website = php.net}}</ref>\n\nPHP can also be used for writing desktop [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) applications, by using the [[PHP-GTK]] extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution,<ref name=\"installation\" /> and as an extension it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer.

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

According to Winter, the story emerged because the characters are so similar, and even he and Reeves sometimes became confused about who was who.<ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/bill-ted-25th-anniversary-trivia/|title=Bill & Ted at 25: Dude, Bet You Didn\u2019t Know These 7 Gnarly Facts|last=Watercutter|first=Angela|date=17 February 2014|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=1 June 2016|location=San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nThrough rehearsals, Winter and Reeves worked on developing their Bill & Ted characters to move them away from being stereotypical comedic slackers and insert sincerity and other more human elements into them.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> While they developed mannerisms outside of the script, influenced partially by British comedians like [[Peter Sellers]] and [[Spike Milligan]], the pair kept to the dialog written by Solomon and Mathseon, with Winter calling it \"very floral, so paradoxical to how you think dumb Valley guys would speak\".<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Winter said that to develop Bill's character, he borrowed from the looks and trends along [[Venice Beach]], California, where he had been living, including wearing a baseball cap backwards and pulling part of his hair through that opening.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/>\n\nWinter said of casting [[George Carlin]] as Rufus as a \"very happy accident\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/|title=Hey, Alex Winter here from Bill & Ted and Downloaded and noticed a lot of child stars memes today.

Herek stated that their intention was to have [[Eddie Van Halen]] as Rufus, given the frequency of [[Van Halen]] references in the screenplay, but this was not possible because of the low budget for the film. They started looking at other actors who would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1989 film directed by Stephen Herek}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\n| image = Bill & Ted.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Theatrical release poster\n| director = [[Stephen Herek]]\n| producers = {{Plainlist|\n* Scott Kroopf\n* Michael S.

A third film, ''[[Bill & Ted Face the Music]]'' is in development and is scheduled to be released in August 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1988 [[San Dimas, California]], [[slacker]]s Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted (Theodore) Logan would rather pursue their band the Wyld Stallyns (Although they're rather inept at guitar and aren't even truly interested in learning to play better) than schoolwork. Bill and Ted are failing history, and they need an A+ on their history report if they want to pass the class. Ted's father, the local police captain, threatens to send Ted to military school in Alaska if they should flunk their history class (and school along with it), ruining their dreams of success. The two struggle to assemble a final report for the class, which is to describe how three historical figures would see modern-day San Dimas.\n\nSeven hundred years from then, in 2688, humanity has built a [[utopia]], thanks to the music of Wyld Stallyns. The supreme beings of this world instruct Rufus (Carlin) to travel back in time by a [[time travel|time machine]] disguised as a [[phone booth]], to help Bill and Ted pass their class. Rufus lands by the two as they work on their report near a [[Circle K]]. As he introduces himself, a second phone booth lands nearby, and future versions of Bill and Ted come out, proving their identity to their younger selves, and telling them to trust Rufus before they leave. Rufus offers to show the teens how the machine works, taking them to [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1805, where [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] is commanding the [[French Revolutionary Army|French Army]]. Assured the machine works, Rufus, Bill and Ted return to the present, though Napoleon, knocked back by an explosion, is caught in the phone booth's wake and dragged with them. Back at Ted's house, Rufus provides the teens additional instructions and then leaves before another identical phone booth time machine shows up. The two find Napoleon, passed out nearby, and come upon an idea of taking historical figures from the past to bring them to the present to complete their report. They leave Napoleon with Ted's younger brother Deacon, and set out. Before they go, Ted's father chews him out for failing history, losing his keys and not focusing on his schoolwork and grounds him until Ted ships out to military school the following night. Bill calls from the phone booth passing himself off as a new deputy, and instructing him to come the station to retrieve his lost keys, allowing Ted to escape, so they can work on their report. \n\nSeparately, they gain the trust of [[Billy the Kid]] from 1879, and [[Socrates]] from 410 BC, and bring them along. They next land in 15th century medieval England, and see two princesses, who flirt with them. Bill and Ted attempt help them escape, because their father has arranged marriage for both of them to \"two fat horrible old men\", but are caught by their father, the local king (whose entourage they refer to as 'royal ugly dudes'), and ordered to be beheaded. They are rescued at the last minute by Billy and Socrates, but in their escape, the phone booth's antenna is damaged by a knight's mace, and the booth starts running out of control. After a brief landing in the utopian society of 2688, Bill and Ted initially take advantage of it by obtaining more historical figures for extra credit, including [[Sigmund Freud]] from Vienna, Austria in 1901; [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] from Kassel, Germany in 1810; [[Joan of Arc]] from Orleans, France in 1429; [[Genghis Khan]] from Outer Mongolia in 1209; and [[Abraham Lincoln]] from Washington, DC in 1863. With no more space in the booth, they finally see the broken antenna, and have to make a pit-stop in prehistoric times to make repairs. After a crude repair with chewing gum and pudding cups, Bill and Ted regain control of the booth, but they end up at the Circle K, witnessing their past selves on the night before the report. They repeat their advice to them about Rufus, and then ask Rufus how to get to their present time; Rufus also alerts them that time is running short.\n\nBack in their current timeframe, with two hours before the report presentation, Bill and Ted leave the historical figures at the local mall to experience San Dimas, while they try to track down Napoleon, whom Deacon had ditched the previous night after an embarrassing night out. They find Napoleon at the Waterloo water park, but by the time they return to the mall, the historical figures have caused a commotion, and are now in jail under Ted's father's watch, and he refuses to set them free. They develop a plan to use the time machine after the presentation as to plant elements via [[Causal loop|predestination paradoxes]] to help free the historical figures (finally explaining the disappearance of Ted's father's lost keys), and make their way to the school, barely arriving in time for their presentation. With the help of the historical figures, the two give an impressive presentation that ensures they pass the course.\n\nAfter returning the historical figures and successfully getting an A+ on their history report, Bill and Ted return to practice, and having matured somewhat along the journey, they decide maybe they should actually take time to learn to play better, when Rufus shows up with the two princesses in tow, having rescued them himself since he knows they will be their wives and bandmates in the future. As the band starts to play, terribly, Rufus [[Fourth wall|explains to the audience]], \"They do get better.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400|align=right\n|image1=Keanu_Reeves_Fantastic_Fest_2014.jpg\n|image2=Alex_winter_2013.jpg\n|image3=George carlin headshot 2008.jpg\n|footer=Keanu Reeves (left), Alex Winter, and George Carlin}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Ted \u2018\u2019Theodore\u2019\u2019 Logan\n* [[Alex Winter]] as Bill S.

They started looking at other actors who would fit the rock motif, making a short list that had included [[Ringo Starr]], [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> They soon recognized that no one on this list was a comedian. Producers [[Scott Kroopf]] and Bob Cort had just finished filming ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' which co-starred [[George Carlin]], and with the film's production nearly complete, were able to get him to complete filming.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe Three Most Important People in the utopian society were envisioned to be portrayed by the band members of [[ZZ Top]]. However, Solomon had connections to the [[E Street Band]], [[The Tubes]] and [[The Motels]], and were able to get [[Clarence Clemons]], [[Fee Waybill]], and [[Martha Davis (musician)|Martha Davis]], respectively, for the Most Important People.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe film's writers, Solomon and Matheson, appear in the film's ice cream scene as the \"stupid\" and \"ugly\" waiters, respectively.

Coronado's auditorium was torn down during 2005-07 renovations, but its unique roof and intricate exterior mosaic, seen in an opening scene when Bill and Ted leave school in a red Mustang, was saved and moved, piece by piece, to the new auditorium. The interior shots of the auditorium were filmed inside the [[East High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|East High School]] auditorium, which was in Phoenix on 48th Street just north of Van Buren. East High School was demolished in 2002 as part of a redevelopment project.  The production also shot a sequence on the Western Street on the back lot of Southwestern Studio in [[Carefree, Arizona]].\n\nThe scenes at Waterloo are a combination of [[establishing shot]]s at [[Raging Waters]] in San Dimas and shots with the actors at [[Golfland Sunsplash]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]]. Because of the limited budget, they could not close down the waterparks for filming, and thus, all those in the background of these shots were paying customers to the waterparks on those days.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> The bowling alley was a Fair Lanes-branded alley at that time but is now the [[AMF Bowling Center|AMF]] Tempe Village Lanes on Rural Road at [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]], three miles south of [[Arizona State University]]. The mall was Phoenix [[Metrocenter Mall (Phoenix, Arizona)|Metrocenter]], between Peoria and Dunlap Avenues at [[Interstate 17]].

Winter called the experience of filming these booths difficult as to come up with the practical effects of filming the booth with multiple people standing inside it on a [[gimble]] in front of a [[green screen]] with numerous equipment and prop failures; Reeves called it \"a death ride canoe from the worst carny ride you\u2019ve ever been on\".<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\n===Post-production===\nInitially, the film had ended with Bill & Ted giving their report within a small classroom, passing their class, and then going to the prom with the rescued princesses. The production team recognized this felt underwhelming, and created the larger auditorium presentation as to give a better sense of scale, with a sound and light show to make it more dramatic setting.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/>\n\nThe initial cut of the film was 2 hours and 25 minutes long, and was pruned significantly. One such filmed scene was a lengthy choreographed song number that would have led off the film, starting with Bill & Ted dancing via air-guitaring on their way to school and ended up getting bullied by jocks once they arrived.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> Winter had found some stills from the filmed version of the scene on an old hard drive in February 2020 and shared them on the Internet and provided additional details on its production. Winter believed that [[Kenny Ortega]] had been involved in establishing the choreography based on the time period and his recollection. Winter said neither he nor Reeves could dance prior to shooting this scene, so the scene was rehearsed for roughly an hour a day across several weeks concurrent to other parts of filming.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/alex-winter-bill-ted-excellent-adventure-lost-scene-interview-955329/ | title = Alex Winter Breaks Down Lost \u2018Bill and Ted\u2019 Dance Sequence, 30 Years Later | first= Krow | last = Grow | date = February 20, 2020 | accessdate = February 23, 2020 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> Winter identified other scenes that he recalled filming that had been cut, including a scene involving a prom, and a running gag involving the pudding cups and the \"John the Serf\" character that remained in the films credits.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/> While they had tried to find the film reels with this cut footage, Winter said that with the fate of DEG following film, it is likely lost.<ref name=\"rs cut intro\"/>\n\nThe picture had been planned for a 1988 release, and filming and production had completed on schedule.

Henek said many of these companies were confused, asking him \"Are there kids that really speak like this?\" on seeing the film. However, the cut had an extremely popular reaction from a test audience of volunteers pulled from local malls, which led to a small bidding war from production companies to get the title.<ref name=\"guardian dev\"/> Some of the former DEG executives ended up at [[Nelson Entertainment]], and along with [[Orion Pictures]], were able to secure new distribution rights for the film by 1988 for about {{USD|1 million}}.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/><ref name=\"Wired 17 February 2014\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Bill & Ted'' had its theatrical release on February 17, 1989.<ref name=\"thr breakdown\"/> It was followed in 1991 by a [[sequel]], ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1989\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam rock]], [[glam metal]], [[pop rock]], [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]]\n| length     = 40:32\n| label      = A&M Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe film's soundtrack was released in 1989.

[...] Moreover, there had already been plenty of films about time-travelling teens by the time ''Bill & Ted'' rocked up in cinemas, such as ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Few who were around then would have bet that a goofy movie about a pair of California metalheads skipping back through time in a phonebox collecting historical characters to bring back to 20th-century California for their history report would still be remembered today. But I am very much among those few\".<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 April 2014\"/>\n\nThe film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Bill/Ted: \"Excellent!\" \u2013 Nominated<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/quotes400.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==In cultural analysis==\nWriting in British Sunday newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Tom Holland (author)|Tom Holland]] noted, <blockquote>''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'' does not tend to be rated as one of cinema's profounder treatments of the relationship between present and past. The story of two Californian slackers with a time machine who, for complicated reasons, have to assemble assorted celebrities from history in order to pass a high-school project, it is chiefly remembered for bringing Keanu Reeves to the attention of a mass audience. Classicists, however, will always cherish it as the only film ever to combine the music of Van Halen with Greek philosophy. When Bill and Ted embark on their quest, what should be their first destination if not classical Athens, and who should be the very first 'historical dude' bundled into their time machine if not a bald-headed man in a sheet whom they persist in calling 'Soh-kraytz'?\"<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\">{{cite news |last= Holland |first= Tom | authorlink= Tom Holland (author)| title= The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life by Bettany Hughes \u2013 review |url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/24/hemlock-cup-bettany-hughes-review| date= 24 October 2010|newspaper= [[The Observer]] |location=London| accessdate= 29 May 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHolland continued: \n<blockquote>Even to metalheads, then, the philosophy of ancient Greece serves as something that is both primal and emblematic of civilisation as a whole. Socrates, in particular, the 'lover of wisdom' who insisted that the most fundamental presumptions of his countrymen should be subjected to experimental investigation, and who ended up being made to drink hemlock for his pains, has always been admired as the very fountainhead of rationalism. Yet when it comes to identifying what he taught and believed, there is a problem, on which ''Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure'', rather unexpectedly, puts its finger. Socrates, transplanted to 1980s California, can only communicate with his abductors by gesturing and gurning \u2013 since Bill and Ted, it goes without saying, speak not a word of ancient Greek. Even the miracle of time travel, it appears, cannot serve to alter what is, for any historian, a most awkward fact: that it is impossible to be certain of what Socrates actually said.<ref name=\"The Observer 24 October 2010\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe film was mentioned as an example of pop-culture time travel in the 2019 blockbuster film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Film|United States|Comedy|1980s}}\n*[[Deus ex machina]]\n*[[Novikov self-consistency principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0096928}}\n* {{IMDb title|0098752}} (animated TV series)\n* {{IMDb title|0103365}} (TV series)\n* {{Amg title|5541}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure}}\n\n{{Bill and Ted}}\n{{Stephen Herek}}\n\n[[Category:1989 films]]\n[[Category:1980s adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:1980s independent films]]\n[[Category:1980s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American adventure comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction adventure films]]\n[[Category:American space adventure films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:Bill & Ted]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Billy the Kid]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Socrates]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Genghis Khan on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Napoleon on film]]\n[[Category:Depictions of Ludwig van Beethoven on film]]\n[[Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film]]\n[[Category:Films about time travel]]\n[[Category:Films about Joan of Arc]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Stephen Herek]]\n[[Category:Films scored by David Newman]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1st century BC]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 13th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1420s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1805]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1860s]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1879]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1901]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1988]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 27th century]]\n[[Category:Films set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Films set in amusement parks]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Italy]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Interscope Communications films]]\n[[Category:Orion Pictures films]]\n[[Category:San Dimas, California]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n", "name_user": "Davidnicholsknowsbest", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSoundtrack", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure"}

It was about {{convert|6.5|m|ft|1}} long and {{convert|465|kg|lb}} in weight, making it one of the largest theropods of its time. Individuals of this species may have grown even larger, because the only known specimen probably represents a sub-adult. ''Cryolophosaurus'' is known from a skull, a femur and other material, the skull and femur of which have caused its classification to vary greatly. The femur possesses many primitive characteristics that have classified ''Cryolophosaurus'' as a [[Dilophosauridae|dilophosaurid]] or a neotheropod outside of Dilophosauridae and Averostra, where as the skull has many advanced features, leading the genus to be considered a tetanuran, an abelisaurid, a ceratosaur and even an allosaurid. Since its original description, the consensus is that ''Cryolophosaurus'' is either a primitive member of the [[Tetanurae]] or a close relative of that group.\n\n''Cryolophosaurus'' possessed a distinctive \"[[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]]\" crest that spanned the head from side to side. Based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture, it is thought that this bizarre crest was used for [[intra-species recognition]]. The [[brain]] of ''Cryolophosaurus'' was also more primitive than those of other theropods.\n\n''Cryolophosaurus'' was first excavated from Antarctica's Early Jurassic, [[Sinemurian]] to [[Pliensbachian]] aged [[Hanson Formation]], formerly the upper Falla Formation, by [[paleontologist]] [[William R. Hammer|Dr. William Hammer]] in 1991. It was the first [[carnivore|carnivorous]] dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic [[Period (geology)|Period]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Cryolophosaurus reconstruction (flipped).jpg|left|thumb|''Cryolophosaurus'' [[Paleoart|restored]] with scales]]\nThe [[holotype]] FMNH PR1821 is the only fully described specimen of ''Cryolophosaurus''.

The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later species of the [[clade]] [[Tetanurae]], like China's ''[[Sinraptor]]'' and ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]''. This led [[Paul Sereno]] ''et al.'' (1994) to place ''Cryolophosaurus'' in the taxon Allosauridae.<ref name=sereno1994/> Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that ''Cryolophosaurus'' might be a [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaur]] or even an early [[Abelisauria|abelisaur]], with some traits [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/> While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered ''Cryolophosaurus'' as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors found that it was more closely related to ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Dracovenator]]''.<ref name=\"smithetal2005\"/><ref name=\"smithetal2007\"/> [[Sterling Nesbitt]] ''et al.''

The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]], and his team. The fossils were found in the [[siliceous]] [[siltstone]] of the [[Hanson Formation]], formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the [[Pliensbachian Stage]] of the early [[Jurassic]]. ''Cryolophosaurus'' was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after ''[[Antarctopelta]]'', but named earlier.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/>\n[[File:Cryolophosaurus.jpg|alt=|thumb|Skeletal mount in front view]]\nIn 1991, both Hammer and the [[Ohio State University]] geologist [[David Elliot (geologist)|David Elliot]] excavated separate outcroppings near Beardmore Glacier, sharing logistical expenses. Elliot's team first came across the remains of ''Cryolophosaurus'' in a rock formation around the altitude of {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} high and about {{convert|640|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the South Pole. When the discovery was made, they soon notified Hammer. Over the next three weeks, Hammer excavated {{convert|2300|kg|abbr=on}} of fossil-bearing rock. The team recovered over 100 fossil bones, including those of ''Cryolophosaurus''.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/> The specimens were formally named and described in 1994 by Hammer and Hickerson, in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/>\n\nDuring the 2003 season, a field team returned and collected more material from the original site. A second locality was discovered about {{convert|30|m|ft}} higher in the section on Mt. Kirkpatrick.<ref name=leslie/>\n\nThe name ''Cryolophosaurus ellioti'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'cold' or 'frozen', in reference to its discovery in Antarctica), \u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'crest') and \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'lizard'), thus \"cold crest lizard\".

(2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian ''et al.'' noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures can be explained by the phenomenon of [[intra-species recognition]], which is supported by the fossil evidence.<ref name=glut2006/><ref name=padian/> [[Thomas R. Holtz Jr.]] (2010) found that the bizarre crest of ''Cryolophosaurus'' was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture.<ref name=\"Holtz2012\"/> According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.<ref name=\"rich-gang-ham_1997\"/> In 2019, a species recognition function was disputed but a socio-sexual display structure model was suggested.<ref name=\"Yun2019\"/>\n\n===Diet===\nWhen the type specimen was discovered, several long cervical ribs, of a supposed prosauropod dinosaur were found in the mouth of ''Cryolophosaurus'', which led Hammer (1998) to conclude that it was feeding on the prosauropod when it died. Hammer further noted that since the ribs were found extending all the way back to the theropod's neck region, this individual may have choked to death on these ribs.<ref name=\"hammer1998\"/> However, Smith ''et al.'' concluded that these remains belonged to the ''Cryolophosaurus'' specimen itself, and not to Hammer's \"prosauropod\".<ref name=\"smithetal2007\"/> Hammer also concluded that a post-canine tooth belonging to a [[tritylodont]] (an early mammal relative), found with the remains, was part of its stomach contents when it died.<ref name=glut1999/>\n\n===Paleopathology===\n[[File:Juvenile Cryolophosaurus Teeth.jpg|thumb|Juvenile ''Cryolophosaurus'' teeth|alt=|left]]\nSome ''Cryolophosaurus'' bones have pathologies that show evidence of scavenging.

It was about {{convert|6.5|m|ft|1}} long and {{convert|465|kg|lb}} in weight, making it one of the largest theropods of its time. Individuals of this species may have grown even larger, because the only known specimen probably represents a sub-adult. ''Cryolophosaurus'' is known from a skull, a femur and other material, the skull and femur of which have caused its classification to vary greatly. The femur possesses many primitive characteristics that have classified ''Cryolophosaurus'' as a [[Dilophosauridae|dilophosaurid]] or a neotheropod outside of Dilophosauridae and Averostra, where as the skull has many advanced features, leading the genus to be considered a tetanuran, an abelisaurid, a ceratosaur and even an allosaurid. Since its original description, the consensus is that ''Cryolophosaurus'' is either a primitive member of the [[Tetanurae]] or a close relative of that group.\n\n''Cryolophosaurus'' possessed a distinctive \"[[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]]\" crest that spanned the head from side to side. Based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture, it is thought that this bizarre crest was used for [[intra-species recognition]]. The [[brain]] of ''Cryolophosaurus'' was also more primitive than those of other theropods.\n\n''Cryolophosaurus'' was first excavated from Antarctica's Early Jurassic, [[Sinemurian]] to [[Pliensbachian]] aged [[Hanson Formation]], formerly the upper Falla Formation, by [[paleontologist]] [[William R. Hammer|Dr. William Hammer]] in 1991. It was the first [[carnivore|carnivorous]] dinosaur to be discovered in Antarctica and the first non-avian dinosaur from the continent to be officially named. The sediments in which its fossils were found have been dated at ~194 to 188 million years ago, representing the Early Jurassic [[Period (geology)|Period]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Cryolophosaurus reconstruction (flipped).jpg|left|thumb|''Cryolophosaurus'' [[Paleoart|restored]] with scales]]\nThe [[holotype]] FMNH PR1821 is the only fully described specimen of ''Cryolophosaurus''.

The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later species of the [[clade]] [[Tetanurae]], like China's ''[[Sinraptor]]'' and ''[[Yangchuanosaurus]]''. This led [[Paul Sereno]] ''et al.'' (1994) to place ''Cryolophosaurus'' in the taxon Allosauridae.<ref name=sereno1994/> Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that ''Cryolophosaurus'' might be a [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaur]] or even an early [[Abelisauria|abelisaur]], with some traits [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/> While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered ''Cryolophosaurus'' as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors found that it was more closely related to ''[[Dilophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Dracovenator]]''.<ref name=\"smithetal2005\"/><ref name=\"smithetal2007\"/> [[Sterling Nesbitt]] ''et al.''

The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]], and his team. The fossils were found in the [[siliceous]] [[siltstone]] of the [[Hanson Formation]], formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the [[Pliensbachian Stage|Pliensbachian stage]] of the early [[Jurassic]]. ''Cryolophosaurus'' was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after ''[[Antarctopelta]]'', but named earlier.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/>\n[[File:Cryolophosaurus.jpg|alt=|thumb|Skeletal mount in front view]]\nIn 1991, both Hammer and the [[Ohio State University]] geologist [[David Elliot (geologist)|David Elliot]] excavated separate outcroppings near Beardmore Glacier, sharing logistical expenses. Elliot's team first came across the remains of ''Cryolophosaurus'' in a rock formation around the altitude of {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} high and about {{convert|640|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the South Pole. When the discovery was made, they soon notified Hammer. Over the next three weeks, Hammer excavated {{convert|2300|kg|abbr=on}} of fossil-bearing rock. The team recovered over 100 fossil bones, including those of ''Cryolophosaurus''.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/> The specimens were formally named and described in 1994 by Hammer and Hickerson, in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"hammer&hickerson1994\"/>\n\nDuring the 2003 season, a field team returned and collected more material from the original site. A second locality was discovered about {{convert|30|m|ft}} higher in the section on Mt. Kirkpatrick.<ref name=leslie/>\n\nThe name ''Cryolophosaurus ellioti'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words \u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'cold' or 'frozen', in reference to its discovery in Antarctica), \u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'crest') and \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (meaning 'lizard'), thus \"cold crest lizard\".

(2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian ''et al.'' noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures can be explained by the phenomenon of [[intra-species recognition]], which is supported by the fossil evidence.<ref name=glut2006/><ref name=padian/> [[Thomas R. Holtz Jr.]] (2010) found that the bizarre crest of ''Cryolophosaurus'' was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture.<ref name=\"Holtz2012\"/> According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.<ref name=\"rich-gang-ham_1997\"/> In 2019, a species recognition function was disputed but a socio-sexual display structure model was suggested.<ref name=\"Yun2019\"/>\n\n===Diet===\nWhen the type specimen was discovered, several long cervical ribs, of a supposed prosauropod dinosaur were found in the mouth of ''Cryolophosaurus'', which led Hammer (1998) to conclude that it was feeding on the prosauropod when it died. Hammer further noted that since the ribs were found extending all the way back to the theropod's neck region, this individual may have choked to death on these ribs.<ref name=\"hammer1998\"/> However, Smith ''et al.'' concluded that these remains belonged to the ''Cryolophosaurus'' specimen itself, and not to Hammer's \"prosauropod\".<ref name=\"smithetal2007\"/> Hammer also concluded that a post-canine tooth belonging to a [[tritylodont]] (an early mammal relative), found with the remains, was part of its stomach contents when it died.<ref name=glut1999/>\n\n===Paleopathology===\n[[File:Juvenile Cryolophosaurus Teeth.jpg|thumb|Juvenile ''Cryolophosaurus'' teeth|alt=|left]]\nSome ''Cryolophosaurus'' bones have pathologies that show evidence of scavenging.

The person writing the cheque, known as the ''[[Payor|drawer]]'', has a [[transactional account|transaction banking account]] (often called a current, cheque, chequing or checking account) where their money is held. The drawer writes the various details including the [[monetary]] amount, date, and a [[payee]] on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the ''drawee'', to pay that person or company the amount of money stated.\n\nDefinition of a cheque as per The National Provincial Bank circa 1968 was \u2018an unconditional order in writing drawn on a Banker, signed by the drawer, instructing the Banker to pay on demand a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to Bearer and which does not order any act to be done in addition to the payment of money\u2019.\n\nCheques are a type of [[Negotiable instrument#Bill of exchange|bill of exchange]] that were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money. [[Banknote|Paper money]] evolved from [[promissory note]]s, another form of negotiable instrument similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession (the \"[[Bearer instrument|bearer]]\").\n\nA cheque is a [[negotiable instrument]] instructing a [[financial institution]] to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified [[transactional account]] held in the drawer's name with that institution. Both the drawer and payee may be [[natural person]]s or [[Juristic person|legal entities]]. Cheques are ''order instruments'', and are not in general payable simply to the bearer as [[bearer instrument]]s are, but must be paid to the payee. In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid.\n\nAlthough forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular non-[[cash]] method for making [[payment]]s and the usage of cheques peaked. By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/resources_publications/key_facts_and_figures/cheques_and_bankers'_drafts_facts_and_figures/ |title=Cheques and Bankers' Drafts Facts and Figures |work=UK Payment Administration |publisher=UKPA |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613101220/http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/resources_publications/key_facts_and_figures/cheques_and_bankers%27_drafts_facts_and_figures/ |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since then cheque usage has fallen, being partly replaced by electronic payment systems.

Such an order was referred to as a ''[[Negotiable instrument#Bill of exchange|bill of exchange]]''. The use of bills of exchange facilitated trade by eliminating the need for merchants to carry large quantities of currency (for example, gold) to purchase goods and services.\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThere is early evidence of using cheques. In India, during the [[Maurya Empire]] (from 321 to 185 BC), a commercial instrument called the adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=155 | title=Reserve Bank of India - Publications}}</ref>\n\nThe ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as ''praescriptiones'' in the 1st century BCE.<ref name=\"Durant\">{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=    Caesar and Christ : a history of Roman civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to A.D. 325|series=The story of civilization|volume=3|year=1944|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|page=749}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the third century CE, banks in [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] territory began to issue letters of credit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Safari|first1=Meysam|title=Contractual structures and payoff patterns of Suk\u016bk securities|journal=International Journal of Banking and Finance|year=2013|volume=10|issue=2|quote= During the 3rd century AD, financial firms in Persia (currently known as Iran) and other territories in the Persian Sassanid Dynasty  issued  letters  of  credit  known  as  \u201cchak\u201d|ssrn=2386365}}</ref> These letters were termed ''\u010dak'', meaning \"document\" or \"contract\".<ref>Ilya Yakubovich.

These cashiers held the money for a fee. Competition drove cashiers to offer additional services including paying money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so. They kept the note as proof of payment.

Initially they were called ''drawn notes'', because they enabled a customer to draw on the funds that he or she had in the account with a bank and required immediate payment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/files/candc/history_publication_final_-_small_version.pdf |title=Cheques and cheque clearing: An historical perspective |year=2009 |author=Cheque and Credit Clearing Company |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These were handwritten, and one of the earliest known still to be in existence was drawn on Messrs Morris and Clayton, [[scrivener]]s and bankers based in the [[City of London]], and dated 16 February 1659.\n\nIn 1717, the [[Bank of England]] pioneered the first use of a pre-printed form. These forms were printed on \"cheque paper\" to prevent fraud, and customers had to attend in person and obtain a numbered form from the cashier. Once written, the cheque was brought back to the bank for settlement. The suppression of banknotes in eighteenth-century England further promoted the use of cheques.<ref>[http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/er08no4_QuinnRoberds.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ''The Evolution of the cheque as a Means of Payment: A Historical Survey'', 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019001522/http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/er08no4_QuinnRoberds.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nUntil about 1770, an informal exchange of cheques took place between London banks. Clerks of each bank visited all the other banks to exchange cheques, whilst keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other. Daily [[cheque clearing]] began around 1770 when the bank clerks met at the Five Bells, a tavern in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] in the City of London, to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash. This was the first [[bankers' clearing house]].\n\nProvincial clearing houses were established in major cities throughout the UK to facilitate the clearing of cheques on banks in the same town. Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton all had their own clearing houses.<ref>[https://www.archive.barclays.com/items/show/5421 ''History of Cheques - Barclays'', 2020]</ref>\n\nIn America, the Bank of New York, after its establishment by Alexander Hamilton in 1784, began issuing cheques.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofbankofn00dome#page/48/mode/2up |title=Domett, Henry Williams.

In 1830 the [[Bank of England]] introduced books of 50, 100, and 200 forms and counterparts, bound or stitched. These ''cheque books'' became a common format for the distribution of cheques to bank customers.\n\nIn the late 19th century, several countries formalized laws regarding cheques. The UK passed the [[Bills of Exchange Act 1882]], and India passed the [[Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]];<ref name=\"rbi.org.in\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=155 | title=Evolution of Payment Systems in India =Reserve Bank of India}}</ref> which both covered cheques.\n\n[[File:English 1956 Westminster Bank cheque of Doris Ogilvie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An English cheque from 1956 having a bank clerk's red mark verifying the signature, a two-pence stamp duty, and holes punched by hand to cancel it. This is a \"crossed cheque\" disallowing transfer of payment to another account.]]\n\nIn 1931 an attempt was made to simplify the international use of cheques by the [[Geneva Convention on the Unification of the Law Relating to Cheques]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.sg.report.itl.development.1966/1.html|title=1 - Progressive Development of the Law of International Trade: Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 1966|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015|year=1966}}</ref> Many European and South American states as well as Japan joined the convention. However, countries including the US and members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] did not participate and so it remained very difficult for cheques to be used across country borders.\n\nIn 1959 a standard for machine-readable characters ([[MICR]]) was agreed and patented in the US for use with cheques. This opened the way for the first automated reader/sorting machines for clearing cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change in the way in which cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-[[cash]] method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined.\n\nIn 1969 [[cheque guarantee card]]s were introduced in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honoured when used at a [[point of sale]]. The drawer would sign the cheque in front of the retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number on the back of the cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by [[debit cards]], starting in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s, many countries enacted laws to allow for [[cheque truncation]], in which a physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or clearing-house. This eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs.\n\nIn 2002, the [[Eurocheque]] system was phased out and replaced with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. <!-- Some European countries phased out the use of cheques altogether when the [[Eurocheque]] system, which they had used as their domestic cheque-clearing system, ceased on 1 January 2002. --> At that time, a number of countries took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.\n\n== Parts of a cheque ==\n[[File:BritishChequeAnnotated.png|frame|Parts of a cheque based on a UK example\n{{ordered list\n| drawee, the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment\n| payee\n| date of issue\n| amount of currency\n| drawer, the person or entity making the cheque\n| signature of drawer\n| Machine readable routing and account information\n}}]]\n\nThe four main items on a cheque are\n* ''Drawer'', the person or entity who makes the cheque\n* ''Payee'', the recipient of the money\n* ''Drawee'', the bank or other financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment\n* ''Amount'', the currency amount\n\nAs cheque usage increased during the 19th and 20th centuries, additional items were added to increase security or to make processing easier for the bank or financial institution. A signature of the drawer was required to authorize the cheque, and this is the main way to authenticate the cheque. Second, it became customary to write the amount in words as well as in numbers to avoid mistakes and make it harder to fraudulently alter the amount after the cheque had been written. It is not a legal requirement to write down the amount in words, although some banks will refuse to accept cheques that do not have the amount in both numbers and words.\n\nAn issue date was added, and cheques may not be valid a certain amount of time after issue.

Conversely, an [[antedated check|antedated cheque]] has an issue date in the past.\n\nA cheque number was added and cheque books were issued so that cheque numbers were sequential. This allowed for some basic fraud detection by banks and made sure one cheque was not presented twice.\n\nIn some countries such as the US, cheques contain a memo line where the purpose of the cheque can be indicated as a convenience without affecting the official parts of the cheque. In the United Kingdom this is not available and such notes are sometimes written on the reverse side of the cheque.\n\nIn the US, at the top (when cheque oriented vertically) of the reverse side of the cheque, there are usually one or more blank lines labelled something like \"Endorse here\".\n\nStarting in the 1960s, machine readable routing and account information was added to the bottom of cheques in [[MICR]] format. This allowed automated sorting and routing of cheques between banks and led to automated central clearing facilities. The information provided at the bottom of the cheque is country-specific and is driven by each country's cheque clearing system. This means that the payee no longer has to go to the bank that issued the cheque, instead they can deposit it at their own bank or any other banks and the cheque would be routed back to the originating bank, and funds transferred to their own bank account.\n\nIn the US, the bottom 5/8\"<ref>[http://www.troygroup.com/support/documents/50-70300-001_CMICRBasicsHandbook_000.pdf MICR Basics Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421060830/http://www.troygroup.com/support/documents/50-70300-001_CMICRBasicsHandbook_000.pdf |date=21 April 2015 }}</ref> of the cheque is a keep out zone reserved for MICR characters only, which should not be intruded upon by handwriting. One must be especially careful of lowercase descenders when filling out the signature and memo lines which are often at the bottom of the cheque in close proximity. It is advisable to treat the signature and memo lines as boundaries rather than baselines and sign above them. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbanksupply.com/index.cfm/go2/view/pID/233/n/micr-1_1%7C8qmark-x-8_1%7C2qmark-check-correction-strips |title=SKU: USCST850, U.S. Bank Supply, Retrieved 2016-03-20 |publisher=Usbanksupply.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref> and glue it to the cheque.

Also, this author received a couple checks with handwriting incursion of the MICR characters which were rejected.</ref> cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time you manually fill in the cheque as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus your sloppy signature could obscure characters that you didn't realize would later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre-printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed cheque forms, allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate electronic copies of cheques.\n\nFor additional protection, a cheque can be [[Crossing of cheques|crossed]], which restricts the use of the cheque so that the funds must be paid into a bank account. The format and wording varies from country to country, but generally two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or in the top left hand corner. In addition the words 'or bearer' must not be used, or if pre-printed on the cheque must be crossed out on the payee line. If the cheque is crossed with the words 'Account Payee' or similar then the cheque can only be paid into the bank account of the person initially named as the payee, thus it cannot be endorsed to a different payee.\n\n=== Attached documents ===\nCheques sometimes include additional documents. A page in a chequebook may consist of both the cheque itself and a stub or ''{{visible anchor|counterfoil}}''&nbsp;\u2013 when the cheque is written, only the cheque itself is detached, and the stub is retained in the chequebook as a record of the cheque. Alternatively, cheques may be recorded with carbon paper behind each cheque, in ledger sheets between cheques or at the back of a chequebook, or in a completely separate transaction register that comes with a chequebook.\n\nWhen a cheque is mailed, a separate letter or \"[[remittance advice]]\" may be attached to inform the recipient of the purpose of the cheque&nbsp;\u2013 formally, which account receivable to credit the funds to. This is frequently done formally using a provided slip when paying a bill, or informally via a letter when sending an ad hoc cheque.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Sweet success.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cheques may be valid regardless of amount.]]Parties to regular cheques generally include a ''drawer'', the depositor writing a cheque; a ''drawee,'' the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment; and a ''payee,'' the entity to whom the drawer issues the cheque. The drawer ''drafts'' or ''draws'' a cheque, which is also called ''cutting a cheque'', especially in the US. There may also be a ''beneficiary''\u2014for example, in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account, the payee will be the custodian, but the cheque may be marked \"F/B/O\" (\"for the benefit of\") the beneficiary.\n\nUltimately, there is also at least one ''endorsee'' which would typically be the financial institution servicing the payee's account, or in some circumstances may be a third party to whom the payee owes or wishes to give money.\n\nA payee that accepts a cheque will typically [[deposit account|deposit]] it in an account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to a branch of the drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the cheque has been ''[[Non-sufficient funds|dishonoured]]''. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a \"paid\" stamp. The cheque is now a ''cancelled cheque''. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.\n\nCheques can be lost or go astray within the cycle, or be delayed if further verification is needed in the case of suspected fraud. A cheque may thus bounce some time after it has been deposited.\n\n[[File:110512-F-PO994-029 Annual Volunteer Recognition Ceremony 2011 Moody Air Force Base.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Symbolic cheques are used at events to depict money offered to the payee.]]\nFollowing concerns about the amount of time it took the [[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company]] to clear cheques, the United Kingdom [[Office of Fair Trading]] set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining.<ref name=\"OFT\">{{cite web| title = Cheques Working Group Report| url = http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/reports/financial_products/oft868.pdf| publisher = The Office of Fair Trading| location = London| page = 297| date = November 2006| accessdate = 26 May 2009| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319173648/http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/reports/financial_products/oft868.pdf| archivedate = 19 March 2009| df = dmy-all}}</ref> However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque. To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the \"certainty of fate\" principle.\n\nAn advantage to the drawer of using cheques instead of [[debit card]] transactions, is that they know the drawer's bank will not release the money until several days later. Paying with a cheque and making a deposit before it clears the drawer's bank is called \"[[check kiting|kiting]]\" or \"floating\" and is generally illegal in the US, but rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple chequing accounts with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal the funds.\n\n== Declining use ==\nCheque usage has been declining for some years, both for [[point of sale]] transactions (for which credit cards and [[debit card]]s are increasingly preferred) and for third party payments (for example, bill payments), where the decline has been accelerated by the emergence of telephone banking and [[online banking]]. Being paper-based, cheques are costly for banks to process in comparison to electronic payments, so banks in many countries now discourage the use of cheques, either by charging for cheques or by making the alternatives more attractive to customers. In particular the handling of money transfer requires more effort and is time consuming. The cheque has to be handed over in person or sent through mail. The rise of [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs) means that small amounts of cash are often easily accessible, so that it is sometimes unnecessary to write a cheque for such amounts instead.\n\n=== Alternatives to cheques ===\nAlternative [[payment system]]s include:\n\n# [[Cash]]\n# [[Debit card]] payments\n# Credit card payments\n# [[Direct debit]] (initiated by payee)\n# [[Direct credit]] (initiated by payer), [[Automated Clearing House|ACH]] in US, [[giro]] in Europe, [[Direct entry|Direct Entry]] in Australia\n# [[Wire transfer]] (local and international) such as [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]]\n# [[Electronic bill payment]]s using [[Internet banking]]\n# [[E-commerce payment system|Online payment services]], e.g. [[PayPal]], [[Unified Payments Interface]], [[PhonePe]], [[Paytm]] and [[Worldpay]]\n# [[Money orders]]\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, even for third party payments. In these countries, it is standard practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, to facilitate the receipt of payments by [[giro]]. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using [[automated teller machine|ATMs]], which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing the name of the payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a giro transfer, the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account. By writing the paper cheque, he is handing the far end of the rope to the payee, who will pull in his own good time. In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance.\n\nIn Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques have almost completely vanished in favour of direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called ''{{ill|acceptgiros|nl|Acceptgiro|vertical-align=sup}}'' (Netherlands) or ''{{ill|\u00dcberweisungstr\u00e4ger|de|\u00dcberweisungstr\u00e4ger|vertical-align=sup}}'' (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (''[[Direct debit#Germany|Lastschrifteinzug]]'' (German) or ''[[Direct debit#Netherlands|Incasso (machtiging)]]'' (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit rather than as a payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple [[ATM card]]s for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the [[Eurocheque]]. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.\n\nIn Finland, banks stopped issuing personal cheques in about 1993 in favour of giro systems, which are now almost exclusively electronically initiated either via internet banking or payment machines located at banks and shopping malls. All [[Nordic countries]] have used an interconnected international giro system since the 1950s, and in Sweden, cheques are now almost totally abandoned; in Denmark, all banks stopped accepting cheques starting on January 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite news| title = Denmark officially kills the cheque| url = https://www.thelocal.dk/20161229/denmark-officially-kills-the-cheque| date = 16 December 2016| accessdate = 2 December 2017}}</ref> Debit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash. For large shop payments, such as car purchases, a type of cheque, a [[money order]] (Swedish:postv\u00e4xel) is still used.\n\nIn Poland cheques were withdrawn from use in 2006, mainly because of lack of popularity due to the widespread adoption of [[Credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]]s. Electronic payments across the European Union are now fast and inexpensive\u2014usually free for consumers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques are still popular, partly because cheques remain free of charge to personal customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments.<ref name=\"wanes\">{{cite news| title = Popularity of cheques wanes| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2151881.stm| work=BBC News| location = London| date = 25 July 2002| accessdate = 26 May 2009}}</ref> Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by [[direct debit]] than for other payment methods, including electronic methods.

Banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them electronically between banks. Cheque clearing is usually done through an electronic cheque broker, such as [[The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC|The Clearing House]], Viewpointe LLC or the Federal Reserve Banks. Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, and this is why some cheque archives have grown to 20 [[petabyte]]s. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer's account ([[direct debit]]). Many people in the US still use paper [[money order]]s to pay bills or transfer money which is a unique type of cheque. They have security advantages over mailing cash, and do not require access to a bank account.<ref name=\"OECD1\"/>\n\nCanada's usage of cheques is less than that of the US and is declining rapidly at the urging of the Canadian Banking Association.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cba.ca/b2b-mobile-payments |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118054145/http://www.cba.ca/b2b-mobile-payments |archive-date=18 January 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Government of Canada claims it is 6.5 times more expensive to mail a cheque than to make a direct deposit.

Financial institutions also facilitate transfers between accounts within different institutions with the [[Email Money Transfer]] (EMT) service.\n\nCheques are still used for government payments, payroll, rent, and utility bill payments, though [[direct deposit]]s and online or telephone bill payments are more widely and increasingly used.\n\nThe Canadian government began phasing out all government cheques from April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Please select all that apply |url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/direct-deposit/ |title=Direct deposit - Canada.ca |publisher=Servicecanada.gc.ca |date=2015-12-07 |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Asia ===\nIn many Asian countries cheques were never widely used and generally only used by the wealthy, with [[cash]] being used for the majority of payments. Where cheques were used they have been declining rapidly, by 2009 there was negligible consumer cheque usage in Japan, South Korea and [[Taiwan]]. This declining trend was accelerated by these developed markets advanced financial services infrastructure. Many of the developing countries in Asia have seen an increasing use of [[electronic payment]] systems, 'leap-frogging' the less efficient chequeing system altogether.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.euromonitor.com/2010/05/green-payment-movement-set-to-impact-the-american-consumer-payments-landscape.html |title='Green payment' movement set to impact the American payments landscape |publisher=euromonitor.com |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIndia is one of the few countries in Asia that did have significant cheque usage. It had a long tradition of using cheques and passed laws formalising cheque usage as early as 1881. In 2009 cheques were still widely used as a means of payment in trade, and also by individuals to pay other individuals or utility bills. One of the reasons was that banks usually provided cheques for free to their individual account holders. However, cheques are now rarely accepted at [[point of sale]] in retail stores where cash and [[Bank card|cards]] are payment methods of choice. Electronic payment transfer continued to gain popularity in India and like other countries this caused a subsequent reduction in volumes of cheques issued each year. In 2009 the [[Reserve Bank of India]] reported there was a five percent decline in cheque usage compared to the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Etransactions_grow_cheque_usage_drops_5_percent-nid-60731.html |title=E-transactions grow, cheque usage drops 5 percent |date=27 August 2009 |publisher=SiliconIndia news}}</ref>\n\n=== Oceania ===\nIn Australia, following global trends, the use of cheques continues to decline. In 1994 the value of daily cheque transactions was A$25&nbsp;billion; by 2004 this had dropped to only A$5&nbsp;billion, and by 2018 this had dropped to only A$1&nbsp;billion, with almost half of this for [[Business-to-business|B2B transactions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2018/pdf/trends-in-payments-clearing-and-settlement-systems.pdf |title= Trends in payments clearing and settlement systems |work= Reserve Bank of Australia |date = August 2018|accessdate= 2019-11-21}}</ref> Personal cheque use is practically non-existent thanks to the longstanding use of the [[EFTPOS]] system, [[BPAY]], electronic transfers, and debit cards.\n\nIn New Zealand, payments by cheque have declined since the mid-1990s in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006 cheques lagged well behind [[EFTPOS]] ([[debit card]]) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine per cent of transactions, an annual average of 41 cheque transaction per capita.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/markets_and_payment_operations/ |title= Payment and Settlement Systems in New Zealand |work= Reserve Bank of New Zealand |date = March 2008|accessdate= 2010-09-19}}</ref> Most retail stores no longer accept cheques; those that do often require government-issued identification or a store-issued \"cheque identification card\" before they can be accepted as payment.\n\n== Variations on regular cheques ==\nIn addition to regular cheques, a number of variations were developed to address specific needs or address issues when using a regular cheque.\n\n=== Cashier's cheques and bank drafts ===\n{{Main|Cashier's check}}\n\n[[Cashier's check|Cashier's cheques]] and [[banker's draft]]s, also known as '''bank cheques''', '''banker's cheques''' or '''treasurer's cheques''', are cheques issued against the funds of a financial institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term ''cashier's check'' is used in the US and ''banker's draft'' is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. Cashier's cheques are perceived to be as good as cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed.\n\n=== Certified cheque ===\n{{Main|Certified cheque}}\n\nWhen a [[certified check|certified cheque]] is drawn, the bank operating the account verifies there are currently sufficient funds in the drawer's account to honour the cheque. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot \"bounce\", and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation on the face of the cheque (technically called an ''acceptance'').\n\n=== Payroll cheque ===\n{{Main|Paycheck}}\n\nA cheque used to pay wages may be referred to as a [[Paycheck|payroll cheque]]. Even when the use of cheques for [[payroll|paying wages]] and salaries became rare, the vocabulary \"pay cheque\" still remained commonly used to describe the payment of wages and salaries. Payroll cheques issued by the military to soldiers, or by some other government entities to their employees, beneficiants, and creditors, are referred to as [[Warrant of payment|warrants]].\n\n=== Warrants ===\n{{Main|Warrant of payment}}\n\n'''Warrants''' look like cheques and clear through the banking system like cheques, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a [[deposit account]]. A cheque differs from a warrant in that the warrant is not necessarily payable on demand and may not be negotiable.<ref>{{cite web| title = Cheque| url = http://a-z-dictionaries.com/glossaries/Accounting_Glossary.html#check| work = Glossary of Accounting terms| publisher = A-Z-Dictionaries.com| year = 2005| accessdate = 26 May 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307233656/http://a-z-dictionaries.com/glossaries/Accounting_Glossary.html#check| archive-date = 7 March 2009| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> They are often issued by government entities such as the military to pay wages or suppliers. In this case they are an instruction to the entity's treasurer department to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a specified maturity date.\n\n=== Traveller's cheque ===\n{{Main|Traveller's cheque}}\n\nA [[traveller's cheque]] is designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of paying the issuer for that privilege. Traveller's cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, and people frequently used them on holiday instead of cash as many businesses used to accept traveller's cheques as currency. The use of [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]]s has begun to replace the traveller's cheque as the standard for vacation money due to their convenience and additional security for the retailer. As a result, many businesses no longer accept traveller's cheques.\n\n=== Money or postal order ===\n{{Main|Money order|Postal order}}\n\nA cheque sold by a post office, bank, or merchant such as a grocery store for payment in favour of a third party is referred to as a [[money order]] or [[postal order]]. These are paid for in advance when the order is drawn and are guaranteed by the institution that issues them and can only be paid to the named third party. This was a common way to send low value payments to third parties, avoiding the risks associated with sending cash by post, prior to the advent of electronic payment methods.\n\n=== Oversized cheques ===\n[[File:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the [[Ansari X Prize]] $10 million award]]\n\nOversized cheques are often used in public events such as donating money to charity or giving out prizes such as [[Publishers Clearing House]].

Most banks need to have the machine-readable information on the bottom of cheques read electronically, so only very limited dimensions can be allowed due to standardised equipment.\n\n=== Payment vouchers ===\nIn the US some [[Welfare (financial aid)|public assistance]] programmes such as the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]], or [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] make ''vouchers'' available to their beneficiaries, which are good up to a certain monetary amount for purchase of grocery items deemed eligible under the particular programme. The voucher can be deposited like any other cheque by a participating supermarket or other approved business.\n\n== Cheques around the world ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Cheques Act 1986 is the body of law governing the issuance of cheques and payment orders in Australia. Procedural and practical issues governing the clearance of cheques and payment orders are handled by [[Australian Payments Clearing Association]] (APCA).\n\nIn 1999, banks adopted a system to allow faster clearance of cheques by electronically transmitting information about cheques, this brought clearance times down from five to three days. Prior to that cheques had to be physically transported to the paying bank before processing began. If the cheque was dishonoured, it was physically returned.\n\nAll licensed banks in Australia may issue cheques in their own name. Non-banks are not permitted to issue cheques in their own name but may issue, and have drawn on them, payment orders (which functionally are no different from cheques).\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, cheque sizes and types, endorsement requirements<ref>{{cite web|title=Paying by Cheque|url=https://www.payments.ca/paying-cheque|website=www.payments.ca|publisher=Payments Canada|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=8 August 2016}}</ref> and MICR tolerances<ref>{{cite web|title=Standard 006 \u2013 Specifications for MICR-Encoded Payment Items|url=https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/standard-006_1.pdf|website=payments.ca|publisher=Canadian Payments Association|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127085005/https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/standard-006_1.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are overseen by [[Canadian Payments Association|Payments Canada]].\n* Canadian cheques can legally be written in English, French or [[Inuktitut]].\n* A tele-cheque is a paper payment item that resembles a cheque except that it is neither created nor signed by the payer\u2014instead it is created (and may be signed) by a third party on behalf of the payer.

In 1881, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act)<ref>{{cite web|title=Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, India|url=http://devgan.in/negotiable_instruments_act/}}</ref> was enacted in India, formalising the usage and characteristics of instruments like the cheque, the bill of exchange, and promissory note. The NI Act provided a legal framework for non-cash paper payment instruments in India.<ref name=\"rbi.org.in\"/> In 1938, the Calcutta Clearing Banks' Association, which was the largest bankers' association at that time, adopted clearing house.<ref name=\"rbi.org.in\"/>\n\nUntil 1 April 2012, cheques in India were valid for a period of six months from the date of their issue, before the [[Reserve Bank of India]] issued a notification reducing their validity to three months from the date of issue.<ref name=\"indiachequevalid\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-21/bangalore/31219697_1_validity-cheques-monetary-instruments|title=Cheques valid for 3 months from April 1|date=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=30 April 2012|location=Bangalore}}</ref>\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan, cheques are called {{Nihongo|'''Kogitte'''|[[:ja:\u5c0f\u5207\u624b|\u5c0f\u5207\u624b]]}}, and are governed by {{ill|Kogitte Law|ja|\u5c0f\u5207\u624b\u6cd5|vertical-align=sup}}. \n\nBounced cheques are called {{Nihongo|Fuwatari Kogitte|{{ill|\u4e0d\u6e21\u308a|ja|\u4e0d\u6e21\u308a|vertical-align=sup}}\u5c0f\u5207\u624b}}. If an account owner bounces two cheques in six months, the bank will suspend the account for two years. If the account belongs to a public company, their stock will also be suspended from trading on the stock exchange, which can lead to bankruptcy.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nInstrument-specific legislation includes the Cheques Act 1960, part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for [[cheque truncation]] and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of all or part of the cheque to the paying bank's branch, instead of cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time and eliminated the costs of physically moving the cheque.\n\nThe [[:Category:Banks of New Zealand|registered banks]] under supervision of [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] provide the cheque payment services. Once banked, cheques are processed electronically together with other retail payment instruments. ''[[Homeguard v Kiwi Packaging]]'' is often cited case law regarding the banking of cheques tendered as full settlement of disputed accounts.<ref>[1981] 2 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 322</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the UK all cheques must now conform to an industry standard detailing layout and font (\"[[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company]] (C&CCC) Standard 3\"), be printed on a specific weight of paper (CBS1), and contain explicitly defined security features.\n\nSince 1995, all cheque printers must be members of the Cheque Printer Accreditation Scheme (CPAS). The scheme is managed by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company and requires that all cheques for use in the British clearing process are produced by accredited printers who have adopted stringent security standards.\n\nThe rules concerning crossed cheques are set out in Section 1 of the Cheques Act 1992 and prevent cheques being cashed by or paid into the accounts of third parties. On a crossed cheque the words \u201caccount payee only\u201d (or similar) are printed between two parallel vertical lines in the centre of the cheque. This makes the cheque non-transferable and is to avoid cheques being endorsed and paid into an account other than that of the named payee. Crossing cheques basically ensures that the money is paid into an account of the intended beneficiary of the cheque.\n\nFollowing concerns about the amount of time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom [[Office of Fair Trading]] set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report<ref name=\"OFT\"/> recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007.<ref name=\"Brignall\">{{cite news| first = Brignall| last = Miles| title = Cheque changes leave consumers in the clear| url = https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/nov/30/consumeraffairs.banks|work=Guardian | location = London| date = 30 November 2007| accessdate  = 26 May 2009}}</ref> In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient's account (usually the day of deposit) was designated \"T\". At \"T + 2\" (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipient's account. At \"T + 4\" clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at \"T + 6\" on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank's discretion). \"T + 6\" is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient's permission\u2014this is known as \"certainty of fate\". Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the \"fate\" of a cheque has been \"Special Presentation\", which would normally involve a fee, where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time. \"Special Presentation\" had been stated at the time of deposit.\n\nCheque volumes peaked in 1990 when four billion cheque payments were made. Of these, 2.5&nbsp;billion were cleared through the inter-bank clearing managed by the C&CCC, the remaining 1.5&nbsp;billion being in-house cheques which were either paid into the branch on which they were drawn or processed intra-bank without going through the clearings. As volumes started to fall, the challenges faced by the clearing banks were then of a different nature: how to benefit from technology improvements in a declining business environment.\n\nAlthough the UK did not adopt the euro as its national currency when other European countries did in 1999, many banks began offering euro denominated accounts with chequebooks, principally to business customers. The cheques can be used to pay for certain goods and services in the UK. The same year, the C&CCC set up the euro cheque clearing system to process euro denominated cheques separately from sterling cheques in Great Britain.\n\nThe UK [[Payments Council]] from 30 June 2011 withdrew the existing ''Cheque Guarantee Card Scheme'' in the UK.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13947510 | work=BBC News | title=R.I.P.

It is often left blank\u2014hence sometimes called a \"blank check\", though this term has other uses\u2014and is used for purposes of withdrawal.\n\nIn the US, the terminology for a cheque historically varied with the type of financial institution on which it is drawn. In the case of a [[savings and loan association]] it was a ''negotiable order of withdrawal'' (compare [[Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account]]); if a [[credit union]] it was a ''share draft.'' \"Checks\" were associated with chartered commercial banks. However, common usage has increasingly conformed to more recent versions of Article 3, where ''check'' means any or all of these negotiable instruments. Certain types of cheques drawn on a government agency, especially payroll cheques, may be called a ''payroll warrant''.\n\nAt the bottom of each cheque there is the routing/account number in [[MICR]] format. The [[ABA routing transit number]] is a nine-digit number in which the first four digits identifies the [[US Federal Reserve Bank]]'s cheque-processing centre. This is followed by digits 5 through 8, identifying the specific bank served by that cheque-processing centre. Digit 9 is a verification [[check digit]], computed using a complex algorithm of the previous eight digits.<ref name=\"supersat_tech: Inside Check Numbers\">{{cite web |url=http://supersat-tech.livejournal.com/3727.html |title=Inside Check Numbers |publisher=Supersat-tech.livejournal.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921204935/http://supersat-tech.livejournal.com/3727.html|archivedate=21 September 2007}}</ref>\n* Typically the routing number is followed by a group of eight or nine MICR digits that indicates the particular account number at that bank. The account number is assigned independently by the various banks.\n* Typically the account number is followed by a group of three or four MICR digits that indicates a particular cheque number from that account.\n* Directional routing number\u2014also known as the transit number, consists of a denominator mirroring the first four digits of the routing number, and a hyphenated numerator, also known as the ABA number, in which the first part is a city code (1\u201349), if the account is in one of 49 specific cities, or a state code (50\u201399) if it is not in one of those specific cities; the second part of the hyphenated numerator mirrors the 5th through 8th digits of the routing number with leading zeros removed.<ref name=\"supersat_tech: Inside Check Numbers\"/>\n\nA ''draft'' in the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] is any bill of exchange, whether payable on demand or at a later date. If payable on demand it is a \"[[demand draft]]\", or if drawn on a financial institution, a cheque.\n\nThe electronic cheque or [[Substitute check in United States|substitute cheque]] was formally adopted in the US in 2004 with the passing of the \"Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act\" (or [[Check 21 Act]]). This allowed the creation of electronic cheques and translation ([[Cheque truncation|truncation]]) of paper cheques into electronic replacements, reducing cost and processing time.\n\nThe specification for US cheques is given by ANSI committee X9 Technical Report 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=X9 TR-2:2005 Understanding, Designing Producing Checks|url=http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=X9+TR-2%3A2005|website=webstore.ansi.org|publisher=ANSI|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nIn Turkey, cheques are usually used for commercial transactions only, and using post-dated cheques is legally permissible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/02/20120203M1-1.htm |title=\u00c7EK KANUNUNDA DE\u011e\u0130\u015e\u0130KL\u0130K YAPILMASINA DA\u0130R KANUN |language=Turkish}}</ref>\n\n== Cheque fraud ==\n{{Main|Cheque fraud}}\n\nCheques have been a tempting target for criminals to steal money or goods from the drawer, payee or the banks. A number of measures have been introduced to combat fraud over the years. These range from things like writing a cheque so it is difficult to alter after it is drawn, to mechanisms like crossing a cheque so that it can only be paid into another bank's account providing some traceability. However, the inherent security weaknesses of cheques as a payment method, such as having only the signature as the main [[authentication]] method and not knowing if funds will be received until the clearing cycle to complete, have made them vulnerable to a number of different types of fraud.\n\n=== Embezzlement ===\nTaking advantage of the float period ([[cheque kiting]]) to delay the notice of non-existent funds. This often involves trying to convince a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear, giving time for the fraudster to disappear.\n\n=== Forgery ===\nSometimes, forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. One form of forgery involves the use of a victim's legitimate cheques, that have either been stolen and then cashed, or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator, by adding words or digits to inflate the amount.\n\n=== Identity theft ===\nSince cheques include significant personal information (name, account number, signature and in some countries driver's license number, the address or phone number of the account holder), they can be used for [[identity theft]]. The practice was discontinued as identity theft became widespread.\n\n== Dishonoured cheques ==\nA dishonoured cheque cannot be redeemed for its value and is worthless; they are also known as an ''RDI'' (returned deposit item), or ''NSF'' ([[non-sufficient funds]]) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer's account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer's account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds is said to have ''bounced'' and may be called a ''rubber cheque''.<ref name=\"Garner\">{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=A dictionary of modern legal usage|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507769-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode00garn_0/page/953 953]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode00garn_0/page/953}}</ref> Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque, and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a ''stop'' on a cheque, instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque.\n\nIn [[England and Wales]], they are typically returned marked \"Refer to Drawer\"\u2014an instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why the cheque was not honoured. This wording was brought in after a bank was successfully sued for [[libel]] after returning a cheque with the phrase \"Insufficient Funds\" after making an error\u2014the court ruled that as there were sufficient funds the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque. Despite the use of this revised phrase, successful libel lawsuits brought against banks by individuals remained for similar errors.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bounced-cheques-yield-libel-damages-1534499.html |title=Bounced cheques yield libel damages |date=21 July 1992 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |accessdate=24 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, a cheque acts as an assignment of the amount of money to the payee. As such, if a cheque is dishonoured in Scotland, what funds are present in the bank account are \"attached\" and frozen, until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the cheque, the drawer recovers the cheque and hands it into the bank, or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the cheque.\n\nA cheque may also be dishonoured because it is stale or not cashed within a \"void after date\". Many cheques have an explicit notice printed on the cheque that it is void after some period of days. In the US, banks are not required by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] to honour a '''{{visible anchor|stale-dated cheque}},''' which is a cheque presented six months after it is dated.<ref name=\"ucc4.404\">{{cite web| title=Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4-404| publisher=United States Congress| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/4/article4.htm#s4-404| quote=A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a chequing account to pay a cheque, other than a certified cheque, which is presented more than six months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith.}}</ref>\n\n=== Consumer reporting ===\nIn the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as [[ChexSystems]], Early Warning Services, and [[First Data|TeleCheck]] have been providing [[check verification service|cheque verification services]] that track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank can not afford an account to be overdrawn.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tugend |first=Alina |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/24/business/24shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all |title=New York Times |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/16/pf/bank-account-history/index.html?iid=EL|title=Bank customers - you're being tracked|author=Blake Ellis|date=16 August 2012|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/16/pf/CFPB-credit-reporting/index.htm?iid=EL|title=CFPB to supervise credit reporting agencies|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, in common with other items such as [[Direct Debit]]s or [[standing order (banking)|standing orders]], dishonoured cheques can be reported on a customer's credit file, although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst banks. Dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked in the same manner as missed payments on the customer's credit report.\n\n== Lock box ==\n{{Main|Lock box}}\n\nTypically when customers pay bills with cheques (like gas or water bills), the mail will go to a \"[[lock box]]\" at the post office. There a bank will pick up all the mail, sort it, open it, take the cheques and [[remittance advice]] out, process it all through electronic machinery, and post the funds to the proper accounts. In modern systems, taking advantage of the [[Check 21 Act]], as in the US, many cheques are transformed into electronic objects and the paper is destroyed.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n* [[Allonge]] - slip of paper attached to a cheque used to endorse it when there is not enough space.\n* [[Blank cheque]] - cheque where amount has been left blank.\n* [[Certified check|Certified cheque]] - guaranteed by a bank.\n* [[E-check|E-cheque]] - electronic fund transfer.\n* [[Hundi]] - historic Indian cheque like instrument.\n* [[Labour cheque]] - political concept to distribute goods in exchange for work.\n* [[Negotiable cow]] - urban legend where a cow was used as a cheque.\n* [[Remote deposit]] - scanning of cheques and transmitting to the bank electronically.\n* [[Substitute check|Substitute cheque]] - the act of scanning paper cheques and turning them into electronic payments.\n* [[Transit check]] - a cheque which is drawn on another bank than that at which it is presented for payment.\n* [[Traveler's cheque]] - a pre-paid cheque that could be used to make payments in stores.\n* [[Railway pay cheques]] - identification used to collect railway workers pay packet.\n\n== References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{external links|date=February 2013}}\n{{Commons category|lcf=yes}}\n* [https://archive.is/20121223063148/http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/GOLD/thumbs?class_mark=T-S_Ar.30.184 Cheques found in the Cairo Geniza from the 12th century]\n\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Accounting source documents]]\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Numismatics]]\n[[Category:Cheques| ]]\n[[Category:Paper products]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:CanadianChequeSample.png|222px|thumb|right|A cheque sample from Canada, 2006]]\n{{Banking |transfer}}\n{{Numismatics}}\n[[File:Jefferson, Thomas (signature on check).jpg|thumb|A cheque with [[Thomas Jefferson]] as payee and payor from 1809]]\n[[File:Whitney Bank New Orleans Check 1905.jpg|thumb|222px|A cheque from 1905]] \n[[File:1933 South African cheque.jpg|thumb|right|222px|A cheque from 1933]]\n\nA '''cheque''', or '''check''' ([[American English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences|see spelling differences]]), is a document that orders a bank to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued. The person writing the cheque, known as the ''[[Payor|drawer]]'', has a [[transactional account|transaction banking account]] (often called a current, cheque, chequing or checking account) where their money is held. The drawer writes the various details including the [[monetary]] amount, date, and a [[payee]] on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the ''drawee'', to pay that person or company the amount of money stated.\n\nCheques are a type of [[Negotiable instrument#Bill of exchange|bill of exchange]] that were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money. [[Banknote|Paper money]] evolved from [[promissory note]]s, another form of negotiable instrument similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession (the \"[[Bearer instrument|bearer]]\").\n\nA cheque is a [[negotiable instrument]] instructing a [[financial institution]] to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified [[transactional account]] held in the drawer's name with that institution. Both the drawer and payee may be [[natural person]]s or [[Juristic person|legal entities]]. Cheques are ''order instruments'', and are not in general payable simply to the bearer as [[bearer instrument]]s are, but must be paid to the payee. In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid.\n\nAlthough forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular non-[[cash]] method for making [[payment]]s and the usage of cheques peaked. By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/resources_publications/key_facts_and_figures/cheques_and_bankers'_drafts_facts_and_figures/ |title=Cheques and Bankers' Drafts Facts and Figures |work=UK Payment Administration |publisher=UKPA |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613101220/http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/resources_publications/key_facts_and_figures/cheques_and_bankers%27_drafts_facts_and_figures/ |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since then cheque usage has fallen, being partly replaced by electronic payment systems.

Such an order was referred to as a ''[[Negotiable instrument#Bill of exchange|bill of exchange]]''. The use of bills of exchange facilitated trade by eliminating the need for merchants to carry large quantities of currency (for example, gold) to purchase goods and services.\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThere is early evidence of using cheques. In India, during the [[Maurya Empire]] (from 321 to 185 BC), a commercial instrument called the adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=155 | title=Reserve Bank of India - Publications}}</ref>\n\nThe ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as ''praescriptiones'' in the 1st century BCE.<ref name=\"Durant\">{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=    Caesar and Christ : a history of Roman civilization and of Christianity from their beginnings to A.D. 325|series=The story of civilization|volume=3|year=1944|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|page=749}}</ref>\n\nBeginning in the third century CE, banks in [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] territory began to issue letters of credit.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Safari|first1=Meysam|title=Contractual structures and payoff patterns of Suk\u016bk securities|journal=International Journal of Banking and Finance|year=2013|volume=10|issue=2|quote= During the 3rd century AD, financial firms in Persia (currently known as Iran) and other territories in the Persian Sassanid Dynasty  issued  letters  of  credit  known  as  \u201cchak\u201d|ssrn=2386365}}</ref> These letters were termed ''\u010dak'', meaning \"document\" or \"contract\".<ref>Ilya Yakubovich.

These cashiers held the money for a fee. Competition drove cashiers to offer additional services including paying money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so. They kept the note as proof of payment. This concept went on to spread to England and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wachovia.com/file/checks_and_check_fraud.pdf |title=Guide to Checks and Check Fraud |publisher=[[Wachovia Bank]] |page=4 |year=2003 }}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nBy the 17th century, bills of exchange were being used for domestic payments in England.

These forms were printed on \"cheque paper\" to prevent fraud, and customers had to attend in person and obtain a numbered form from the cashier. Once written, the cheque was brought back to the bank for settlement. The suppression of banknotes in eighteenth-century England further promoted the use of cheques.<ref>[http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/er08no4_QuinnRoberds.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, ''The Evolution of the cheque as a Means of Payment: A Historical Survey'', 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019001522/http://www.frbatlanta.org/filelegacydocs/er08no4_QuinnRoberds.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nUntil about 1770, an informal exchange of cheques took place between London banks. Clerks of each bank visited all the other banks to exchange cheques, whilst keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other. Daily [[cheque clearing]] began around 1770 when the bank clerks met at the Five Bells, a tavern in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] in the City of London, to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash. This was the first [[bankers' clearing house]].\n\nProvincial clearing houses were established in major cities throughout the UK to facilitate the clearing of cheques on banks in the same town.

These ''cheque books'' became a common format for the distribution of cheques to bank customers.\n\nIn the late 19th century, several countries formalized laws regarding cheques.

This is a \"crossed cheque\" disallowing transfer of payment to another account.]]\n\nIn 1931 an attempt was made to simplify the international use of cheques by the [[Geneva Convention on the Unification of the Law Relating to Cheques]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/un.sg.report.itl.development.1966/1.html|title=1 - Progressive Development of the Law of International Trade: Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 1966|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015|year=1966}}</ref> Many European and South American states as well as Japan joined the convention. However, countries including the US and members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] did not participate and so it remained very difficult for cheques to be used across country borders.\n\nIn 1959 a standard for machine-readable characters ([[MICR]]) was agreed and patented in the US for use with cheques. This opened the way for the first automated reader/sorting machines for clearing cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change in the way in which cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-[[cash]] method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined.\n\nIn 1969 [[cheque guarantee card]]s were introduced in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honoured when used at a [[point of sale]]. The drawer would sign the cheque in front of the retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number on the back of the cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by [[debit cards]], starting in the mid-1990s.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s, many countries enacted laws to allow for [[cheque truncation]], in which a physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or clearing-house. This eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs.\n\nIn 2002, the [[Eurocheque]] system was phased out and replaced with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. <!-- Some European countries phased out the use of cheques altogether when the [[Eurocheque]] system, which they had used as their domestic cheque-clearing system, ceased on 1 January 2002. --> At that time, a number of countries took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.\n\n== Parts of a cheque ==\n[[File:BritishChequeAnnotated.png|frame|Parts of a cheque based on a UK example\n{{ordered list\n| drawee, the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment\n| payee\n| date of issue\n| amount of currency\n| drawer, the person or entity making the cheque\n| signature of drawer\n| Machine readable routing and account information\n}}]]\n\nThe four main items on a cheque are\n* ''Drawer'', the person or entity who makes the cheque\n* ''Payee'', the recipient of the money\n* ''Drawee'', the bank or other financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment\n* ''Amount'', the currency amount\n\nAs cheque usage increased during the 19th and 20th centuries, additional items were added to increase security or to make processing easier for the bank or financial institution. A signature of the drawer was required to authorize the cheque, and this is the main way to authenticate the cheque. Second, it became customary to write the amount in words as well as in numbers to avoid mistakes and make it harder to fraudulently alter the amount after the cheque had been written. It is not a legal requirement to write down the amount in words, although some banks will refuse to accept cheques that do not have the amount in both numbers and words.\n\nAn issue date was added, and cheques may not be valid a certain amount of time after issue.

Conversely, an [[antedated check|antedated cheque]] has an issue date in the past.\n\nA cheque number was added and cheque books were issued so that cheque numbers were sequential. This allowed for some basic fraud detection by banks and made sure one cheque was not presented twice.\n\nIn some countries such as the US, cheques contain a memo line where the purpose of the cheque can be indicated as a convenience without affecting the official parts of the cheque. In the United Kingdom this is not available and such notes are sometimes written on the reverse side of the cheque.\n\nIn the US, at the top (when cheque oriented vertically) of the reverse side of the cheque, there are usually one or more blank lines labelled something like \"Endorse here\".\n\nStarting in the 1960s, machine readable routing and account information was added to the bottom of cheques in [[MICR]] format. This allowed automated sorting and routing of cheques between banks and led to automated central clearing facilities. The information provided at the bottom of the cheque is country-specific and is driven by each country's cheque clearing system. This means that the payee no longer has to go to the bank that issued the cheque, instead they can deposit it at their own bank or any other banks and the cheque would be routed back to the originating bank, and funds transferred to their own bank account.\n\nIn the US, the bottom 5/8\"<ref>[http://www.troygroup.com/support/documents/50-70300-001_CMICRBasicsHandbook_000.pdf MICR Basics Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421060830/http://www.troygroup.com/support/documents/50-70300-001_CMICRBasicsHandbook_000.pdf |date=21 April 2015 }}</ref> of the cheque is a keep out zone reserved for MICR characters only, which should not be intruded upon by handwriting. One must be especially careful of lowercase descenders when filling out the signature and memo lines which are often at the bottom of the cheque in close proximity. It is advisable to treat the signature and memo lines as boundaries rather than baselines and sign above them. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbanksupply.com/index.cfm/go2/view/pID/233/n/micr-1_1%7C8qmark-x-8_1%7C2qmark-check-correction-strips |title=SKU: USCST850, U.S. Bank Supply, Retrieved 2016-03-20 |publisher=Usbanksupply.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref> and glue it to the cheque.

Also, this author received a couple checks with handwriting incursion of the MICR characters which were rejected.</ref> cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time you manually fill in the cheque as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus your sloppy signature could obscure characters that you didn't realize would later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre-printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed cheque forms, allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate electronic copies of cheques.\n\nFor additional protection, a cheque can be [[Crossing of cheques|crossed]], which restricts the use of the cheque so that the funds must be paid into a bank account. The format and wording varies from country to country, but generally two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or in the top left hand corner. In addition the words 'or bearer' must not be used, or if pre-printed on the cheque must be crossed out on the payee line. If the cheque is crossed with the words 'Account Payee' or similar then the cheque can only be paid into the bank account of the person initially named as the payee, thus it cannot be endorsed to a different payee.\n\n=== Attached documents ===\nCheques sometimes include additional documents. A page in a chequebook may consist of both the cheque itself and a stub or ''{{visible anchor|counterfoil}}''&nbsp;\u2013 when the cheque is written, only the cheque itself is detached, and the stub is retained in the chequebook as a record of the cheque. Alternatively, cheques may be recorded with carbon paper behind each cheque, in ledger sheets between cheques or at the back of a chequebook, or in a completely separate transaction register that comes with a chequebook.\n\nWhen a cheque is mailed, a separate letter or \"[[remittance advice]]\" may be attached to inform the recipient of the purpose of the cheque&nbsp;\u2013 formally, which account receivable to credit the funds to. This is frequently done formally using a provided slip when paying a bill, or informally via a letter when sending an ad hoc cheque.\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Sweet success.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Cheques may be valid regardless of amount.]]Parties to regular cheques generally include a ''drawer'', the depositor writing a cheque; a ''drawee,'' the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment; and a ''payee,'' the entity to whom the drawer issues the cheque. The drawer ''drafts'' or ''draws'' a cheque, which is also called ''cutting a cheque'', especially in the US. There may also be a ''beneficiary''\u2014for example, in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account, the payee will be the custodian, but the cheque may be marked \"F/B/O\" (\"for the benefit of\") the beneficiary.\n\nUltimately, there is also at least one ''endorsee'' which would typically be the financial institution servicing the payee's account, or in some circumstances may be a third party to whom the payee owes or wishes to give money.\n\nA payee that accepts a cheque will typically [[deposit account|deposit]] it in an account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to a branch of the drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the cheque has been ''[[Non-sufficient funds|dishonoured]]''. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a \"paid\" stamp. The cheque is now a ''cancelled cheque''. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.\n\nCheques can be lost or go astray within the cycle, or be delayed if further verification is needed in the case of suspected fraud. A cheque may thus bounce some time after it has been deposited.\n\n[[File:110512-F-PO994-029 Annual Volunteer Recognition Ceremony 2011 Moody Air Force Base.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Symbolic cheques are used at events to depict money offered to the payee.]]\nFollowing concerns about the amount of time it took the [[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company]] to clear cheques, the United Kingdom [[Office of Fair Trading]] set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining.<ref name=\"OFT\">{{cite web| title = Cheques Working Group Report| url = http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/reports/financial_products/oft868.pdf| publisher = The Office of Fair Trading| location = London| page = 297| date = November 2006| accessdate = 26 May 2009| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319173648/http://www.oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/reports/financial_products/oft868.pdf| archivedate = 19 March 2009| df = dmy-all}}</ref> However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque. To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the \"certainty of fate\" principle.\n\nAn advantage to the drawer of using cheques instead of [[debit card]] transactions, is that they know the drawer's bank will not release the money until several days later. Paying with a cheque and making a deposit before it clears the drawer's bank is called \"[[check kiting|kiting]]\" or \"floating\" and is generally illegal in the US, but rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple chequing accounts with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal the funds.\n\n== Declining use ==\nCheque usage has been declining for some years, both for [[point of sale]] transactions (for which credit cards and [[debit card]]s are increasingly preferred) and for third party payments (for example, bill payments), where the decline has been accelerated by the emergence of telephone banking and [[online banking]]. Being paper-based, cheques are costly for banks to process in comparison to electronic payments, so banks in many countries now discourage the use of cheques, either by charging for cheques or by making the alternatives more attractive to customers. In particular the handling of money transfer requires more effort and is time consuming. The cheque has to be handed over in person or sent through mail. The rise of [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs) means that small amounts of cash are often easily accessible, so that it is sometimes unnecessary to write a cheque for such amounts instead.\n\n=== Alternatives to cheques ===\nAlternative [[payment system]]s include:\n\n# [[Cash]]\n# [[Debit card]] payments\n# Credit card payments\n# [[Direct debit]] (initiated by payee)\n# [[Direct credit]] (initiated by payer), [[Automated Clearing House|ACH]] in US, [[giro]] in Europe, [[Direct entry|Direct Entry]] in Australia\n# [[Wire transfer]] (local and international) such as [[Western Union]] and [[MoneyGram]]\n# [[Electronic bill payment]]s using [[Internet banking]]\n# [[E-commerce payment system|Online payment services]], e.g. [[PayPal]], [[Unified Payments Interface]], [[PhonePe]], [[Paytm]] and [[Worldpay]]\n# [[Money orders]]\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, even for third party payments. In these countries, it is standard practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, to facilitate the receipt of payments by [[giro]]. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using [[automated teller machine|ATMs]], which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing the name of the payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a giro transfer, the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account. By writing the paper cheque, he is handing the far end of the rope to the payee, who will pull in his own good time. In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance.\n\nIn Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques have almost completely vanished in favour of direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so-called ''{{ill|acceptgiros|nl|Acceptgiro|vertical-align=sup}}'' (Netherlands) or ''{{ill|\u00dcberweisungstr\u00e4ger|de|\u00dcberweisungstr\u00e4ger|vertical-align=sup}}'' (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (''[[Direct debit#Germany|Lastschrifteinzug]]'' (German) or ''[[Direct debit#Netherlands|Incasso (machtiging)]]'' (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit rather than as a payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple [[ATM card]]s for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the [[Eurocheque]]. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive.\n\nIn Finland, banks stopped issuing personal cheques in about 1993 in favour of giro systems, which are now almost exclusively electronically initiated either via internet banking or payment machines located at banks and shopping malls. All [[Nordic countries]] have used an interconnected international giro system since the 1950s, and in Sweden, cheques are now almost totally abandoned; in Denmark, all banks stopped accepting cheques starting on January 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite news| title = Denmark officially kills the cheque| url = https://www.thelocal.dk/20161229/denmark-officially-kills-the-cheque| date = 16 December 2016| accessdate = 2 December 2017}}</ref> Debit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash. For large shop payments, such as car purchases, a type of cheque, a [[money order]] (Swedish:postv\u00e4xel) is still used.\n\nIn Poland cheques were withdrawn from use in 2006, mainly because of lack of popularity due to the widespread adoption of [[Credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]]s. Electronic payments across the European Union are now fast and inexpensive\u2014usually free for consumers.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques are still popular, partly because cheques remain free of charge to personal customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments.<ref name=\"wanes\">{{cite news| title = Popularity of cheques wanes| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2151881.stm| work=BBC News| location = London| date = 25 July 2002| accessdate = 26 May 2009}}</ref> Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by [[direct debit]] than for other payment methods, including electronic methods.

Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, and this is why some cheque archives have grown to 20 [[petabyte]]s. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer's account ([[direct debit]]).

Many merchants accept Interac debit payments but not credit card payments, even though most Interac terminals can support credit card payments. Financial institutions also facilitate transfers between accounts within different institutions with the [[Email Money Transfer]] (EMT) service.\n\nCheques are still used for government payments, payroll, rent, and utility bill payments, though [[direct deposit]]s and online or telephone bill payments are more widely and increasingly used.\n\nThe Canadian government began phasing out all government cheques from April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Please select all that apply |url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/sc/direct-deposit/ |title=Direct deposit - Canada.ca |publisher=Servicecanada.gc.ca |date=2015-12-07 |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}\n\n=== Asia ===\nIn many Asian countries cheques were never widely used and generally only used by the wealthy, with [[cash]] being used for the majority of payments. Where cheques were used they have been declining rapidly, by 2009 there was negligible consumer cheque usage in Japan, South Korea and [[Taiwan]]. This declining trend was accelerated by these developed markets advanced financial services infrastructure. Many of the developing countries in Asia have seen an increasing use of [[electronic payment]] systems, 'leap-frogging' the less efficient chequeing system altogether.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.euromonitor.com/2010/05/green-payment-movement-set-to-impact-the-american-consumer-payments-landscape.html |title='Green payment' movement set to impact the American payments landscape |publisher=euromonitor.com |date=4 May 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIndia is one of the few countries in Asia that did have significant cheque usage. It had a long tradition of using cheques and passed laws formalising cheque usage as early as 1881. In 2009 cheques were still widely used as a means of payment in trade, and also by individuals to pay other individuals or utility bills. One of the reasons was that banks usually provided cheques for free to their individual account holders. However, cheques are now rarely accepted at [[point of sale]] in retail stores where cash and [[Bank card|cards]] are payment methods of choice. Electronic payment transfer continued to gain popularity in India and like other countries this caused a subsequent reduction in volumes of cheques issued each year. In 2009 the [[Reserve Bank of India]] reported there was a five percent decline in cheque usage compared to the previous year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/Etransactions_grow_cheque_usage_drops_5_percent-nid-60731.html |title=E-transactions grow, cheque usage drops 5 percent |date=27 August 2009 |publisher=SiliconIndia news}}</ref>\n\n=== Oceania ===\nIn Australia, following global trends, the use of cheques continues to decline. In 1994 the value of daily cheque transactions was A$25&nbsp;billion; by 2004 this had dropped to only A$5&nbsp;billion, and by 2018 this had dropped to only A$1&nbsp;billion, with almost half of this for [[Business-to-business|B2B transactions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2018/pdf/trends-in-payments-clearing-and-settlement-systems.pdf |title= Trends in payments clearing and settlement systems |work= Reserve Bank of Australia |date = August 2018|accessdate= 2019-11-21}}</ref> Personal cheque use is practically non-existent thanks to the longstanding use of the [[EFTPOS]] system, [[BPAY]], electronic transfers, and debit cards.\n\nIn New Zealand, payments by cheque have declined since the mid-1990s in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006 cheques lagged well behind [[EFTPOS]] ([[debit card]]) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine per cent of transactions, an annual average of 41 cheque transaction per capita.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/markets_and_payment_operations/ |title= Payment and Settlement Systems in New Zealand |work= Reserve Bank of New Zealand |date = March 2008|accessdate= 2010-09-19}}</ref> Most retail stores no longer accept cheques; those that do often require government-issued identification or a store-issued \"cheque identification card\" before they can be accepted as payment.\n\n== Variations on regular cheques ==\nIn addition to regular cheques, a number of variations were developed to address specific needs or address issues when using a regular cheque.\n\n=== Cashier's cheques and bank drafts ===\n{{Main|Cashier's check}}\n\n[[Cashier's check|Cashier's cheques]] and [[banker's draft]]s, also known as '''bank cheques''', '''banker's cheques''' or '''treasurer's cheques''', are cheques issued against the funds of a financial institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term ''cashier's check'' is used in the US and ''banker's draft'' is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. Cashier's cheques are perceived to be as good as cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed.\n\n=== Certified cheque ===\n{{Main|Certified cheque}}\n\nWhen a [[certified check|certified cheque]] is drawn, the bank operating the account verifies there are currently sufficient funds in the drawer's account to honour the cheque. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot \"bounce\", and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation on the face of the cheque (technically called an ''acceptance'').\n\n=== Payroll cheque ===\n{{Main|Paycheck}}\n\nA cheque used to pay wages may be referred to as a [[Paycheck|payroll cheque]]. Even when the use of cheques for [[payroll|paying wages]] and salaries became rare, the vocabulary \"pay cheque\" still remained commonly used to describe the payment of wages and salaries. Payroll cheques issued by the military to soldiers, or by some other government entities to their employees, beneficiants, and creditors, are referred to as [[Warrant of payment|warrants]].\n\n=== Warrants ===\n{{Main|Warrant of payment}}\n\n'''Warrants''' look like cheques and clear through the banking system like cheques, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a [[deposit account]]. A cheque differs from a warrant in that the warrant is not necessarily payable on demand and may not be negotiable.<ref>{{cite web| title = Cheque| url = http://a-z-dictionaries.com/glossaries/Accounting_Glossary.html#check| work = Glossary of Accounting terms| publisher = A-Z-Dictionaries.com| year = 2005| accessdate = 26 May 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307233656/http://a-z-dictionaries.com/glossaries/Accounting_Glossary.html#check| archive-date = 7 March 2009| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref> They are often issued by government entities such as the military to pay wages or suppliers. In this case they are an instruction to the entity's treasurer department to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a specified maturity date.\n\n=== Traveller's cheque ===\n{{Main|Traveller's cheque}}\n\nA [[traveller's cheque]] is designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of paying the issuer for that privilege. Traveller's cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, and people frequently used them on holiday instead of cash as many businesses used to accept traveller's cheques as currency. The use of [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]]s has begun to replace the traveller's cheque as the standard for vacation money due to their convenience and additional security for the retailer. As a result, many businesses no longer accept traveller's cheques.\n\n=== Money or postal order ===\n{{Main|Money order|Postal order}}\n\nA cheque sold by a post office, bank, or merchant such as a grocery store for payment in favour of a third party is referred to as a [[money order]] or [[postal order]]. These are paid for in advance when the order is drawn and are guaranteed by the institution that issues them and can only be paid to the named third party. This was a common way to send low value payments to third parties, avoiding the risks associated with sending cash by post, prior to the advent of electronic payment methods.\n\n=== Oversized cheques ===\n[[File:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the [[Ansari X Prize]] $10 million award]]\n\nOversized cheques are often used in public events such as donating money to charity or giving out prizes such as [[Publishers Clearing House]].

Most banks need to have the machine-readable information on the bottom of cheques read electronically, so only very limited dimensions can be allowed due to standardised equipment.\n\n=== Payment vouchers ===\nIn the US some [[Welfare (financial aid)|public assistance]] programmes such as the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]], or [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] make ''vouchers'' available to their beneficiaries, which are good up to a certain monetary amount for purchase of grocery items deemed eligible under the particular programme. The voucher can be deposited like any other cheque by a participating supermarket or other approved business.\n\n== Cheques around the world ==\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Cheques Act 1986 is the body of law governing the issuance of cheques and payment orders in Australia. Procedural and practical issues governing the clearance of cheques and payment orders are handled by [[Australian Payments Clearing Association]] (APCA).\n\nIn 1999, banks adopted a system to allow faster clearance of cheques by electronically transmitting information about cheques, this brought clearance times down from five to three days. Prior to that cheques had to be physically transported to the paying bank before processing began. If the cheque was dishonoured, it was physically returned.\n\nAll licensed banks in Australia may issue cheques in their own name. Non-banks are not permitted to issue cheques in their own name but may issue, and have drawn on them, payment orders (which functionally are no different from cheques).\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, cheque sizes and types, endorsement requirements<ref>{{cite web|title=Paying by Cheque|url=https://www.payments.ca/paying-cheque|website=www.payments.ca|publisher=Payments Canada|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=8 August 2016}}</ref> and MICR tolerances<ref>{{cite web|title=Standard 006 \u2013 Specifications for MICR-Encoded Payment Items|url=https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/standard-006_1.pdf|website=payments.ca|publisher=Canadian Payments Association|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127085005/https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/standard-006_1.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are overseen by [[Canadian Payments Association|Payments Canada]].\n* Canadian cheques can legally be written in English, French or [[Inuktitut]].\n* A tele-cheque is a paper payment item that resembles a cheque except that it is neither created nor signed by the payer\u2014instead it is created (and may be signed) by a third party on behalf of the payer.

In 1881, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act)<ref>{{cite web|title=Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, India|url=http://devgan.in/negotiable_instruments_act/}}</ref> was enacted in India, formalising the usage and characteristics of instruments like the cheque, the bill of exchange, and promissory note. The NI Act provided a legal framework for non-cash paper payment instruments in India.<ref name=\"rbi.org.in\"/> In 1938, the Calcutta Clearing Banks' Association, which was the largest bankers' association at that time, adopted clearing house.<ref name=\"rbi.org.in\"/>\n\nUntil 1 April 2012, cheques in India were valid for a period of six months from the date of their issue, before the [[Reserve Bank of India]] issued a notification reducing their validity to three months from the date of issue.<ref name=\"indiachequevalid\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-21/bangalore/31219697_1_validity-cheques-monetary-instruments|title=Cheques valid for 3 months from April 1|date=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=30 April 2012|location=Bangalore}}</ref>\n\n=== Japan ===\nIn Japan, cheques are called {{Nihongo|'''Kogitte'''|[[:ja:\u5c0f\u5207\u624b|\u5c0f\u5207\u624b]]}}, and are governed by {{ill|Kogitte Law|ja|\u5c0f\u5207\u624b\u6cd5|vertical-align=sup}}. \n\nBounced cheques are called {{Nihongo|Fuwatari Kogitte|{{ill|\u4e0d\u6e21\u308a|ja|\u4e0d\u6e21\u308a|vertical-align=sup}}\u5c0f\u5207\u624b}}. If an account owner bounces two cheques in six months, the bank will suspend the account for two years. If the account belongs to a public company, their stock will also be suspended from trading on the stock exchange, which can lead to bankruptcy.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nInstrument-specific legislation includes the Cheques Act 1960, part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for [[cheque truncation]] and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of all or part of the cheque to the paying bank's branch, instead of cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time and eliminated the costs of physically moving the cheque.\n\nThe [[:Category:Banks of New Zealand|registered banks]] under supervision of [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] provide the cheque payment services. Once banked, cheques are processed electronically together with other retail payment instruments. ''[[Homeguard v Kiwi Packaging]]'' is often cited case law regarding the banking of cheques tendered as full settlement of disputed accounts.<ref>[1981] 2 [[New Zealand Law Reports|NZLR]] 322</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the UK all cheques must now conform to an industry standard detailing layout and font (\"[[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company]] (C&CCC) Standard 3\"), be printed on a specific weight of paper (CBS1), and contain explicitly defined security features.\n\nSince 1995, all cheque printers must be members of the Cheque Printer Accreditation Scheme (CPAS). The scheme is managed by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company and requires that all cheques for use in the British clearing process are produced by accredited printers who have adopted stringent security standards.\n\nThe rules concerning crossed cheques are set out in Section 1 of the Cheques Act 1992 and prevent cheques being cashed by or paid into the accounts of third parties. On a crossed cheque the words \u201caccount payee only\u201d (or similar) are printed between two parallel vertical lines in the centre of the cheque. This makes the cheque non-transferable and is to avoid cheques being endorsed and paid into an account other than that of the named payee. Crossing cheques basically ensures that the money is paid into an account of the intended beneficiary of the cheque.\n\nFollowing concerns about the amount of time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom [[Office of Fair Trading]] set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report<ref name=\"OFT\"/> recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007.<ref name=\"Brignall\">{{cite news| first = Brignall| last = Miles| title = Cheque changes leave consumers in the clear| url = https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/nov/30/consumeraffairs.banks|work=Guardian | location = London| date = 30 November 2007| accessdate  = 26 May 2009}}</ref> In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient's account (usually the day of deposit) was designated \"T\". At \"T + 2\" (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipient's account. At \"T + 4\" clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at \"T + 6\" on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank's discretion). \"T + 6\" is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient's permission\u2014this is known as \"certainty of fate\". Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the \"fate\" of a cheque has been \"Special Presentation\", which would normally involve a fee, where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time. \"Special Presentation\" had been stated at the time of deposit.\n\nCheque volumes peaked in 1990 when four billion cheque payments were made. Of these, 2.5&nbsp;billion were cleared through the inter-bank clearing managed by the C&CCC, the remaining 1.5&nbsp;billion being in-house cheques which were either paid into the branch on which they were drawn or processed intra-bank without going through the clearings. As volumes started to fall, the challenges faced by the clearing banks were then of a different nature: how to benefit from technology improvements in a declining business environment.\n\nAlthough the UK did not adopt the euro as its national currency when other European countries did in 1999, many banks began offering euro denominated accounts with chequebooks, principally to business customers. The cheques can be used to pay for certain goods and services in the UK. The same year, the C&CCC set up the euro cheque clearing system to process euro denominated cheques separately from sterling cheques in Great Britain.\n\nThe UK [[Payments Council]] from 30 June 2011 withdrew the existing ''Cheque Guarantee Card Scheme'' in the UK.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13947510 | work=BBC News | title=R.I.P. Cheque guarantee cards | date=29 June 2011}}</ref> This service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at [[point of sales]] up to a certain value, normally \u00a350 or \u00a3100, when signed in front of the retailer with the additional cheque guarantee card. This was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of [[debit cards]].\n\nThe Payments Council proposed to close the centralised cheque clearing altogether in the UK and had set a target date of 31 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/media_centre/press_releases_new/-/page/855/ |title=Press Releases |publisher=Payments Council |accessdate=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120112829/http://www.paymentscouncil.org.uk/media_centre/press_releases_new/-/page/855/ |archivedate=20 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, on 12 July 2011, the Payments Council announced that after opposition from MPs, charity groups and public opinion, the cheque will remain in use and there would no longer be a reason to seek an alternative paper-initiated payment.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, cheques are referred to as ''checks'' and are governed by Article 3 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], under the rubric of [[negotiable instrument]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/article3.htm|title=U.C.C. - ARTICLE 3 - NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n* An ''order check''\u2014the most common form in the US\u2014is payable only to the named payee or his or her ''endorsee'', as it usually contains the language \"Pay to the order of (name).\"\n* A ''bearer check'' is payable to anyone who is in [[Possession (law)|possession]] of the document: this would be the case if the cheque does not name a payee, or is payable to \"bearer\" or to \"cash\" or \"to the order of cash\", or if the cheque is payable to someone who is not a person or legal entity, for example if the payee line is marked \"Happy Birthday\".\n* A ''[[counter check]]'' is a bank cheque given to customers who have run out of cheques or whose cheques are not yet available. It is often left blank\u2014hence sometimes called a \"blank check\", though this term has other uses\u2014and is used for purposes of withdrawal.\n\nIn the US, the terminology for a cheque historically varied with the type of financial institution on which it is drawn. In the case of a [[savings and loan association]] it was a ''negotiable order of withdrawal'' (compare [[Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account]]); if a [[credit union]] it was a ''share draft.'' \"Checks\" were associated with chartered commercial banks. However, common usage has increasingly conformed to more recent versions of Article 3, where ''check'' means any or all of these negotiable instruments. Certain types of cheques drawn on a government agency, especially payroll cheques, may be called a ''payroll warrant''.\n\nAt the bottom of each cheque there is the routing/account number in [[MICR]] format. The [[ABA routing transit number]] is a nine-digit number in which the first four digits identifies the [[US Federal Reserve Bank]]'s cheque-processing centre. This is followed by digits 5 through 8, identifying the specific bank served by that cheque-processing centre. Digit 9 is a verification [[check digit]], computed using a complex algorithm of the previous eight digits.<ref name=\"supersat_tech: Inside Check Numbers\">{{cite web |url=http://supersat-tech.livejournal.com/3727.html |title=Inside Check Numbers |publisher=Supersat-tech.livejournal.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921204935/http://supersat-tech.livejournal.com/3727.html|archivedate=21 September 2007}}</ref>\n* Typically the routing number is followed by a group of eight or nine MICR digits that indicates the particular account number at that bank. The account number is assigned independently by the various banks.\n* Typically the account number is followed by a group of three or four MICR digits that indicates a particular cheque number from that account.\n* Directional routing number\u2014also known as the transit number, consists of a denominator mirroring the first four digits of the routing number, and a hyphenated numerator, also known as the ABA number, in which the first part is a city code (1\u201349), if the account is in one of 49 specific cities, or a state code (50\u201399) if it is not in one of those specific cities; the second part of the hyphenated numerator mirrors the 5th through 8th digits of the routing number with leading zeros removed.<ref name=\"supersat_tech: Inside Check Numbers\"/>\n\nA ''draft'' in the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] is any bill of exchange, whether payable on demand or at a later date. If payable on demand it is a \"[[demand draft]]\", or if drawn on a financial institution, a cheque.\n\nThe electronic cheque or [[Substitute check in United States|substitute cheque]] was formally adopted in the US in 2004 with the passing of the \"Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act\" (or [[Check 21 Act]]). This allowed the creation of electronic cheques and translation ([[Cheque truncation|truncation]]) of paper cheques into electronic replacements, reducing cost and processing time.\n\nThe specification for US cheques is given by ANSI committee X9 Technical Report 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=X9 TR-2:2005 Understanding, Designing Producing Checks|url=http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=X9+TR-2%3A2005|website=webstore.ansi.org|publisher=ANSI|accessdate=27 November 2016|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Turkey ===\nIn Turkey, cheques are usually used for commercial transactions only, and using post-dated cheques is legally permissible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2012/02/20120203M1-1.htm |title=\u00c7EK KANUNUNDA DE\u011e\u0130\u015e\u0130KL\u0130K YAPILMASINA DA\u0130R KANUN |language=Turkish}}</ref>\n\n== Cheque fraud ==\n{{Main|Cheque fraud}}\n\nCheques have been a tempting target for criminals to steal money or goods from the drawer, payee or the banks. A number of measures have been introduced to combat fraud over the years. These range from things like writing a cheque so it is difficult to alter after it is drawn, to mechanisms like crossing a cheque so that it can only be paid into another bank's account providing some traceability. However, the inherent security weaknesses of cheques as a payment method, such as having only the signature as the main [[authentication]] method and not knowing if funds will be received until the clearing cycle to complete, have made them vulnerable to a number of different types of fraud.\n\n=== Embezzlement ===\nTaking advantage of the float period ([[cheque kiting]]) to delay the notice of non-existent funds. This often involves trying to convince a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear, giving time for the fraudster to disappear.\n\n=== Forgery ===\nSometimes, forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. One form of forgery involves the use of a victim's legitimate cheques, that have either been stolen and then cashed, or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator, by adding words or digits to inflate the amount.\n\n=== Identity theft ===\nSince cheques include significant personal information (name, account number, signature and in some countries driver's license number, the address or phone number of the account holder), they can be used for [[identity theft]]. The practice was discontinued as identity theft became widespread.\n\n== Dishonoured cheques ==\nA dishonoured cheque cannot be redeemed for its value and is worthless; they are also known as an ''RDI'' (returned deposit item), or ''NSF'' ([[non-sufficient funds]]) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer's account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer's account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds is said to have ''bounced'' and may be called a ''rubber cheque''.<ref name=\"Garner\">{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=A dictionary of modern legal usage|edition=2nd|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507769-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode00garn_0/page/953 953]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofmode00garn_0/page/953}}</ref> Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque, and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a ''stop'' on a cheque, instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque.\n\nIn [[England and Wales]], they are typically returned marked \"Refer to Drawer\"\u2014an instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why the cheque was not honoured. This wording was brought in after a bank was successfully sued for [[libel]] after returning a cheque with the phrase \"Insufficient Funds\" after making an error\u2014the court ruled that as there were sufficient funds the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque. Despite the use of this revised phrase, successful libel lawsuits brought against banks by individuals remained for similar errors.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bounced-cheques-yield-libel-damages-1534499.html |title=Bounced cheques yield libel damages |date=21 July 1992 |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |accessdate=24 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, a cheque acts as an assignment of the amount of money to the payee. As such, if a cheque is dishonoured in Scotland, what funds are present in the bank account are \"attached\" and frozen, until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the cheque, the drawer recovers the cheque and hands it into the bank, or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the cheque.\n\nA cheque may also be dishonoured because it is stale or not cashed within a \"void after date\". Many cheques have an explicit notice printed on the cheque that it is void after some period of days. In the US, banks are not required by the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] to honour a '''{{visible anchor|stale-dated cheque}},''' which is a cheque presented six months after it is dated.<ref name=\"ucc4.404\">{{cite web| title=Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 4-404| publisher=United States Congress| url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/4/article4.htm#s4-404| quote=A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a chequing account to pay a cheque, other than a certified cheque, which is presented more than six months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith.}}</ref>\n\n=== Consumer reporting ===\nIn the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as [[ChexSystems]], Early Warning Services, and [[First Data|TeleCheck]] have been providing [[check verification service|cheque verification services]] that track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank can not afford an account to be overdrawn.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tugend |first=Alina |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/24/business/24shortcuts.html?pagewanted=all |title=New York Times |date=2006-06-24 |accessdate=2018-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/16/pf/bank-account-history/index.html?iid=EL|title=Bank customers - you're being tracked|author=Blake Ellis|date=16 August 2012|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/16/pf/CFPB-credit-reporting/index.htm?iid=EL|title=CFPB to supervise credit reporting agencies|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, in common with other items such as [[Direct Debit]]s or [[standing order (banking)|standing orders]], dishonoured cheques can be reported on a customer's credit file, although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst banks. Dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked in the same manner as missed payments on the customer's credit report.\n\n== Lock box ==\n{{Main|Lock box}}\n\nTypically when customers pay bills with cheques (like gas or water bills), the mail will go to a \"[[lock box]]\" at the post office. There a bank will pick up all the mail, sort it, open it, take the cheques and [[remittance advice]] out, process it all through electronic machinery, and post the funds to the proper accounts. In modern systems, taking advantage of the [[Check 21 Act]], as in the US, many cheques are transformed into electronic objects and the paper is destroyed.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n* [[Allonge]] - slip of paper attached to a cheque used to endorse it when there is not enough space.\n* [[Blank cheque]] - cheque where amount has been left blank.\n* [[Certified check|Certified cheque]] - guaranteed by a bank.\n* [[E-check|E-cheque]] - electronic fund transfer.\n* [[Hundi]] - historic Indian cheque like instrument.\n* [[Labour cheque]] - political concept to distribute goods in exchange for work.\n* [[Negotiable cow]] - urban legend where a cow was used as a cheque.\n* [[Remote deposit]] - scanning of cheques and transmitting to the bank electronically.\n* [[Substitute check|Substitute cheque]] - the act of scanning paper cheques and turning them into electronic payments.\n* [[Transit check]] - a cheque which is drawn on another bank than that at which it is presented for payment.\n* [[Traveler's cheque]] - a pre-paid cheque that could be used to make payments in stores.\n* [[Railway pay cheques]] - identification used to collect railway workers pay packet.\n\n== References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{external links|date=February 2013}}\n{{Commons category|lcf=yes}}\n* [https://archive.is/20121223063148/http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/GOLD/thumbs?class_mark=T-S_Ar.30.184 Cheques found in the Cairo Geniza from the 12th century]\n\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Accounting source documents]]\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n[[Category:Banking]]\n[[Category:Numismatics]]\n[[Category:Cheques| ]]\n[[Category:Paper products]]\n", "name_user": "Allegra Geller", "label": "safe", "comment": "More precise definition of a cheque as taught by me in the Bank.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheque"}

Selenium produces a red hue in glass  The molten glass is treated with sodium selenate and then [[arsenic trioxide]] to reduce the compound and provide elemental selenium. Sodium selenate is also used as a decolorizing agent in glass production. The red hue it gives glass is complementary to the green hue given by [[ferrous oxide]]s in the manufacturing process.

Karoland consists of the cooler high lands, and the upper and lower lowlands.\n\nThe Karolands were conquered by the Dutch in 1906, and in 1909 roads to the highlands were constructed, ending the isolation of the highland Karo people. The road linked Medan and the lowlands to Kabanjahe and from there to both [[Kutacane]] in Aceh and [[Pematangsiantar]] in [[Simalungun]].\n\nIn 1911, an agricultural project began at [[Berastagi]], now the major town in Karoland, to grow European vegetables in the cooler temperatures.

These Karo people are divided up into clans or Merga. The Karo Merga are Karo-Karo, Ginting, Sembiring, Perangin-Angin, and Tarigan; these Merga are then divided up into sub-clans and finally families.\n\nIn 13th to 16th century, the Karo people believed has established [[Aru Kingdom]] (also spelled Haru), located in modern day [[Medan]] city and [[Deli Serdang Regency]].

Islam slowly gained influence in coastal area since late 13th century. Despite among the earliest Sumatran kingdom that was exposed to Islam, the people of Aru kingdom remained predominantly pagan, especially those who inhabit interior region. The successor state of Aru Kingdom was the [[Sultanate of Deli]], which demonstrate a mixed influences of Karo, Malay, Tamil and Aceh.\n\nToday, the religion of Karo people are mostly [[Christians|Christian]], a religion brought to Sumatra in the 19th Century by [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]]. However, an increasing number living away from the Karo Highlands have converted to [[Islam]], with the influence of Muslim [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] from neighboring Deli area in Medan, and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] immigrants, thus making the traditional habits of [[pig farming]] and [[cooking]] less common. Some Muslims and Christians however still retain their traditional [[Animist|animist beliefs]] in [[ghosts]], [[spirits]] (perbegu), and [[Traditional medicine|traditional jungle medicine]], despite that fact it contradicts their other beliefs.\n\nKaro people traditionally lived in shared [[longhouses]], but very few now remain, and new construction is exclusively of modern designs.\n\nIt is believed that Karo people may have migrated from the other lands in order to take part in trade with the visiting [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s. This intercourse had an influence on their religious beliefs, as well as ethnic makeup, the [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] 'Sembiring', meaning 'black one', and many Sembiring sub-[[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (Colia, Berahmana, Pandia, Meliala, Depari, Muham, Pelawi and Tekan) are clearly of South-Indian origin, suggesting that inter-marriage between Karo and [[Tamil people]] took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874|title=Deze domeinnaam is via de veiling van DomainOrder.nl geregistreerd|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zijdelings portret van een Karo-priester met een onontwarbare haarvlecht TMnr 10000922.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Karo priest.]]\n\n===Traditional beliefs===\n{{further|Pemena}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe Karo were harassing Dutch interests in East Sumatra, and [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]], a Dutch administrator, regarded [[evangelism]] as a means to suppress this activity. The [[Netherlands Missionary Society]] answered the call, commencing activities in the Karolands in 1890, where they engaged not only in evangelism, but also in [[ethnology]] and documenting the Karo culture. The missionaries attempted to construct a base in [[Kabanjahe]] in the Karo highlands, but were repelled by the suspicious locals.\n\nIn retaliation the Dutch administration waged a war to conquer the Karolands, as part of their final consolidation of power in the [[Indies]]. The Karo [[perceived]] Christianity as the 'Dutch religion', and its followers as 'dark-skinned Dutch'. In this context, the Karo church was initially unsuccessful, and by 1950 the church had only 5,000 members. In the years following [[Indonesian independence]] the perception of Christianity among the Karo as an emblem of [[colonialism]] faded, with the church itself acquiring independence, and adopting more elements of traditional Karo culture such as music (whereas previously the brass band was promoted). By 1965, the Karo church had grown to 35,000 members.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 569-584</ref>\n\n=== After the Indonesian Genocide ===\n\n[[File:Batak Karo Wedding Selendang.jpg|thumb|upright|Karo married couple being bound in a sling (traditionally used in Indonesia for carrying babies), wearing traditional costume including [[ulos]] (Karonese: ''uis'') this action signifies this couple is now united as man and wife.]]\n\nUnlike the Toba Batak, who embraced Christianity fairly readily, the Karo continued to follow their traditional religion for several decades after the arrival of the first Christian missionaries in the Karolands.\n\nFollowing the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u20131966|Indonesian Genocide]] in 1965\u20131966, at which time over 70% of the Karo still followed traditional religions, there was a push for Indonesians to identify with an established religion. Many Karo joined the [[GBKP]] (Batak Karo Protestant church) (60,000 were baptised in 1966\u20131970.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p576</ref>), and from 5,000 Muslims (mostly non-Karo) in Karoland in 1950, there were 30,000 in 1970.\n\nAt this time, the ''Balai Pustaka Adat Merga Si Lima'' (BPAMSL) was established in Berastagi. BPAMSL, proclaimed the 'agama Pemena', or the religion (agama) of the founders ([[Pemena]]).\n\nThe concept of 'religion' was relatively new in the Karoland; historically the neighbouring Muslim people, were known as 'kalak Jawi' or the people of the Jawi lands, and the concept of 'kalak Kristen', or Christian people, was the first time that people were identified by their religion rather than their land. The 'agama Pemena' of BPAMSL was a defence against accusations of atheism, Communism or animism.\n\nBPAMSL conducted a ceremony in the Lau Debuk\u2013Debuk hot spring akin to the one to invest a new Karo village. This ceremony essentially validated the Dutch-established Berastagi as a 'true' Karo village, and was attended by the regent of Karo regency and other political figures.\n\nAt that time, BPAMSL became the largest religious organisation in the Karolands, surpassing the GBKP, and absorbing many who had joined it following the anti-Communist purge.\n\nAs a response to the Pemena movement, the GBKP after 1969 determined that members could participate in village rituals as a matter of [[adat]] (tradition), whereas previously they had been rejected by GBKP as of a religious (unchristian) nature.\n\nAfter [[Golkar]] won the elections in 1972, Djamin Ginting, a leading BPAMSL figure proclaimed BPAMSL as a movement within Golkar, adopting Islam as his religion, while [[Indonesian National Party]] supporters rejected this. With BPAMSL no longer a united force for the practice of Pemena, and Pemena itself no longer a uniting force in the Karoland, and with all Indonesians required to follow one of the religions of Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism, or risk writing 'without belief' on their identity card, the board members of BPAMSL met with a wealthy Indian man from Medan and determined that the traditional religion was in fact an expression of Indian Hinduism, and that it had been founded by a 'Bagavan B\u1e5bgu', from which had been derived the alternate name for the Karo beliefs 'Perbegu' (followers of 'begu' (in Karo, begu is a spirit or ghost)), the existence of Indian-originating Karo [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] names and similarities between Karo ritual and Indian Hindu ones all proving this. Thus the Association of Karo Hinduism (PAHK) was proclaimed.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een verzameling Karo Batak objecten waaronder muziekinstrumenten een mand een zwaard een wichelboek een palmwijnkoker en een aantal doeken TMnr 60011124.jpg|thumb|upright|Musical instruments and other items identified as Karo Batak, photograph (circa 1870) by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe PAHK declared 'Pemena is the same as Hinduism' and received funding from Medan Indians for their cause. PAHK became a movement within [[Parisada Hindu Dharma]] Indonesia, and as a culmination of this, in 1985 PAHK became a branch of the PHDI, PHDK.

The town of Sibolangit, Deli Serdang Regency in the foothills on the road from Medan to Berastagi is also a significant Karo town.\n\nKaroland contains two major volcanoes, [[Mount Sinabung]], which erupted after 400 years of dormancy in 2010, and [[Mount Sibayak]]. Karoland consists of the cooler high lands, and the upper and lower lowlands.\n\nThe Karolands were conquered by the Dutch in 1906, and in 1909 roads to the highlands were constructed, ending the isolation of the highland Karo people. The road linked Medan and the lowlands to Kabanjahe and from there to both [[Kutacane]] in Aceh and [[Pematangsiantar]] in [[Simalungun]].\n\nIn 1911, an agricultural project began at [[Berastagi]], now the major town in Karoland, to grow European vegetables in the cooler temperatures. Berastagi is today the most prosperous part of Karoland, just one hour from Medan, while towns further in the interior suffer from lower incomes and limited access to healthcare.<ref name=karo1 />\n\nThe administrative centre of Karo Regency is [[Kabanjahe]].\n\n==Karo identity==\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over een Karo Batak dorp in de omgeving van het Tobameer TMnr 60011155.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[longhouse]]s at a Karo village near [[Lake Toba]], circa 1870.]]\nThe Karo people speak the Karo language, a language related to, but not mutually intelligible with, other [[Batak languages]], in addition to [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. These Karo people are divided up into clans or Merga. The Karo Merga are Karo-Karo, Ginting, Sembiring, Perangin-Angin, and Tarigan; these Merga are then divided up into sub-clans and finally families.\n\nIn 13th to 16th century, the Karo people believed has established [[Aru Kingdom]] (also spelled Haru), located in modern day [[Medan]] city and [[Deli Serdang Regency]]. It was one of the earliest kingdom in Sumatra.<ref name=\"Archaeology Highlands of Sumatra-Aru\">{{cite book | title = From Distant Tales: Archaeology and Ethnohistory in the Highlands of Sumatra | editor1 = Dominik Bonatz | editor2 = John Miksic| editor3 = J.

Islam slowly gained influence in coastal area since late 13th century. Despite among the earliest Sumatran kingdom that was exposed to Islam, the people of Aru kingdom remained predominantly pagan, especially those who inhabit interior region. The successor state of Aru Kingdom was the [[Sultanate of Deli]], which demonstrate a mixed influences of Karo, Malay, Tamil and Aceh.\n\nToday, the religion of Karo people are mostly [[Christians|Christian]], a religion brought to Sumatra in the 19th Century by [[Christian missionaries|missionaries]]. However, an increasing number living away from the Karo Highlands have converted to [[Islam]], with the influence of Muslim [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] from neighboring Deli area in Medan, and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] immigrants, thus making the traditional habits of [[pig farming]] and [[cooking]] less common. Some Muslims and Christians however still retain their traditional [[Animist|animist beliefs]] in [[ghosts]], [[spirits]] (perbegu), and [[Traditional medicine|traditional jungle medicine]], despite that fact it contradicts their other beliefs.\n\nKaro people traditionally lived in shared [[longhouses]], but very few now remain, and new construction is exclusively of modern designs.\n\nIt is believed that Karo people may have migrated from the other lands in order to take part in trade with the visiting [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s. This intercourse had an influence on their religious beliefs, as well as ethnic makeup, the [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] 'Sembiring', meaning 'black one', and many Sembiring sub-[[Marga (Batak)|marga]] (Colia, Berahmana, Pandia, Meliala, Depari, Muham, Pelawi and Tekan) are clearly of South-Indian origin, suggesting that inter-marriage between Karo and [[Tamil people]] took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3113/3874|title=Deze domeinnaam is via de veiling van DomainOrder.nl geregistreerd|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zijdelings portret van een Karo-priester met een onontwarbare haarvlecht TMnr 10000922.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Karo priest.]]\n\n===Traditional beliefs===\n{{further|Pemena}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe Karo were harassing Dutch interests in East Sumatra, and [[Jacob Theodoor Cremer]], a Dutch administrator, regarded [[evangelism]] as a means to suppress this activity. The [[Netherlands Missionary Society]] answered the call, commencing activities in the Karolands in 1890, where they engaged not only in evangelism, but also in [[ethnology]] and documenting the Karo culture. The missionaries attempted to construct a base in [[Kabanjahe]] in the Karo highlands, but were repelled by the suspicious locals.\n\nIn retaliation the Dutch administration waged a war to conquer the Karolands, as part of their final consolidation of power in the [[Indies]]. The Karo [[perceived]] Christianity as the 'Dutch religion', and its followers as 'dark-skinned Dutch'. In this context, the Karo church was initially unsuccessful, and by 1950 the church had only 5,000 members. In the years following [[Indonesian independence]] the perception of Christianity among the Karo as an emblem of [[colonialism]] faded, with the church itself acquiring independence, and adopting more elements of traditional Karo culture such as music (whereas previously the brass band was promoted). By 1965, the Karo church had grown to 35,000 members.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia. pp. 569-584</ref>\n\n=== After the Indonesian Genocide ===\n\n[[File:Batak Karo Wedding Selendang.jpg|thumb|upright|Karo married couple being bound in a sling (traditionally used in Indonesia for carrying babies), wearing traditional costume including [[ulos]] (Karonese: ''uis'') this action signifies this couple is now united as man and wife.]]\n\nUnlike the Toba Batak, who embraced Christianity fairly readily, the Karo continued to follow their traditional religion for several decades after the arrival of the first Christian missionaries in the Karolands.\n\nFollowing the [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u20131966|Indonesian Genocide]] in 1965\u20131966, at which time over 70% of the Karo still followed traditional religions, there was a push for Indonesians to identify with an established religion. Many Karo joined the [[GBKP]] (Batak Karo Protestant church) (60,000 were baptised in 1966\u20131970.<ref>History of Christianity in Indonesia p576</ref>), and from 5,000 Muslims (mostly non-Karo) in Karoland in 1950, there were 30,000 in 1970.\n\nAt this time, the ''Balai Pustaka Adat Merga Si Lima'' (BPAMSL) was established in Berastagi. BPAMSL, proclaimed the 'agama Pemena', or the religion (agama) of the founders ([[Pemena]]).\n\nThe concept of 'religion' was relatively new in the Karoland; historically the neighbouring Muslim people, were known as 'kalak Jawi' or the people of the Jawi lands, and the concept of 'kalak Kristen', or Christian people, was the first time that people were identified by their religion rather than their land. The 'agama Pemena' of BPAMSL was a defence against accusations of atheism, Communism or animism.\n\nBPAMSL conducted a ceremony in the Lau Debuk\u2013Debuk hot spring akin to the one to invest a new Karo village. This ceremony essentially validated the Dutch-established Berastagi as a 'true' Karo village, and was attended by the regent of Karo regency and other political figures.\n\nAt that time, BPAMSL became the largest religious organisation in the Karolands, surpassing the GBKP, and absorbing many who had joined it following the anti-Communist purge.\n\nAs a response to the Pemena movement, the GBKP after 1969 determined that members could participate in village rituals as a matter of [[adat]] (tradition), whereas previously they had been rejected by GBKP as of a religious (unchristian) nature.\n\nAfter [[Golkar]] won the elections in 1972, Djamin Ginting, a leading BPAMSL figure proclaimed BPAMSL as a movement within Golkar, adopting Islam as his religion, while [[Indonesian National Party]] supporters rejected this. With BPAMSL no longer a united force for the practice of Pemena, and Pemena itself no longer a uniting force in the Karoland, and with all Indonesians required to follow one of the religions of Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism, or risk writing 'without belief' on their identity card, the board members of BPAMSL met with a wealthy Indian man from Medan and determined that the traditional religion was in fact an expression of Indian Hinduism, and that it had been founded by a 'Bagavan B\u1e5bgu', from which had been derived the alternate name for the Karo beliefs 'Perbegu' (followers of 'begu' (in Karo, begu is a spirit or ghost)), the existence of Indian-originating Karo [[Marga (Batak)|marga]] names and similarities between Karo ritual and Indian Hindu ones all proving this. Thus the Association of Karo Hinduism (PAHK) was proclaimed.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een verzameling Karo Batak objecten waaronder muziekinstrumenten een mand een zwaard een wichelboek een palmwijnkoker en een aantal doeken TMnr 60011124.jpg|thumb|upright|Musical instruments and other items identified as Karo Batak, photograph (circa 1870) by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe PAHK declared 'Pemena is the same as Hinduism' and received funding from Medan Indians for their cause. PAHK became a movement within [[Parisada Hindu Dharma]] Indonesia, and as a culmination of this, in 1985 PAHK became a branch of the PHDI, PHDK. When Parisada Hindu Dharma Karo (PHDK) was established, it claimed 50,000 members, and 50,000 more sympathisers. The PHD built a Balinese-style temple in Tanjung, a Karo village to inaugurate the PHDK. In doing so it was stated that PHDI (i.e. Balinese) Hinduism was the only valid form, and in fact the Karo 'Hindu' ritual were invalid, the name change from 'Hindu Karo' to 'Hindu Dharma Karo' and the replacement of Tamil Indians on the PAHK board with Balinese on the PHDK symbolising the assertion of 'Hindu Dharma' as the 'valid' Hindu religion, with little regard paid to re-imagining Karo rituals within an Agama Hindu context.\n\nThere was an immediate decline in PAHK/PHDK support, with a small number of people still following the PHDK practices, but others following traditional Karo (Pemena) rituals outside of the formal context of PHDK. This left the Christian GBKP, by then for many years an indigenous Karo-run adat-respecting church a rather more comfortable option for most Karo than the Balinese Hinduism asserted by PHDK.

As retrotransposon integration patterns vary between genotypes, the number and size of the resulting amplicons can be used for differentiation of genotypes or cultivars, to measure genetic diversity or to reconstruct phylogenies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalendar R, Grob T, Regina M, Suomeni A, Schulman A |title=IRAP and REMAP: two new retrotransposon-based DNA fingerprinting techniques |journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=704\u2013711 |date=April 1999 |doi=10.1007/s001220051124 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Flavell AJ, Knox MR, Pearce SR, Ellis TH |title=Retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphisms (RBIP) for high throughput marker analysis |journal=Plant J. |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=643\u201350 |date=December 1998 |pmid=10036780 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-313x.1998.00334.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kumar A, Hirochika H |title=Applications of retrotransposons as genetic tools in plant biology |journal=Trends Plant Sci. |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=127\u201334 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11239612 |doi=10.1016/s1360-1385(00)01860-4}}</ref> SINEs, which are small in size and often integrate within or next to genes represent an optimal source for the generation of effective IRAP markers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seibt|first1=KM|last2=Wenke|first2=T|last3=Wollrab|first3=C|last4=Junghans|first4=H|last5=Muders|first5=K|last6=Dehmer|first6=KJ|last7=Diekmann|first7=K|last8=Schmidt|first8=T|title=Development and application of SINE-based markers for genotyping of potato varieties.|journal=TAG.
