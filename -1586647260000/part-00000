There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''.

The original theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644. The modern Globe Theatre is an academic approximation based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings. It is considered quite realistic, though modern safety requirements mean that it accommodates only 1,400 spectators compared to the original theatre's 3,000.<ref>Mulryne, J. R. Shewing, Margaret.

The site also includes the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], an indoor theatre which opened in January 2014. This is a smaller, candle-lit space based on the indoor playhouses of Jacobean London. The Sackler Studios, an educational and rehearsal studio complex, is situated just around the corner from the main site.\n\n[[Michelle Terry]] currently serves as Artistic Director. She is the second actor-manager in charge of the organisation, following [[Mark Rylance]], the founding Artistic Director.\n\n==Planning and construction==\nIn 1970, American actor and director [[Sam Wanamaker]] founded the Shakespeare Globe Trust and the International Shakespeare Globe Centre, with the objective of building a faithful recreation of Shakespeare's Globe close to its original location at [[Bankside]], Southwark. This inspired the founding of a number of [[Shakespeare's Globe Centres]] around the world, an activity in which Wanamaker also participated.\n[[File:The Globe Theatre, Panorama Innenraum, London.jpg|thumb|upright=2|left|Stage and galleries]]\nMany people maintained that a faithful Globe reconstruction was impossible to achieve due to the complications in the 16th century design and modern fire safety requirements; however, Wanamaker persevered in his vision for over twenty years, and a new Globe theatre was eventually built according to a design based on the research of historical adviser [[John Orrell]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Martin | first =Douglas | title =John Orrell, 68, Historian on New Globe Theater, Dies | work =[[New York Times]] | date =30 October 2008 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6133DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/D/Deaths%20(Obituaries) | accessdate =11 December 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080118210341/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6133DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FD%2FDeaths%20%28Obituaries%29 | archivedate =30 October 2008 | df =dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was Wanamaker's wish that the new building recreate the Globe as it existed during most of Shakespeare's time there; that is, the 1599 building rather than its 1614 replacement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gurr|first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Gurr |editor=Mulryne, J.

In addition, listed Georgian townhouses now occupy part of the original site and could not be considered for removal. Like the original Globe, the modern theatre has a [[thrust stage]] that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by three tiers of raked seating. The only covered parts of the amphitheatre are the stage and the seating areas. Plays are staged during the summer, usually between May and the first week of October; in the winter, the theatre is used for educational purposes. Tours are available all year round.  Some productions are filmed and released to cinemas as Globe on Screen productions (usually in the year following the live production), and on DVD.\n\nThe reconstruction was carefully researched so that the new building would be as faithful a replica of the original as possible. This was aided by the discovery of the remains of the original [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], a nearby neighbour to the Globe, as final plans were being made for the site and structure.\n\nThe building itself is constructed entirely of [[Quercus robur|English oak]], with [[mortise and tenon]] joints<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> and is, in this sense, an \"authentic\" 16th century timber-framed building, as no structural steel was used. The seats are simple benches (though cushions can be hired for performances) and the Globe has the first and only [[thatched roof]] permitted in London since the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]].<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> The modern thatch is well protected by fire retardants, and [[fire sprinkler system|sprinklers]] on the roof ensure further protection against fire. The pit has a concrete surface,<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> as opposed to earthen-ground covered with strewn rush from the original theatre. The theatre has extensive backstage support areas for actors and musicians, and is attached to a modern lobby, restaurant, gift shop and visitor centre. Seating capacity is 873<ref>This number can be derived by counting all seats on the detailed seating plans that are shown after selecting an event and start the booking procedure at {{cite web | title=Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London | work=online | publisher=Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London | year=2009 | url=https://tickets.shakespeares-globe.org/ | accessdate=29 November 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235618/http://tickets.shakespeares-globe.org/ | archivedate=25 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }} and adding another 20 for the \"Gentlemen's Rooms\" ({{cite web\n |title      = Shakespeare's Globe\n |work       = Gentlemen's Rooms\n |publisher  = Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London\n |year       = 2009\n |url        = http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/theatre/hospitality/\n |accessdate = 29 November 2009\n}})</ref> with an additional 700 \"[[Groundling]]s\" standing in the yard,<ref>{{cite web\n | title =Shakespeare's Globe :: Seating Plan and Ticket Prices\n | publisher =Shakespeare's Globe | year =2009\n | url =http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/theatre/boxoffice/seatingplanandticketprices/\n | accessdate =2 August 2009 }}</ref> making up an audience about half the size of a typical audience in Shakespeare's time.\n\nFor its first eighteen seasons, performances were engineered to duplicate the original environment of Shakespeare's Globe; there were no spotlights, and plays were staged during daylight hours and in the evenings (with the help of interior floodlights), there were no microphones, speakers or amplification. All music was performed live, most often on period instruments; and the actors and the audience could see and interact easily with each other, adding to the feeling of a shared experience and of a community event.\n\nTypically, performances have been created in the spirit of experimentation to explore the original playing conditions of the 1599 Globe. Modern, conventional theatre technology such as spotlights and microphones were not used during this period. Beginning in the 2016 season, the new Artistic Director, Emma Rice, began experimenting with the theatre space by installing a temporary lighting and sound rig. The current Artistic Director, Michelle Terry, has brought back the experimentation on original playing conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6d193852-1369-11e9-a168-d45595ad076d|title=Globe director Michelle Terry on untapped potential in Shakespeare\u2019s great plays|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Globe operates without any public subsidy and generates \u00a324 million in revenue per year.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://cdn.shakespearesglobe.com/uploads/2019/05/Annual-Review-2018.pdf|title=Annual Review 2018|work=Shakespeare's Globe|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Sam Wanamaker Playhouse==\n{{main|Sam Wanamaker Playhouse}}\nAdjacent to the Globe is the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], an indoor theatre modelled after a Jacobean-era theatre and used for performances during the winter months when the main theatre cannot be used.\n\n==''Read Not Dead''==\n''Read Not Dead''  is a series of play readings, or staged \u201cperformances with scripts\u201d that have been presented as part of the educational programme of Shakespeare's Globe since 1995.

The original theatre was built in 1599, destroyed by fire in 1613, rebuilt in 1614, and then demolished in 1644. The modern Globe Theatre is an academic approximation based on available evidence of the 1599 and 1614 buildings.

The site also includes the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], an indoor theatre which opened in January 2014. This is a smaller, candle-lit space based on the indoor playhouses of Jacobean London. The Sackler Studios, an educational and rehearsal studio complex, is situated just around the corner from the main site.\n\n[[Michelle Terry]] currently serves as Artistic Director. She is the second actor-manager in charge of the organisation, following [[Mark Rylance]], the founding Artistic Director.\n\n==Planning and construction==\nIn 1970, American actor and director [[Sam Wanamaker]] founded the Shakespeare Globe Trust and the International Shakespeare Globe Centre, with the objective of building a faithful recreation of Shakespeare's Globe close to its original location at [[Bankside]], Southwark. This inspired the founding of a number of [[Shakespeare's Globe Centres]] around the world, an activity in which Wanamaker also participated.\n[[File:The Globe Theatre, Panorama Innenraum, London.jpg|thumb|upright=2|left|Stage and galleries]]\nMany people maintained that a faithful Globe reconstruction was impossible to achieve due to the complications in the 16th century design and modern fire safety requirements; however, Wanamaker persevered in his vision for over twenty years, and a new Globe theatre was eventually built according to a design based on the research of historical adviser [[John Orrell]].<ref>{{cite news | last =Martin | first =Douglas | title =John Orrell, 68, Historian on New Globe Theater, Dies | work =[[New York Times]] | date =30 October 2008 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6133DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/D/Deaths%20(Obituaries) | accessdate =11 December 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080118210341/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD6133DF93BA1575AC0A9659C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FD%2FDeaths%20%28Obituaries%29 | archivedate =30 October 2008 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> *<:0)\n\nIt was Wanamaker's wish that the new building recreate the Globe as it existed during most of Shakespeare's time there; that is, the 1599 building rather than its 1614 replacement.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gurr|first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Gurr |editor=Mulryne, J.

In addition, listed Georgian townhouses now occupy part of the original site and could not be considered for removal. Like the original Globe, the modern theatre has a [[thrust stage]] that projects into a large circular yard surrounded by three tiers of raked seating. The only covered parts of the amphitheatre are the stage and the seating areas. Plays are staged during the summer, usually between May and the first week of October; in the winter, the theatre is used for educational purposes. Tours are available all year round.  Some productions are filmed and released to cinemas as Globe on Screen productions (usually in the year following the live production), and on DVD.\n\nThe reconstruction was carefully researched so that the new building would be as faithful a replica of the original as possible. This was aided by the discovery of the remains of the original [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]], a nearby neighbour to the Globe, as final plans were being made for the site and structure.\n\nThe building itself is constructed entirely of [[Quercus robur|English oak]], with [[mortise and tenon]] joints<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> and is, in this sense, an \"authentic\" 16th century timber-framed building, as no structural steel was used. The seats are simple benches (though cushions can be hired for performances) and the Globe has the first and only [[thatched roof]] permitted in London since the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire of 1666]].<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> The modern thatch is well protected by fire retardants, and [[fire sprinkler system|sprinklers]] on the roof ensure further protection against fire. The pit has a concrete surface,<ref name=\"PMcC\"/> as opposed to earthen-ground covered with strewn rush from the original theatre. The theatre has extensive backstage support areas for actors and musicians, and is attached to a modern lobby, restaurant, gift shop and visitor centre. Seating capacity is 873<ref>This number can be derived by counting all seats on the detailed seating plans that are shown after selecting an event and start the booking procedure at {{cite web | title=Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London | work=online | publisher=Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London | year=2009 | url=https://tickets.shakespeares-globe.org/ | accessdate=29 November 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025235618/http://tickets.shakespeares-globe.org/ | archivedate=25 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }} and adding another 20 for the \"Gentlemen's Rooms\" ({{cite web\n |title      = Shakespeare's Globe\n |work       = Gentlemen's Rooms\n |publisher  = Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London\n |year       = 2009\n |url        = http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/theatre/hospitality/\n |accessdate = 29 November 2009\n}})</ref> with an additional 700 \"[[Groundling]]s\" standing in the yard,<ref>{{cite web\n | title =Shakespeare's Globe :: Seating Plan and Ticket Prices\n | publisher =Shakespeare's Globe | year =2009\n | url =http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/theatre/boxoffice/seatingplanandticketprices/\n | accessdate =2 August 2009 }}</ref> making up an audience about half the size of a typical audience in Shakespeare's time.\n\nFor its first eighteen seasons, performances were engineered to duplicate the original environment of Shakespeare's Globe; there were no spotlights, and plays were staged during daylight hours and in the evenings (with the help of interior floodlights), there were no microphones, speakers or amplification. All music was performed live, most often on period instruments; and the actors and the audience could see and interact easily with each other, adding to the feeling of a shared experience and of a community event.\n\nTypically, performances have been created in the spirit of experimentation to explore the original playing conditions of the 1599 Globe. Modern, conventional theatre technology such as spotlights and microphones were not used during this period. Beginning in the 2016 season, the new Artistic Director, Emma Rice, began experimenting with the theatre space by installing a temporary lighting and sound rig. The current Artistic Director, Michelle Terry, has brought back the experimentation on original playing conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/6d193852-1369-11e9-a168-d45595ad076d|title=Globe director Michelle Terry on untapped potential in Shakespeare\u2019s great plays|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref>\n\nThe Globe operates without any public subsidy and generates \u00a324 million in revenue per year.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web|url=https://cdn.shakespearesglobe.com/uploads/2019/05/Annual-Review-2018.pdf|title=Annual Review 2018|work=Shakespeare's Globe|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Sam Wanamaker Playhouse==\n{{main|Sam Wanamaker Playhouse}}\nAdjacent to the Globe is the [[Sam Wanamaker Playhouse]], an indoor theatre modelled after a Jacobean-era theatre and used for performances during the winter months when the main theatre cannot be used.\n\n==''Read Not Dead''==\n''Read Not Dead''  is a series of play readings, or staged \u201cperformances with scripts\u201d that have been presented as part of the educational programme of Shakespeare's Globe since 1995.

She wore the brand and the crown of [[Miss Ecuador]] for the very first time. The contest was inactive for more than 20 years until 1955 when Leonor Carcache won the first modern title of Miss Ecuador, and became the first representative of the country to the [[Miss Universe 1955|Miss Universe]] pageant.\n\nRepresentatives from the all 24 provinces that make up Ecuador compete annually for the title of Miss Ecuador among others. In addition to representatives to [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss International]]; Miss Ecuador Organization also selects the candidates for Miss United Continents and [[Reina Hispanoamericana]], under the direction of Mrs. Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Aguayo. Mr. Juli\u00e1n Pico has the rights to choose and send a contestant to [[Miss World]], Miss Supranational and Miss Grand through the national pageant [[Miss World Ecuador]] since [[Miss World Ecuador 2013|2013]] under the direction of Mrs. Tah\u00edz Panus. The representatives for [[Miss Earth]] and [[Miss Latin America]] are selected by Ms. [[Katherine Esp\u00edn]] and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Hidalgo respectively. Mrs. Cecilia Niemes has the rights to send a delegate to Miss Atl\u00e1ntico Internacional.\n\n[[File:Miss Ecuador winners in Map 2017.png|thumbnail|Miss Ecuador winners by Province]]\n\n==Miss

She wore the brand and the crown of [[Miss Ecuador]] for the very first time. The contest was inactive for more than 20 years until 1955 when Leonor Carcache won the first modern title of Miss Ecuador, and became the first representative of the country to the [[Miss Universe 1955|Miss Universe]] pageant.\n\nRepresentatives from the all 24 provinces that make up Ecuador compete annually for the title of Miss Ecuador among others. In addition to representatives to [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss International]]; Miss Ecuador Organization also selects the candidates for Miss United Continents and [[Reina Hispanoamericana]], under the direction of Mrs. Mar\u00eda del Carmen de Aguayo. Mr. Juli\u00e1n Pico has the rights to choose and send a contestant to [[Miss World]], Miss Supranational and Miss Grand through the national pageant [[Miss World Ecuador]] since [[Miss World Ecuador 2013|2013]] under the direction of Mrs. Tah\u00edz Panus. The representatives for [[Miss Earth]] and [[Miss Latin America]] are selected by Ms. [[Katherine Esp\u00edn]] and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Hidalgo respectively.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (although Prine himself credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-prine-roger-ebert-first-review/|title=How an Unplanned Roger Ebert Review Launched John Prine's Career|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>), resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]]. He was born and raised in the Maywood suburb of Chicago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|title=John Prine Endures, With a Half-Smile and a Song|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 30, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330175317/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|archive-date=March 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zcAvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22William+Mason+Prine%22&source=bl&ots=jDOm_3v6oV&sig=ACfU3U35TPsyQSJTsNvdrVEMe6ixKUIQpQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjkg93TiNjoAhUMmuAKHXncA00Q6AEwA3oECAkQAQ|title=John Prine: In Spite of Himself|first=Eddie|last=Huffman|date=March 15, 2015|page=76|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|via=Google Books}}</ref> In summers, they would go back to visit family near [[Paradise, Kentucky]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://studsterkel.wfmt.com/programs/john-prine-discusses-his-life-and-his-formation-music-0 |title=John Prine discusses his life and his formation in music |date=1975 |work=Studs Terkel Radio Archive |access-date=2020-04-11 |publisher=WFMT and Chicago History Museum |language=en}}</ref> Prine started playing guitar at age 14, taught by his brother, David.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |title=John Prine Information |website=Shrout.co.uk |date=October 10, 1946 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006062927/http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/98957222421345075 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> and [[Proviso East High School|Proviso Township High School]] (later called Proviso East) in [[Maywood, Illinois]].

Highlights include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]]\", which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs\", which Prine later recorded with Goodman.<ref>{{cite web |title=Looking Back on John Prine Buddy Steve Goodman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/looking-back-on-john-prine-buddy-steve-goodman-860284/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |publisher=Rollingstone |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent albums include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby\", \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter\", and \"Christmas in Prison\", and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\". The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. 1978's ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' was a Steve Goodman-produced album that gave listeners songs such as \"That's The Way That The World Goes 'Round\", \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone\", \"Fish and Whistle\", and the title track.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cocks |first1=Jay |title=Bruised Orange |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/bruised-orange-190100/ |website=www.rollingstone.com |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman.

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he returned to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (although Prine himself credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-prine-roger-ebert-first-review/|title=How an Unplanned Roger Ebert Review Launched John Prine's Career|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>), resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

The Italian invasion in October 1940, which is usually known as the [[Greco-Italian War]], was followed by the German invasion in April 1941. [[Battle of Crete|German landings on the island of Crete]] (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece. These battles were part of the greater [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] of Germany.\n\nFollowing the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940, Greece repelled the initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, the bulk of the [[Hellenic army|Greek Army]] was on the Greek border with [[Albania under Italy|Albania]], then a vassal of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] invaded from [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]], creating a second front. Greece received a small reinforcement from [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] forces in anticipation of the German attack. The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the [[Metaxas Line|Metaxas defensive line]] did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans, who then outflanked the Greek forces at the Albanian border, forcing their surrender. British, Australian and New Zealand forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat, with the ultimate goal of evacuation. For several days, Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the [[Thermopylae]] position, allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece.{{sfn|Johnston|2013|p=18}} The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] reached the capital, [[Athens]], on 27 April{{Cref |a}} and Greece's southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British, Australian and New Zealand personnel and ending the battle with a decisive victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its fall, Greece was occupied by the military forces of Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=102\u20136}}\n\n[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] later blamed the failure of his [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], which had to be delayed, on [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s failed conquest of Greece.{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|p=178}}Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attach\u00e9 in Rome, emphasises, from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking [[Malta]].{{sfn|von Rintelen|1951|pp=90, 92\u20133, 98\u20139}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Greco-Italian War===\n{{details |Greco-Italian War}}\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]\u2014the [[Metaxism|fascist-style]] [[dictator]] of Greece and former [[general]]\u2014sought to maintain a position of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].

To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Eastern Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]], because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border.

Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion, the British troops that were sent as defensive aid created the possibility of a frontier to the German southern flank. Hitler's principal fear was that British aircraft based in Greece would bomb the Romanian oil fields, which was one of Germany's most important sources of oil.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As Hitler was already seriously considering launching an invasion of the Soviet Union the next year, this increased the importance of Romanian oil as once Germany was at war with the Soviet Union, Romania would be the ''Reich'''s only source of oil, at least until the Wehrmacht presumably captured the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As the British were indeed contemplating using the Greek air fields to bomb the Romanian oil fields, Hitler's fears that his entire war machine might be paralyzed for a lack of oil should the Ploie\u0219ti oil fields be destroyed were to a certain extent grounded in reality.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} However, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg noted: \"...the enormous difficulties of air attacks on distant oil fields were not understood by either side at this time; it was assumed on both sides that even small air raids could bring about vast fire and destruction\".{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} Furthermore, the massive Italian defeats in the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and North Africa had pushed the Fascist regime in Italy to the brink of collapse by late 1940 with Mussolini becoming extremely unpopular with the Italian people, and Hitler was convinced that if he did not rescue Mussolini, Fascist Italy would be knocked out of the war in 1941.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} Weinberg wrote the continuing Italian defeats \"....could easily lead to the complete collapse of the whole system Mussolini had established, and this was recognized at the time; it is not hindsight from 1943\".{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} If Italy was knocked out of the war, then the British would be able to use the central Mediterranean again, and the governors of the French colonies in Africa loyal to the Vichy regime might switch their loyalties to the Free French National Committee headed by Charles de Gaulle.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As Hitler had plans to ultimately use the French colonies in Africa as bases for the war against Britain, the potential loss of Vichy control over its Africa empire was seen as a problem by him.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|2008|pp=183\u2013186}}\n\nFurthermore, after Italy entered the war in June 1940, the danger of Axis air and naval attacks had largely closed the central Mediterranean to British shipping except for [[Malta convoys|supply convoys]] to Malta, in effect closing the Suez canal as the British were forced to supply their forces in Egypt via the long Cape route around Africa.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=211\u2013214}} The British had made liberating Italian East Africa a priority to end the possibility of Italian naval and air attacks on British shipping on the Red Sea, which assumed greater importance because of the dangers posed to British shipping in the central Mediterranean.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=211}} In turn, the decision by Field Marshal [[Archibald Wavell]] to deploy significant forces to the Horn of Africa while as defending Egypt lessened the number of Commonwealth forces available to go to Greece.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|pp=98\u2013108}} Through the performance of the Italian armed forces had been less than impressive, from the German perspective denying the British access to the central Mediterranean by stationing Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Italy made it crucial to keep Italy in the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=213\u2013214}} Hitler ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in Romania and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases.{{Sfn | Blau| 1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 5\u20137]}}<ref name = \"H\" />\n\nOn 12 November, the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Armed Forces High Command]] issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against [[Gibraltar]] and Greece for the following January. On 17 November 1940, Metaxas proposed a joint offensive in the Balkans to the British government, with Greek strongholds in southern Albania as the operational base. The British were reluctant to discuss Metaxas' proposal, because the troops necessary for implementing the Greek plan would seriously endanger operations in North Africa.{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1997|pp =285, 288}} In December 1940, German ambitions in the Mediterranean underwent considerable revision when Spain's General [[Francisco Franco]] rejected the Gibraltar attack.{{sfn| Keitel | 1979 | pp = 154\u201355}} Consequently, Germany's offensive in southern Europe was restricted to the Greek campaign. The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on 13 December 1940, outlining the Greek campaign under the code designation Operation Marita.

Two invasion courses were located west of [[Kyustendil]]; another was along the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border, via the Struma river valley to the south. Greek border fortifications had been adapted for the terrain and a formidable defence system covered the few available roads. The Struma and [[Nestos River|Nestos]] rivers cut across the mountain range along the Greek-Bulgarian frontier and both of their valleys were protected by strong fortifications, as part of the larger [[Metaxas Line]]. This system of concrete [[pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] and field fortifications, constructed along the Bulgarian border in the late 1930s, was built on principles similar to those of the [[Maginot Line]]. Its strength resided mainly in the inaccessibility of the intermediate terrain leading up to the defence positions.{{sfn|Bailey|1979|p=37}}{{sfn|Blau|1986|p=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 75]}}\n\n===Strategy===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at a conference in Quebec - NARA - 197119.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill believed it was vital for Britain to take every measure possible to support Greece.

Air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many [[defile (geography)|defiles]]. Although an invading force from [[Albania]] could be stopped by a relatively small number of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | p = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 77]}}\n\nFollowing a March conference in Athens, the British believed that they would combine with Greek forces to occupy the [[Haliacmon]] Line\u2014a short front facing north-eastwards along the [[Vermio Mountains]] and the lower [[Haliacmon]] river. Papagos awaited clarification from the Yugoslav government and later proposed to hold the [[Metaxas Line]]\u2014by then a symbol of national security to the Greek populace\u2014and not withdraw divisions from Albania.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|pp= [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-11.html 106\u20137]}}{{Sfn | Papagos |1949|p=115}}{{Sfn |Ziemke}}  He argued that to do so would be seen as a concession to the Italians.

Instead, he took a position some {{convert|40|miles|km| abbr = off}} west of the Axios, across the Haliacmon Line.{{Sfn | Svolopoulos | 1997 | p=290}}{{Sfn | Ziemke}}  The two main objectives in establishing this position were to maintain contact with the Hellenic army in Albania and to deny German access to Central Greece. This had the advantage of requiring a smaller force than other options, while allowing more preparation time, but it meant abandoning nearly the whole of Northern Greece, which was unacceptable to the Greeks for political and psychological reasons. The line's left flank was susceptible to flanking from Germans operating through the [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] Gap in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Buckley|1984|pp=40\u201345}} The rapid disintegration of the Yugoslav Army and a German thrust into the rear of the [[Vermio, Kozani|Vermion]] position was not expected.{{Sfn |Blau| 1986 | p = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 77]}}\n\nThe German strategy was based on using so-called \"''[[blitzkrieg]]''\" methods that had proved successful during the invasions of Western Europe. Their effectiveness was confirmed during the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. The German command again coupled ground troops and armour with air support and rapidly drove into the territory. Once Thessaloniki was captured, Athens and the port of [[Piraeus]] became principal targets. Piraeus, was virtually destroyed by bombing on the night of the 6/7 April.<ref>[http://ww2today.com/7th-april-1941-disaster-in-piraeus-harbour Disaster in Piraeus Harbour]</ref> The loss of Piraeus and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] would fatally compromise withdrawal and evacuation of British and Greek forces.{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | p = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 77]}}\n\n===Defence and attack forces===\n{{further|Order of battle for the Battle of Greece}}\n[[File:BlameyWilsonFreyberg.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], commander of [[I Corps (Australia)|Australian I Corps]], Lieutenant General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, commanding general of the Empire expeditionary force ('W' Force) and Major General [[Bernard Freyberg]], commander of the New Zealand 2nd Division, in 1941 in Greece]]\nThe Fifth Yugoslav Army took responsibility for the south-eastern border between [[Kriva Palanka]] and the Greek border. The Yugoslav troops were not fully mobilised and lacked adequate equipment and weapons. Following the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, the majority of Greek troops were evacuated from [[Western Thrace]]. By this time, Greek forces defending the Bulgarian border totalled roughly 70,000 men (sometimes labelled the \"Greek Second Army\" in English and German sources, although no such formation existed). The remainder of the Greek forces\u201414 divisions (often erroneously referred to as the \"Greek First Army\" by foreign sources)\u2014was committed in Albania.{{sfn|Blau|1986|p=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79]}}\n\nOn 28 March, the Greek [[Central Macedonia Army Section]]\u2014comprising the [[12th Infantry Division (Greece)|12th]] and [[20th Infantry Division (Greece)|20th]] Infantry Divisions\u2014were put under the command of General Wilson, who established his headquarters to the north-west of [[Larissa]]. The New Zealand division took position north of [[Mount Olympus]], while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece, but few planes could be diverted to the theatre. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the [[Aegean Sea]]. These [[Logistics|logistical]] problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.{{sfn|Blau|1986|pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79\u201380]}}\n\nThe [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Twelfth Army]]\u2014under the command of [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm List]]\u2014was charged with the execution of Operation Marita.

Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.{{sfn|Blau|1986|pp=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82\u201383]}}\n\nThe Yugoslav ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' led to a sudden change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via [[Ni\u0161]] toward [[Belgrade]]. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.{{sfn|Blau|1986|pp=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 83\u201384]}}\n\n==German invasion==\n\n===Thrust across southern Yugoslavia and the drive to Thessaloniki===\n{{See also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Battle of Greece - 9 April 1941.png|thumb|German advance until 9 April 1941, when the 2nd Panzer Division seized Thessaloniki]]\nAt dawn on 6 April, the German armies invaded Greece, while the [[Luftwaffe]] began an intensive bombardment of [[Belgrade]].

The British came very near to holding Crete and perhaps other islands that would have provided air support for naval operations throughout the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIn enumerating the reasons for the complete Axis victory in Greece, the following factors were of greatest significance:\n* German superiority in ground forces and equipment;{{Sfn | Blau| 1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}}{{Sfn |McClymont|1959 | pp = [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471\u201372]}}\n* The bulk of the Greek army was occupied fighting the Italians on the Albanian front.\n* German air supremacy combined with the inability of the Greeks to provide the RAF with adequate airfields;{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}}\n* Inadequacy of British expeditionary forces, since the Imperial force available was small;{{Sfn |McClymont | 1959 | pp = [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471\u201372]}}\n* Poor condition of the Hellenic Army and its shortages of modern equipment;{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}}\n* Inadequate port, road and railway facilities;{{Sfn |McClymont|1959 | pp = [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-1.html 471\u201372]}}\n* Absence of a unified command and lack of cooperation between the British, Greek and Yugoslav forces;{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}}\n* Turkey's strict neutrality;{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}} and\n* The early collapse of Yugoslav resistance.{{Sfn |Blau|1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 116\u201318]}}\n\n===Criticism of British actions===\nAfter the Allies' defeat, the decision to send British forces into Greece faced fierce criticism in Britain. Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] during World War II, considered intervention in Greece to be \"a definite strategic blunder\", as it denied Wavell the necessary reserves to complete the conquest of [[Italian Libya]], or to withstand [[Erwin Rommel]]'s ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' March offensive. It prolonged the [[North African Campaign]], which might have been concluded during 1941.{{sfn|Broad|1958|p= 113}}\n\nIn 1947, [[Freddie de Guingand|de Guingand]] asked the British government to recognise its mistaken strategy in Greece.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=624}} Buckley countered that if Britain had not honoured its 1939 commitment to Greece, it would have severely damaged the ethical basis of its struggle against Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Buckley | 1984 |p=138}} According to Heinz Richter, Churchill tried through the campaign in Greece, to influence the political atmosphere in the United States and insisted on this strategy even after the defeat.{{sfn | Richter |1998|p=633}} According to Keegan, \"the Greek campaign had been an old-fashioned gentlemen's war, with honor given and accepted by brave adversaries on each side\" and the vastly outnumbered Greek and Allied forces, \"had, rightly, the sensation of having fought the good fight\".{{sfn|Keegan|2005|p=158}}  It has also been suggested the British strategy was to create a barrier in Greece, to protect [[Turkey]], the only (neutral) country standing between an Axis block in the Balkans and the oil-rich [[Middle East]] but the British intervention in Greece was considered a fiasco.{{sfn|Lawlor|1982|pp=936, 945}}{{sfn|Stahel|2012|p=14}} Martin van Creveld believes that the British did everything in their power to scuttle all attempts at a separate peace between the Greeks and the Italians, to keep the Greeks fighting so as to draw Italian divisions away from North Africa.{{sfn|van Creveld|1974|p= 91}}\n\nFreyberg and Blamey also had serious doubts about the feasibility of the operation but failed to express their reservations and apprehensions.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|pp= [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 475\u201376]}} The campaign caused a furore in Australia, when it became known that when General Blamey received his first warning of the move to Greece on 18 February 1941, he was worried but had not informed the Australian Government. He had been told by Wavell that [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] Menzies had approved the plan.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|p = [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]}} The proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=338}} On 5 March, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that \"the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe\" and the next day he called the operation \"most hazardous\". Thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|pp = [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-13.html 115], [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]}}\n\n===Impact on Operation Barbarossa===\nIn 1942, members of the [[British Parliament]] characterised the campaign in Greece as a \"political and sentimental decision\". Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp = 638\u201339}} This is an argument that historians used to assert that Greek resistance was a turning point in World War II.{{Sfn | Eggenberger |1985| loc =Greece (World War II)}} According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler [[Leni Riefenstahl]], Hitler said that \"if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]\".{{sfn |Riefenstahl|1987|p= 295}} Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Broad|1958|p= 113}}\n\nBradley and Buell conclude that \"although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait.\"{{sfn|Bradley|Buell|2002|p=101}} On the other hand, Richter calls Eden's arguments a \"falsification of history\".{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp = 639\u201340}} [[Basil Liddell Hart]] and de Guingand point out that the delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among Britain's strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita. In 1952, the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p= 640}} According to Robert Kirchubel, \"the main causes for deferring Barbarossa's start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring.\"{{sfn | Kirchubel |2005|p= 16}} This does not answer whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan. Keegan writes:\n{{Quote | In the aftermath, historians would measure its significance in terms of the delay Marita had or had not imposed on the unleashing of Barbarossa, an exercise ultimately to be judged profitless, since it was the Russian weather, not the contingencies of subsidiary campaigns, which determined Barbarossa's launch date.{{sfn|Keegan|2005|p=158}} }}\n\n[[Antony Beevor]] wrote in 2012 about the current thinking of historians with regard to delays caused by German attacks in the Balkans that \"most accept that it made little difference\" to the eventual outcome of Barbarossa.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=158}} US Army analyst Richard Hooker, Jr., calculates that the 22 June start date of Barbarossa was sufficient for the Germans to advance to Moscow by mid-August, and he says that the victories in the Balkans raised the morale of the German soldier.{{sfn|Hooker|1999}} Historian [[David Glantz]] wrote that the German invasion of the Balkans \"helped conceal Barbarossa\" from the Soviet leadership, and contributed to the German success in achieving strategic surprise. Glantz states that while the Balkans operations contributed to delays in launching Barbarossa, these acted to discredit Soviet intelligence reports which accurately predicted the initially planned invasion date.{{sfn|Glantz|2003|p=27}} [[Jack P. Greene]] agrees that \"other factors were more important\" as regards the delaying of Barbarossa, but he also argues that the Panzer divisions, which had been in service during Operation Marita, \"had to undergo refit\".{{sfn|Greene|2014|p=563}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{Cnote |a|Sources do not agree on the number of the soldiers the British Empire managed to evacuate. According to British sources, 50,732 soldiers were evacuated.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|p=105}}{{sfn|Titterton|2002|p=84}} But of these, according to G.A. Titterton, 600 men were lost in the troopship (the former Dutch liner) ''Slamat''.{{Sfn|Duncan}}{{sfn|Titterton|2002|p=84}} Adding 500\u20131,000 stragglers who reached Crete, Titterton estimates that \"the numbers that left Greece and reached Crete or Egypt, including British and Greek troops, must have been around 51,000.\" Gavin Long (part of Australia's official history of World War II) gives a figure around 46,500, while, according to W.

Their assertion was merely an excuse on their part to enable them to plead extenuating circumstances in justification of their aggression against a small nation, already entangled in a war against a Great Power. But, irrespective of the presence or absence of British troops in the Balkans, German intervention would have taken place firstly because the Germans had to secure the right flank of the German Army which was to operate against Russia according to the plans already prepared in autumn 1940 and secondly because the possession of the southern part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] commanding the eastern end of the Mediterranean was of great strategic importance for Germany's plan of attacking Great Britain and the line of Imperial communications with the East.{{Sfn |Papagos|1949|p= 317}}}}\n\n{{Cnote |f|During the night of 6 April 1941, while the German invasion had already begun, the Yugoslavs informed the Greeks that they would implement the plan: they would attack the Italian troops in the morning of the next day at 6:00 a.m. At 3:00 a.m. of 7 April, the 13th division of the Greek Epirus Army attacked the Italian troops, occupied two heights and captured 565 Italians (15 officers and 550 soldiers).

The Italian invasion in October 1940, which is usually known as the [[Greco-Italian War]], was followed by the German invasion in April 1941. [[Battle of Crete|German landings on the island of Crete]] (May 1941) came after Allied forces had been defeated in mainland Greece. These battles were part of the greater [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] of Germany.\n\nFollowing the Italian invasion on 28 October 1940, Greece repelled the initial Italian attack and a counter-attack in March 1941. When the German invasion, known as Operation Marita, began on 6 April, the bulk of the [[Hellenic army|Greek Army]] was on the Greek border with [[Albania under Italy|Albania]], then a vassal of Italy, from which the Italian troops had attacked. [[Wehrmacht|German troops]] invaded from [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]], creating a second front. Greece received a small reinforcement from [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] forces in anticipation of the German attack. The Greek army found itself outnumbered in its effort to defend against both Italian and German troops. As a result, the [[Metaxas Line|Metaxas defensive line]] did not receive adequate troop reinforcements and was quickly overrun by the Germans, who then outflanked the Greek forces at the Albanian border, forcing their surrender. British, Australian and New Zealand forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat, with the ultimate goal of evacuation. For several days, Allied troops played an important part in containing the German advance on the [[Thermopylae]] position, allowing ships to be prepared to evacuate the units defending Greece.{{sfn|Johnston|2013|p=18}} The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] reached the capital, [[Athens]], on 27 April{{Cref |a}} and Greece's southern shore on 30 April, capturing 7,000 British, Australian and New Zealand personnel and ending the battle with a decisive victory. The conquest of Greece was completed with the capture of Crete a month later. Following its fall, Greece was occupied by the military forces of Germany, Italy and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=102\u20136}}\n\n[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] later blamed the failure of his [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], which had to be delayed, on [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s failed conquest of Greece.{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|p=178}} The theory that the Battle of Greece procrastinated the invasion of the Soviet Union has been either refuted or downplayed by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy.{{sfn|Hillgruber|1993|p=506}} It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the [[North African Campaign|North African theatre]].

Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion, the British troops that were sent as defensive aid created the possibility of a frontier to the German southern flank. Hitler's principal fear was that British aircraft based in Greece would bomb the Romanian oil fields, which was one of Germany's most important sources of oil.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As Hitler was already seriously considering launching an invasion of the Soviet Union the next year, this increased the importance of Romanian oil as once Germany was at war with the Soviet Union, Romania would be the ''Reich'''s only source of oil, at least until the Wehrmacht presumably captured the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As the British were indeed contemplating using the Greek air fields to bomb the Romanian oil fields, Hitler's fears that his entire war machine might be paralyzed for a lack of oil should the Ploie\u0219ti oil fields be destroyed were to a certain extent grounded in reality.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} However, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg noted: \"...the enormous difficulties of air attacks on distant oil fields were not understood by either side at this time; it was assumed on both sides that even small air raids could bring about vast fire and destruction\".{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} Furthermore, the massive Italian defeats in the Balkans, the Horn of Africa and North Africa had pushed the Fascist regime in Italy to the brink of collapse by late 1940 with Mussolini becoming extremely unpopular with the Italian people, and Hitler was convinced that if he did not rescue Mussolini, Fascist Italy would be knocked out of the war in 1941.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} Weinberg wrote the continuing Italian defeats \"....could easily lead to the complete collapse of the whole system Mussolini had established, and this was recognized at the time; it is not hindsight from 1943\".{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} If Italy was knocked out of the war, then the British would be able to use the central Mediterranean again, and the governors of the French colonies in Africa loyal to the Vichy regime might switch their loyalties to the Free French National Committee headed by Charles de Gaulle.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=213}} As Hitler had plans to ultimately use the French colonies in Africa as bases for the war against Britain, the potential loss of Vichy control over its Africa empire was seen as a problem by him.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|2008|pp=183\u2013186}}\n\nFurthermore, after Italy entered the war in June 1940, the danger of Axis air and naval attacks had largely closed the central Mediterranean to British shipping except for [[Malta convoys|supply convoys]] to Malta, in effect closing the Suez canal as the British were forced to supply their forces in Egypt via the long Cape route around Africa.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=211\u2013214}} The British had made liberating Italian East Africa a priority to end the possibility of Italian naval and air attacks on British shipping on the Red Sea, which assumed greater importance because of the dangers posed to British shipping in the central Mediterranean.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=211}} In turn, the decision by Field Marshal [[Archibald Wavell]] to deploy significant forces to the Horn of Africa while as defending Egypt lessened the number of Commonwealth forces available to go to Greece.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2000|pp=98\u2013108}} Through the performance of the Italian armed forces had been less than impressive, from the German perspective denying the British access to the central Mediterranean by stationing Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Italy made it crucial to keep Italy in the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|pp=213\u2013214}} Hitler ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in Romania and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases.{{Sfn | Blau| 1986 | pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_1.htm 5\u20137]}}<ref name = \"H\" />\n\nOn 12 November, the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Armed Forces High Command]] issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against [[Gibraltar]] and Greece for the following January. On 17 November 1940, Metaxas proposed a joint offensive in the Balkans to the British government, with Greek strongholds in southern Albania as the operational base. The British were reluctant to discuss Metaxas' proposal, because the troops necessary for implementing the Greek plan would seriously endanger operations in North Africa.{{sfn|Svolopoulos|1997|pp =285, 288}} In December 1940, German ambitions in the Mediterranean underwent considerable revision when Spain's General [[Francisco Franco]] rejected the Gibraltar attack.{{sfn| Keitel | 1979 | pp = 154\u201355}} Consequently, Germany's offensive in southern Europe was restricted to the Greek campaign.

The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece, but few planes could be diverted to the theatre. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the [[Aegean Sea]]. These [[Logistics|logistical]] problems were aggravated by the limited availability of shipping and Greek port capacity.{{sfn|Blau|1986|pp = [http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 79\u201380]}}\n\nThe [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Twelfth Army]]\u2014under the command of [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm List]]\u2014was charged with the execution of Operation Marita.

Their strategy was to create a diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.{{sfn|Blau|1986|pp=[http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/balkan/20_260_3.htm 82\u201383]}}\n\nThe Yugoslav ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' led to a sudden change in the plan of attack and confronted the Twelfth Army with a number of difficult problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via [[Ni\u0161]] toward [[Belgrade]]. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise.

He had been told by Wavell that [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] Menzies had approved the plan.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|p = [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]}} The proposal had been accepted by a meeting of the War Cabinet in London at which Menzies was present but the Australian Prime Minister had been told by Churchill that both Freyberg and Blamey approved of the expedition.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p=338}} On 5 March, in a letter to Menzies, Blamey said that \"the plan is, of course, what I feared: piecemeal dispatch to Europe\" and the next day he called the operation \"most hazardous\". Thinking that he was agreeable, the Australian Government had already committed the Australian Imperial Force to the Greek Campaign.{{Sfn |McClymont|1959|pp = [http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c6-13.html 115], [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Gree-c23-2.html 476]}}\n\n===Impact on Operation Barbarossa===\nIn 1942, members of the [[British Parliament]] characterised the campaign in Greece as a \"political and sentimental decision\". Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp = 638\u201339}} This is an argument that historians used to assert that Greek resistance was a turning point in World War II.{{Sfn | Eggenberger |1985| loc =Greece (World War II)}} According to film-maker and friend of Adolf Hitler [[Leni Riefenstahl]], Hitler said that \"if the Italians hadn't attacked Greece and needed our help, the war would have taken a different course. We could have anticipated the Russian cold by weeks and conquered Leningrad and Moscow. There would have been no [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]\".{{sfn |Riefenstahl|1987|p= 295}} Despite his reservations, Brooke seems also to have conceded that the Balkan Campaign delayed the offensive against the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Broad|1958|p= 113}}\n\nBradley and Buell conclude that \"although no single segment of the Balkan campaign forced the Germans to delay Barbarossa, obviously the entire campaign did prompt them to wait.\"{{sfn|Bradley|Buell|2002|p=101}} On the other hand, Richter calls Eden's arguments a \"falsification of history\".{{sfn|Richter|1998|pp = 639\u201340}} [[Basil Liddell Hart]] and de Guingand point out that the delay of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union was not among Britain's strategic goals and as a result the possibility of such a delay could not have affected its decisions about Operation Marita. In 1952, the Historical Branch of the UK Cabinet Office concluded that the Balkan Campaign had no influence on the launching of Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Richter|1998|p= 640}} According to Robert Kirchubel, \"the main causes for deferring Barbarossa's start from 15 May to 22 June were incomplete logistical arrangements and an unusually wet winter that kept rivers at full flood until late spring.\"{{sfn | Kirchubel |2005|p= 16}} This does not answer whether in the absence of these problems the campaign could have begun according to the original plan. Keegan writes:\n{{Quote | In the aftermath, historians would measure its significance in terms of the delay Marita had or had not imposed on the unleashing of Barbarossa, an exercise ultimately to be judged profitless, since it was the Russian weather, not the contingencies of subsidiary campaigns, which determined Barbarossa's launch date.{{sfn|Keegan|2005|p=158}} }}\n\n[[Antony Beevor]] wrote in 2012 about the current thinking of historians with regard to delays caused by German attacks in the Balkans that \"most accept that it made little difference\" to the eventual outcome of Barbarossa.{{sfn|Beevor|2012|p=158}} US Army analyst Richard Hooker, Jr., calculates that the 22 June start date of Barbarossa was sufficient for the Germans to advance to Moscow by mid-August, and he says that the victories in the Balkans raised the morale of the German soldier.{{sfn|Hooker|1999}} Historian [[David Glantz]] wrote that the German invasion of the Balkans \"helped conceal Barbarossa\" from the Soviet leadership, and contributed to the German success in achieving strategic surprise. Glantz states that while the Balkans operations contributed to delays in launching Barbarossa, these acted to discredit Soviet intelligence reports which accurately predicted the initially planned invasion date.{{sfn|Glantz|2003|p=27}} [[Jack P. Greene]] agrees that \"other factors were more important\" as regards the delaying of Barbarossa, but he also argues that the Panzer divisions, which had been in service during Operation Marita, \"had to undergo refit\".{{sfn|Greene|2014|p=563}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{Cnote |a|Sources do not agree on the number of the soldiers the British Empire managed to evacuate.

Their assertion was merely an excuse on their part to enable them to plead extenuating circumstances in justification of their aggression against a small nation, already entangled in a war against a Great Power. But, irrespective of the presence or absence of British troops in the Balkans, German intervention would have taken place firstly because the Germans had to secure the right flank of the German Army which was to operate against Russia according to the plans already prepared in autumn 1940 and secondly because the possession of the southern part of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] commanding the eastern end of the Mediterranean was of great strategic importance for Germany's plan of attacking Great Britain and the line of Imperial communications with the East.{{Sfn |Papagos|1949|p= 317}}}}\n\n{{Cnote |f|During the night of 6 April 1941, while the German invasion had already begun, the Yugoslavs informed the Greeks that they would implement the plan: they would attack the Italian troops in the morning of the next day at 6:00 a.m. At 3:00 a.m. of 7 April, the 13th division of the Greek Epirus Army attacked the Italian troops, occupied two heights and captured 565 Italians (15 officers and 550 soldiers).
