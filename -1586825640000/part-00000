The audience passes several office doors, all featuring outlandish job descriptions and spoof movie posters featuring the Muppets, including ''The Bride of Froggen-Schwein'', ''The Pigseidon Adventure'', and ''SuperBeaker II''. Guests then enter a large room filled with Muppet \"props\" and boxes with comical and humorous labels. Above guests' heads are sets of three television monitors, where the pre-show featuring several Muppets is shown.\n\nThe audience is repeatedly reminded to take a pair of 3D glasses from several containers around the room before entering the theater, which is modeled after the theater depicted on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. Muppet*Vision 3D is the only Disney 3D attraction currently playing which refers to the glasses as \"3D Glasses\" (''[[It's Tough to Be a Bug!]]'' utilizes \"Bug Eyes\", ''[[Star Tours \u2013 The Adventures Continue]]'' refers to them as \"Flight Glasses\", [[Avatar Flight of Passage|''Avatar'' Flight of Passage]] calls them \"Flight Visors\", [[Toy Story Midway Mania!]] calls them \"3D Game Glasses\", [[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!]] referred to them as \u201cSafety Goggles\u201d, and ''[[Mickey's PhilharMagic]]'' calls them \"Opera Glasses\"). However, the glasses are sometimes referred to as \"3D Safety Goggles\", foreshadowing the \"dangerous\" experiments guests will be visiting.\n\nAt Disney California Adventure, the queue was different in that it featured a cast member at the turnstile handing out the glasses individually and the \"hallway\" scene from the Disney's Hollywood Studios queue was replaced with a \"courtyard\" filled with various props. The queue winded around a fake \"set\", blending in with the rest of the Hollywood Land district.  Guests also saw half of a motorbike protruding from the wall above, with a hole in the shape of [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]]. The pre-show room there included a scrolling LED monitor known as The Official Time Clock which displayed various messages and jokes (including references to [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[The Mickey Mouse Club]]) while counting down to showtime.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, the queue was replaced with an eating area for the nearby Award Weiners restaurant in order to provide more seating for it. The spoof movie posters were removed, now in their place are real movie posters promoting current and upcoming films from [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. The original \"Disaster Effects\" storage area remained until January 2015.\n\n[[List of Muppets#Constantine|Constantine]], the villain from ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', was added to the pre-show at beginning of March 2014 to advertise the new film. In Disney's Hollywood Studios, as of December 2016, Constantine no longer appears and the pre-show is reverted to its original 1991 form.\n\n===Plot synopsis===\n[[File:dca muppet theater.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Main Theater in Disney California Adventure.]]\n\nThe show begins with [[Statler and Waldorf]] in their usual box putting on the glasses, and heckling the audience. A penguin orchestra rises up. They tune and play a fanfare, which leads into the opening. [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] appears behind a door and pushes a stick labeled \"3D\" towards the audience. [[Kermit the Frog]] appears and welcomes the audience to Muppet*Vision 3D. He then gives the audience a tour of Muppet Studios, where many of the Muppets are preparing for segments in the show to follow the tour. Many 3D effects are performed at this point by various characters, mainly [[Fozzie Bear]]. This includes a noisemaker, a can of springs, and a flower that sprays water. Kermit then takes the audience to the Muppet's top secret laboratory where he explains that they hired scientists from all over the world to come and work there. He then says, \"Unfortunately, none of them showed up.\" He then introduces [[Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and his assistant, [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. \n\nThe show re-introduces [[Waldo C. Graphic]], the world's first computer-generated Muppet, (who first appeared in ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]''.) Waldo is \"created\" by Dr. Honeydew and Beaker during a demonstration of three-dimensional imagery but he proves to be uncontrollable and wreaks havoc in the lab. Dr. Honeydew tells Beaker to use the lab's inflatomatic to deactivate Waldo. He does so, but instead of being deactivated, Waldo explodes into smaller versions of himself and says that he can start his own football team. Dr. Honeydew then tells Beaker to use the lab's [[vacuum cleaner]] to suck up all the Waldos, but also accidentally sucks up the entire lab. All but one Waldo is sucked up and realizing he's free, [[shape shifts]] into a taxi cab and drives away.\n\nKermit then reappears and apologizes for the delay since the lab was \"sucked up\". Fozzie returns and attempts to demonstrate his flying pie but it malfunctions and hits him in the face. Kermit then says, \"Fozzie, that's terrible.\" Fozzie then replies with, \"You're right. It needs more sugar.\" He walks away, and Kermit introduces [[Miss Piggy]]'s musical rendition of \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\". [[Bean Bunny]] attempts to assist Miss Piggy by using various props to add 3d effects. These include a butterfly on a fishing rod, a bee on a fishing rod, and bubbles blown from a bubble maker. To add the realism, real soap bubbles are blown from the ceiling. Miss Piggy gets annoyed and tells him to knock it off. Bean then gives her a rope, explaining that it's for the [[water skiing]] finale. A toy boat pulls Miss Piggy into the pond and gets her wet. [[Sam Eagle]] enters the scene and sends Bean away before he ruins the film more. He leaves and meets Waldo and together, they leave the film. Gonzo sees Bean and Waldo leaving and gathers the rest of the Muppets to help him look for Bean. [[Sweetums]] (who is a live full-bodied Muppet) comes out into the audience to search for him having already done so on screen. With help from the audience, he finds Bean on the other side balcony, across from Waldorf and Statler. He explains why he ran away and agrees to stay if he can help in the finale. The Muppets decide to let Bean shoot off the fireworks. \n\nThe finale begins with a toy soldier marching band playing patriotic music. During their performance, Waldo bounces on their heads and one of the tuba players gets his head stuck inside. To make matters worse, since he cannot see, he runs into people and causes them to fall down. Sam then tells Bean to shoot off the fireworks. To show off, Waldo shape shifts into a rocket and zooms around Miss Piggy, who is dressed like the Statue of Liberty, and accidentally tears her skirt off. Waldo then plummets into the penguin orchestra, causing smoke to rise. Sweetums reappears and puts out the fire with water, which infuriates the penguins and they decide to retaliate with a cannon. After Sweetums tells the audience to duck (in which Waldo briefly transformed into a literal duck), the penguins fire their cannon and hit the projector.\n\nThe Swedish Chef, who is operating the projector, then tries to destroy the now out of control Waldo, who he believes destroyed the film and is now all alone on a blank screen, by firing a gun at him. After missing several times (shooting holes in the screen, as well as the theater wall), the Swedish Chef decides to use a cannon. This causes an explosion as the theater blows up, tearing a hole in the screen, as well as \"revealing\" some bricks and sheetrock throughout the main theater, and revealing what's on the \"other side\" of the screen: guests at a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Park]]. Kermit then appears on the back of a [[fire engine]] through the hole to apologize for the delays. He then bids the audience a final farewell and the curtains close. Waldo appears one last time and shape shifts into [[Mickey Mouse]] so that nobody would recognize him. However, he shape shifts back to his true form as a vacuum sucks him up. Bean comments on what a cute ending the show was as the curtains on his balcony close. Waldorf asks Statler what he thought of the show. He asks Waldorf if they have time to go to the bathroom before the next shows starts. He replies with, \"We can't you old fool. We're bolted to the seats.\" Then the curtains on their balcony close and the show ends. A cast member then thanks the audience for coming to see the show and tells them how to exit properly, while reminding them to return their 3D glasses into the bins outside of the theater.\n\nAside from the Muppets on-screen, there are also a number of in-theater Muppets, mostly [[audio-animatronic]], that interact with the show. [[Statler and Waldorf]] heckle from a balcony near the screen, an orchestra of penguins rises into sight to perform, and the [[Swedish Chef]] \"operates\" the film projector from the booth above and behind the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Henson]] \u2013 [[Kermit the Frog]] (1955-1990), [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]] (1975-1990), [[Swedish Chef|The Swedish Chef]] (1975-1990)\n* [[Frank Oz]] \u2013 [[Miss Piggy]] (1976-2002), [[Fozzie Bear]] (1976-2000), Boss (Construction Worker), [[Sam Eagle]] (1975-2000)\n* [[Dave Goelz]] \u2013 [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] (1976-present), Rick, [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] (1976-present), [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]] (1975-present), Dinah\n* [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] \u2013 [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] (1976-1991), [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]] (1976-1991), [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]] (1977-1991), [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]] (1975-1991), Chuck, Chicken\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] \u2013 [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Waldo C.

The audience passes several office doors, all featuring outlandish job descriptions and spoof movie posters featuring the Muppets, including ''The Bride of Froggen-Schwein'', ''The Pigseidon Adventure'', and ''SuperBeaker II''. Guests then enter a large room filled with Muppet \"props\" and boxes with comical and humorous labels. Above guests' heads are sets of three television monitors, where the pre-show featuring several Muppets is shown.\n\nThe audience is repeatedly reminded to take a pair of 3D glasses from several containers around the room before entering the theater, which is modeled after the theater depicted on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. Muppet*Vision 3D is the only Disney 3D attraction currently playing which refers to the glasses as \"3D Glasses\" (''[[It's Tough to Be a Bug!]]'' utilizes \"Bug Eyes\", ''[[Star Tours \u2013 The Adventures Continue]]'' refers to them as \"Flight Glasses\", [[Avatar Flight of Passage|''Avatar'' Flight of Passage]] calls them \"Flight Visors\", [[Toy Story Midway Mania!]] calls them \"3D Game Glasses\", [[Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!]] referred to them as \u201cSafety Goggles\u201d, and ''[[Mickey's PhilharMagic]]'' calls them \"Opera Glasses\"). However, the glasses are sometimes referred to as \"3D Safety Goggles\", foreshadowing the \"dangerous\" experiments guests will be visiting.\n\nAt Disney California Adventure, the queue was different in that it featured a cast member at the turnstile handing out the glasses individually and the \"hallway\" scene from the Disney's Hollywood Studios queue was replaced with a \"courtyard\" filled with various props. The queue winded around a fake \"set\", blending in with the rest of the Hollywood Land district.  Guests also saw half of a motorbike protruding from the wall above, with a hole in the shape of [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]]. The pre-show room there included a scrolling LED monitor known as The Official Time Clock which displayed various messages and jokes (including references to [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[The Mickey Mouse Club]]) while counting down to showtime.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, the queue was replaced with an eating area for the nearby Award Weiners restaurant in order to provide more seating for it. The spoof movie posters were removed, now in their place are real movie posters promoting current and upcoming films from [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. The original \"Disaster Effects\" storage area remained until January 2015.\n\n[[List of Muppets#Constantine|Constantine]], the villain from ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', was added to the pre-show at beginning of March 2014 to advertise the new film. In Disney's Hollywood Studios, as of December 2016, Constantine no longer appears and the pre-show is reverted to its original 1991 form.\n\n===Plot synopsis===\n[[File:dca muppet theater.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Main Theater in Disney California Adventure.]]\n\nThe show begins with [[Statler and Waldorf]] in their usual box putting on the glasses, and heckling the audience. A penguin orchestra rises up. They tune and play a fanfare, which leads into the opening. [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]] appears behind a door and pushes a stick labeled \"3D\" towards the audience. [[Kermit the Frog]] appears and welcomes the audience to Muppet*Vision 3D. He then gives the audience a tour of Muppet Studios, where many of the Muppets are preparing for segments in the show to follow the tour. Many 3D effects are performed at this point by various characters, mainly [[Fozzie Bear]]. This includes a noisemaker, a can of springs, and a flower that sprays water. Kermit then takes the audience to the Muppet's top secret laboratory where he explains that they hired scientists from all over the world to come and work there. He then says, \"Unfortunately, none of them showed up.\" He then introduces [[Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]] and his assistant, [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]]. \n\nThe show re-introduces [[Waldo C. Graphic]], the world's first computer-generated Muppet, (who first appeared in ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]''.) Waldo is \"created\" by Dr. Honeydew and Beaker during a demonstration of three-dimensional imagery but he proves to be uncontrollable and wreaks havoc in the lab. Dr. Honeydew tells Beaker to use the lab's inflatomatic to deactivate Waldo. He does so, but instead of being deactivated, Waldo explodes into smaller versions of himself and says that he can start his own football team. Dr. Honeydew then tells Beaker to use the lab's [[vacuum cleaner]] to suck up all the Waldos, but also accidentally sucks up the entire lab. All but one Waldo is sucked up and realizing he's free, [[shape shifts]] into a taxi cab and drives away.\n\nKermit then reappears and apologizes for the delay since the lab was \"sucked up\". Fozzie returns and attempts to demonstrate his flying pie but it malfunctions and hits him in the face. Kermit then says, \"Fozzie, that's terrible.\" Fozzie then replies with, \"You're right. It needs more sugar.\" He walks away, and Kermit introduces [[Miss Piggy]]'s musical rendition of \"[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]\". [[Bean Bunny]] attempts to assist Miss Piggy by using various props to add 3d effects. These include a butterfly on a fishing rod, a bee on a fishing rod, and bubbles blown from a bubble maker. To add the realism, real soap bubbles are blown from the ceiling. Miss Piggy gets annoyed and tells him to knock it off. Bean then gives her a rope, explaining that it's for the [[water skiing]] finale. A toy boat pulls Miss Piggy into the pond and gets her wet. [[Sam Eagle]] enters the scene and sends Bean away before he ruins the film more. He leaves and meets Waldo and together, they leave the film. Gonzo sees Bean and Waldo leaving and gathers the rest of the Muppets to help him look for Bean. [[Sweetums]] (who is a live full-bodied Muppet) comes out into the audience to search for him having already done so on screen. With help from the audience, he finds Bean on the other side balcony, across from Waldorf and Statler. He explains why he ran away and agrees to stay if he can help in the finale. The Muppets decide to let Bean shoot off the fireworks. \n\nThe finale begins with a toy soldier marching band playing patriotic music. During their performance, Waldo bounces on their heads and one of the tuba players gets his head stuck inside. To make matters worse, since he cannot see, he runs into people and causes them to fall down. Sam then tells Bean to shoot off the fireworks. To show off, Waldo shape shifts into a rocket and zooms around Miss Piggy, who is dressed like the Statue of Liberty, and accidentally tears her skirt off. Waldo then plummets into the penguin orchestra, causing smoke to rise. Sweetums reappears and puts out the fire with water, which infuriates the penguins and they decide to retaliate with a cannon. After Sweetums tells the audience to duck (in which Waldo briefly transformed into a literal duck), the penguins fire their cannon and hit the projector.\n\nThe Swedish Chef, who is operating the projector, then tries to destroy the now out of control Waldo, who he believes destroyed the film and is now all alone on a blank screen, by firing a gun at him. After missing several times (shooting holes in the screen, as well as the theater wall), the Swedish Chef decides to use a cannon. This causes an explosion as the theater blows up, tearing a hole in the screen, as well as \"revealing\" some bricks and sheetrock throughout the main theater, and revealing what's on the \"other side\" of the screen: guests at a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney Park]]. Kermit then appears on the back of a [[fire engine]] through the hole to apologize for the delays. He then bids the audience a final farewell and the curtains close. Waldo appears one last time and shape shifts into [[Mickey Mouse]] so that nobody would recognize him. However, he shape shifts back to his true form as a vacuum sucks him up. Bean comments on what a cute ending the show was as the curtains on his balcony close. Waldorf asks Statler what he thought of the show. He asks Waldorf if they have time to go to the bathroom before the next shows starts. He replies with, \"We can't you old fool. We're bolted to the seats.\" Then the curtains on their balcony close and the show ends. A cast member then thanks the audience for coming to see the show and tells them how to exit properly, while reminding them to return their 3D glasses into the bins outside of the theater.\n\nAside from the Muppets on-screen, there are also a number of in-theater Muppets, mostly [[audio-animatronic]], that interact with the show. [[Statler and Waldorf]] heckle from a balcony near the screen, an orchestra of penguins rises into sight to perform, and the [[Swedish Chef]] \"operates\" the film projector from the booth above and behind the audience.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Henson]] \u2013 [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]], [[Swedish Chef|The Swedish Chef]]\n* [[Frank Oz]] \u2013 [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], Boss (Construction Worker), [[Sam Eagle]]\n* [[Dave Goelz]] \u2013 [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], Rick, [[Bunsen Honeydew|Dr. Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]], Dinah\n* [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]] \u2013 [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]], [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], [[List of Muppets#Sweetums|Sweetums]], Chuck, Chicken\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] \u2013 [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Waldo C.

It was developed by [[Thomas Edison]], patented in 1890,<ref>https://patents.google.com/patent/US438310</ref> and was licensed in 1909 under General Electric's [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]] trademark. The bulbs have [[Screw thread#Handedness|right-hand threaded]] metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (lamp holders). For bulbs powered by [[Single-phase electric power|AC current]], the thread is generally connected to [[Ground and neutral|neutral]] and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to the \"live\" phase.\n\nIn North America and continental Europe, Edison screws displaced other socket types for general lighting.  In the early days of electrification, Edison screws were the only standard connector, and appliances other than light bulbs were connected to AC power via lamp sockets. Today Edison screw sockets comply with international standards.\n\n== History ==\nIn the United States, early manufacturers of incandescent lamps used several different and incompatible bases. The [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] used a threaded stud at the bottom of the socket and a flat contact ring. The Sawyer-Mann or [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] base used a spring clip acting on grooves in the bulb base and a contact stud at the bottom of the lamp. By about 1908, the Edison base was most common in the U.S. with the others falling out of use.<ref>I.C.S.

This is distinct from the glass envelope (bulb)  diameter, which in the U.S. is given in eighths of an inch, e.g., A19, [[Multifaceted reflector|MR16]], T12.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lightopedia.com/lamp-size-reference |title=Lamp Size Reference |publisher=lightopedia.com |access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThere are four commonly used thread size groups for mains supply lamps:\n\n# {{anchor|Candelabra|E12}}Candelabra: E12 North America, E11 in Europe\n# {{anchor|E17}}Intermediate: E17 North America, E14 (Small ES, SES) in Europe\n# {{anchor|Standard|E26}}Medium or standard: E26 (MES) in North America, E27 (ES) in Europe\n# {{anchor|Mogul|E39}}Mogul: E39 North America, {{anchor|Goliath|E40}}E40 (Goliath ES) in Europe.\n\nThe E26 and E27 are usually interchangeable, as are the E39 and E40, because there is only a 1&nbsp;mm difference in thread outside diameter. E11 and E12 are not interchangeable. Other semi-standard screw thread sizes are available for certain specific applications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bulbs.com/learning/shapesandsizes.aspx |title=Light Bulb Shape and Size Chart {{!}} Reference Charts |publisher=Bulbs.com |access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe large E39 \"Mogul\" and E40 \"Goliath\" base are used on [[street light]]s, and high-wattage lamps (such as a 100&nbsp;W / 200&nbsp;W / 300&nbsp;W 3-way) and many [[High-intensity discharge lamp|high-intensity discharge lamps]]. In areas following the U.S. [[National Electrical Code]], general-use lamps over 300&nbsp;W cannot use an E26 base and must instead use the E39 base. Medium Edison screw (MES) bulbs for 12&nbsp;V are also produced for [[recreational vehicle]]s. Large outdoor Christmas lights use Intermediate base, as do some desk lamps and many [[microwave oven]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Previously, [[emergency exit]] signs also tended to use the intermediate base,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} but U.S. and Canadian rules now require long-life and energy-efficient [[LED lamp]]s, which can be purchased inside a conventional Edison base bulb as a [[Retrofitting|retrofit]]. A medium screw base should not carry more than 25 [[ampere]]s current; this may limit the practical rating of [[low voltage]] lamps.<ref>General Electric ''Incandescent Lamps'' manual, publication no. TP 110, 1976, p. 12</ref>\n\nE29 \"Admedium\" bases are used for special applications, for example UV spotlight lamps in magnetic crack detection machines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn countries that use 220\u2013240 volt [[alternating current|AC]] [[Mains electricity|domestic power]], standard-size E27 and small E14 are the most common screw-mount sizes and are prevalent throughout continental Europe and [[China]].\n\nIn 120-volt [[North America]], 100-volt [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]], the standard size for general-purpose lamps is E26.<ref>[https://www.ledwaves.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions \"The E26 is the standard 120 Volt American base.\"] LED waves, FAQ, retrieved 5 February 2018</ref>\n\nE12 is typically used for candelabra fixtures. E17 is also sometimes used, especially in small [[Light fixture|table lamps]] and novelty lighting, and occasionally the lights on newer [[ceiling fan]]s. [[Christmas lights]] use various base sizes E17 for C9 bulbs, E12 for C7 bulbs, E10 for decades-old [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series-wired]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020231535/http://www.oldchristmaslights.com/lamp_evolution.htm C6 bulb sets] in the U.S., and an entirely different [[wedge base]] for T1\u00be mini lights. For a short time early on, these mini lights were manufactured using E5 screw bases.\n\nA tiny E5 or E5.5 size is used only for [[extra-low voltage]]s, such as in interior [[lighting|illumination]] for [[model building]]s, and model [[vehicle]]s such as [[Rail transport modelling|model train]]s. These are often called \"[[pea]] bulbs\" if they are globe-shaped, but they commonly look like mini Christmas bulbs, or large \"grain-of-[[wheat]]\" bulbs. E10 bulbs are common on [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[flashlight]]s, as are bayonet mounts (although those are usually held in with a circular [[flange]] located where the base meets the glass envelope of the bulb). The E11 base is sometimes used for 50/75/100-watt halogen lights in North America, where it is called the \"mini-can\", and tighter threads are used to keep them out of E12-base [[nightlight]]s and other places where they could start a fire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThere are also adapters between screw sizes, and for adapting to or from bayonet caps. A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] that doesn't fit in a [[Recessed light|recessed lighting]] fixture.\n\nMost Edison screws have right-hand threads (lamp is turned [[clockwise]] to tighten), but left-hand threaded screws are sometimes used, usually for a non-standard voltage or wattage bulb. This prevents the use of an incorrect bulb, which could cause damage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lightbulbs.com/blog/left-handed-incandescent-light-bulbs |title=Left Handed Incandescent Light Bulbs?|last=|first=|date=24 March 2011 |publisher=eLightBulbs |access-date=|last1=Eisenbraun|first1=Blair|accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref> Public locations such as railway trains and the [[New York City Subway]] have used light bulbs with left-hand threads to discourage theft of the bulbs for use in regular light fixtures.<ref>{{cite book |last=McManus |first=Chris |title=Right Hand, Left Hand: The Origins of Asymmetry in Brains, Bodies, Atoms and Cultures |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2004 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20oza63ZuG4C&lpg=PA46&dq=left%20handed%20light%20bulbs&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=left%20handed%20light%20bulbs&f=false |accessdate=2015-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World |last=Schneier |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Schneier |page=221 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EALEaiVhmjoC&lpg=PP1&dq=Schneier%20Beyond%20Fear&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q=light%20bulbs&f=false |accessdate=2015-01-25}}</ref>\n\n== Other uses ==\n[[File:D12cord.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1909 toaster with Edison plug]]\n\nThe Edison screw socket was used as an outlet (such as for [[toaster]]s) when [[mains electricity]] was still mainly used for [[lighting]], and before wall outlets became common.\n\nIn North America, [[Fuse (electrical)|fuses]] were used in buildings wired before 1960. These [[Fuse (electrical)#North America|Edison base fuses]] would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps.\n\nSome adapters for [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlet]]s use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket to become an ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a [[porch]] light), or to make a [[Pullstring|pull-chain]] switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a lamp holder (lamp socket).\n\nVarious other accessories have been made, including a [[smoke detector]] that [[Rechargeable battery|recharges]] over a few hours and lasts for a few days or weeks thereafter, and still allows the attached lamp to operate normally. There have also been electronics that stick onto the end of the screw base and allow the attached lamp to flash, for example, to attract the attention of arriving guests or [[emergency vehicle]]s; others function as a [[dimmer]] or [[timer]], or dim gradually in a child's [[bedroom]] in the evening.\n\nSome thermionic valves [[vacuum tube]]s, such as certain rectifiers, use an Edison screw base.\n\n== Fittings ==\n[[File:E24 E14 E10.jpg|thumb|upright|center|From left to right: E27, E14, and E10 bulbs]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The second contact is used for the lower-wattage filament of the two inside the lamp. This extra contact is a ring located around the main contact. Unlike bayonet sockets, three-way and regular lamps are interchangeable, although the low filament or low setting doesn\u2019t work if mismatched.\n\nThe small Edison screw has nine [[threads per inch]], or a [[Pitch (screw)|pitch]] of {{cvt|1/9|in|mm|4|disp=or}} per thread.\n\nThe medium Edison screw has seven threads per inch, or a pitch of {{cvt|1/7|in|mm|4|disp=or}} per thread.

A lamp base is too short to contact the bottom terminal of a fuse holder.  However it's possible (but not useful) to screw a DII fuse holder without a fuse in an E27 lamp holder.\n\nScrew bases have a number of disadvantages compared to the bayonet fit type:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}\n* The metal screw itself forms one of the contacts for the circuit. If the lighting system is not correctly wired, or a lamp is plugged into a non-polarized outlet, the metal screw can become live, presenting an [[Electrical injury|electric shock]] hazard to anyone attempting to change the lamp.\n* It is possible to over-tighten the screw, risking breaking the bulb or separation of the glass envelope from the metal base and leaving the base in the socket, especially when subsequently attempting to unscrew it.\n* If the lamp becomes loose in the socket due to vibration or under-tightening, it can lose contact with the center contact and stop working until it is tightened. The bayonet type is resistant to vibration and much less likely to become loose.\n* As the metal thread carries current, any arcing can jam the thread.\n* Corrosion is more likely to jam a screw thread than a bayonet fixing.\n* Screwing in and unscrewing the bulb places more force on the glass envelope.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* When fixing anything with a cable attached, the cable will twist as the screw is turned.\n\n==See also==\n* [[A-series light bulb]]\n* [[Multifaceted reflector]]\n* [[Screw thread#Diameters|Screw thread diameters]]\n* [[GU24 lamp fitting]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"iec60061\">{{cite web|url=http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60061_DB.pdf|title=IEC 60061 International Standard \u2013 Lamp caps and holders|date=December 2014|publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]|language=French, English|accessdate=22 March 2015|location=[[Geneva]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416102852/http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60061_DB.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2013|edition=3.51}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=eb>{{cite web|url=http://homerepair.about.com/od/electricalrepair/ss/2007_energybill_4.htm|title=2007 Energy Bill \u2013 Are They Phasing Out or Making Incandescent Bulbs Illegal?

This is distinct from the glass envelope (bulb)  diameter, which in the U.S. is given in eighths of an inch, e.g., A19, [[Multifaceted reflector|MR16]], T12.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lightopedia.com/lamp-size-reference |title=Lamp Size Reference |publisher=lightopedia.com |access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThere are four commonly used thread size groups for mains supply lamps:\n\n# {{anchor|Candelabra|E12}}Candelabra: E12 North America, E11 in Europe\n# {{anchor|E17}}Intermediate: E17 North America, E14 (Small ES, SES) in Europe\n# {{anchor|Standard|E26}}Medium or standard: E26 (MES) in North America, E27 (ES) in Europe\n# {{anchor|Mogul|E39}}Mogul: E39 North America, {{anchor|Goliath|E40}}E40 (Goliath ES) in Europe.\n\nThe E26 and E27 are usually interchangeable, as are the E39 and E40, because there is only a 1&nbsp;mm difference in thread outside diameter. E11 and E12 are not interchangeable. Other semi-standard screw thread sizes are available for certain specific applications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bulbs.com/learning/shapesandsizes.aspx |title=Light Bulb Shape and Size Chart {{!}} Reference Charts |publisher=Bulbs.com |access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe large E39 \"Mogul\" and E40 \"Goliath\" base are used on [[street light]]s, and high-wattage lamps (such as a 100-/200-/300-watt three-way) and many [[High-intensity discharge lamp|high-intensity discharge lamps]]. In areas following the U.S. [[National Electrical Code]], general-use lamps over 300&nbsp;W cannot use an E26 base and must instead use the E39 base. Medium Edison screw (MES) bulbs for 12&nbsp;V are also produced for [[recreational vehicle]]s. Large outdoor Christmas lights use Intermediate base, as do some desk lamps and many [[microwave oven]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Previously, [[emergency exit]] signs also tended to use the intermediate base,{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} but U.S. and Canadian rules now require long-life and energy-efficient [[LED lamp]]s, which can be purchased inside a conventional Edison base bulb as a [[Retrofitting|retrofit]]. A medium screw base should not carry more than 25 [[ampere]]s current; this may limit the practical rating of [[low voltage]] lamps.<ref>General Electric ''Incandescent Lamps'' manual, publication no.

E17 is also sometimes used, especially in small [[Light fixture|table lamps]] and novelty lighting, and occasionally the lights on newer [[ceiling fan]]s. [[Christmas lights]] use various base sizes E17 for C9 bulbs, E12 for C7 bulbs, E10 for decades-old [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series-wired]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020231535/http://www.oldchristmaslights.com/lamp_evolution.htm C6 bulb sets] in the U.S., and an entirely different [[wedge base]] for T1\u00be mini lights. For a short time early on, these mini lights were manufactured using E5 screw bases.\n\nA tiny E5 or E5.5 size is used only for [[extra-low voltage]]s, such as in interior [[lighting|illumination]] for [[model building]]s, and model [[vehicle]]s such as [[Rail transport modelling|model train]]s. These are often called \"[[pea]] bulbs\" if they are globe-shaped, but they commonly look like mini Christmas bulbs, or large \"grain-of-[[wheat]]\" bulbs. E10 bulbs are common on [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered [[flashlight]]s, as are bayonet mounts (although those are usually held in with a circular [[flange]] located where the base meets the glass envelope of the bulb). The E11 base is sometimes used for 50/75/100-watt halogen lights in North America, where it is called the \"mini-can\", and tighter threads are used to keep them out of E12-base [[nightlight]]s and other places where they could start a fire.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThere are also adapters between screw sizes, and for adapting to or from bayonet caps. A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] that doesn't fit in a [[Recessed light|recessed lighting]] fixture.\n\nMost Edison screws have right-hand threads (lamp is turned [[clockwise]] to tighten), but left-hand threaded screws are sometimes used, usually for a non-standard voltage or wattage bulb.

These [[Fuse (electrical)#North America|Edison base fuses]] would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps.\n\nSome adapters for [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall outlet]]s use an Edison screw, allowing a light socket to become an ungrounded electrical outlet (such as to install Christmas lights temporarily via a [[porch]] light), or to make a [[Pullstring|pull-chain]] switch with two outlets, or to split it for two lamps. Another adapter can make a wall outlet into a lamp holder (lamp socket).\n\nVarious other accessories have been made, including a [[smoke detector]] that [[Rechargeable battery|recharges]] over a few hours and lasts for a few days or weeks thereafter, and still allows the attached lamp to operate normally. There have also been electronics that stick onto the end of the screw base and allow the attached lamp to flash, for example, to attract the attention of arriving guests or [[emergency vehicle]]s; others function as a [[dimmer]] or [[timer]], or dim gradually in a child's [[bedroom]] in the evening.\n\nSome thermionic valves [[vacuum tube]]s, such as certain rectifiers, use an Edison screw base.\n\n== Fittings ==\n[[File:E24 E14 E10.jpg|thumb|upright|center|From left to right: E27, E14, and E10 bulbs]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The second contact is used for the lower-wattage filament of the two inside the lamp. This extra contact is a ring located around the main contact. Unlike bayonet sockets, three-way and regular lamps are interchangeable, although the low filament or low setting doesn\u2019t work if mismatched.\n\nThe small Edison screw has nine [[threads per inch]], or a [[Pitch (screw)|pitch]] of {{cvt|1/9|in|mm|4|disp=or}} per thread.\n\nThe medium Edison screw has seven threads per inch, or a pitch of {{cvt|1/7|in|mm|4|disp=or}} per thread. In the U.S., the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] requirement for greater [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] only applies to the medium Edison screw, all other being considered \"specialty\" lamps.<ref name=eb/>\n\n[[IEC 60269#D-system (DIAZED)|Diazed fuses]] DII uses the same E27 thread as standard 230&nbsp;V lamps, but have a longer body and cannot be screwed into a lamp holder (socket). A lamp base is too short to contact the bottom terminal of a fuse holder.  However it's possible (but not useful) to screw a DII fuse holder without a fuse in an E27 lamp holder.\n\nScrew bases have a number of disadvantages compared to the bayonet fit type:{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{original research inline|date=April 2016}}\n* The metal screw itself forms one of the contacts for the circuit. If the lighting system is not correctly wired, or a lamp is plugged into a non-polarized outlet, the metal screw can become live, presenting an [[Electrical injury|electric shock]] hazard to anyone attempting to change the lamp.\n* It is possible to over-tighten the screw, risking breaking the bulb or separation of the glass envelope from the metal base and leaving the base in the socket, especially when subsequently attempting to unscrew it.\n* If the lamp becomes loose in the socket due to vibration or under-tightening, it can lose contact with the center contact and stop working until it is tightened. The bayonet type is resistant to vibration and much less likely to become loose.\n* As the metal thread carries current, any arcing can jam the thread.\n* Corrosion is more likely to jam a screw thread than a bayonet fixing.\n* Screwing in and unscrewing the bulb places more force on the glass envelope.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* When fixing anything with a cable attached, the cable will twist as the screw is turned.\n\n==See also==\n* [[A-series light bulb]]\n* [[Multifaceted reflector]]\n* [[Screw thread#Diameters|Screw thread diameters]]\n* [[GU24 lamp fitting]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"iec60061\">{{cite web|url=http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60061_DB.pdf|title=IEC 60061 International Standard \u2013 Lamp caps and holders|date=December 2014|publisher=[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]|language=French, English|accessdate=22 March 2015|location=[[Geneva]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416102852/http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60061_DB.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2013|edition=3.51}}{{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=eb>{{cite web|url=http://homerepair.about.com/od/electricalrepair/ss/2007_energybill_4.htm|title=2007 Energy Bill \u2013 Are They Phasing Out or Making Incandescent Bulbs Illegal?

The Act was sponsored by Senator [[Carl Hatch]], a Democrat from New Mexico. At the time, Roosevelt was struggling to purge the Democratic party of its more conservative members, who were increasingly aligned with the administration's Republican opponents. The president considered vetoing the legislation or allowing it to become law without his signature, but instead signed it on the last day he could do so.

Therefore, 35 percent of everything within the outer edge of the \"no symbol\" must be the symbol. Additionally, for printed signs under the UK rules, the width of a \"no symbol\" is set at 80 percent the height of the area to which it is printed.\n\nFor computer display and printing, the symbols are supported in [[Unicode]] by combining elements rather than with individual [[code point]s (see below).\n\n==Uses==\nThe \"prohibition\" symbol is used on [[traffic sign]]s, so that drivers can interpret traffic laws quickly while driving. For example:\n\n* [[File:No Left Turn sign.svg|50px]] No left turn or [[File:MUTCD R3-1.svg|50px]] No right turn\n* [[File:No U Turn sign.svg|50px]] No U-turn\n* [[File:MUTCD R8-3.svg|50px]] No parking (English) or [[File:Mexico road sign SR-22.svg|50px]] ''No estacionarse'' (Spanish)\n* [[File:Japan road sign 302.svg|50px]] Road closed to vehicles (Japan), [[File:Zeichen 250 - Verbot f\u00fcr Fahrzeuge aller Art, StVO 1970.svg|50px]] Road closed to vehicles (Germany, but typical in Europe) \n\nSometimes the symbol is used to warn drivers who are not driving motorized vehicles of dangers or prohibitions:\n* [[File:Denmark road sign C26.1.svg|50px]], [[File:Vorschriftszeichen 14a.svg|50px]], No horse-riding\n* [[File:MUTCD R5-6.svg|50px]], [[File:France road sign B9b.svg|50px]], No bicycles\n* [[File:MUTCD R9-3.svg|50px]], [[File:UK traffic sign 625.1.svg|50px]], No pedestrians\n\nBy analogy, the sign is used in public places to refer to prohibited actions not having to do with traffic:\n\n* [[File:No smoking symbol.svg|50px]] [[Smoking ban|No smoking]] (with symbol of a lit cigarette)\n* [[File:No littering.svg|50px]] or [[File:Ontario Rc-4.svg|50px]] No [[litter]]ing (with symbol of person littering or of litter)\n* [[File:Badenverbot.svg|50px]] or [[File:Badeverbot quadrat.svg|50px]] No swimming (with symbol of swimmer in water underneath)\n\nIt is also used on packages sent through the mail and sealed boxes of merchandise that are sold in stores.  Using a graphical symbol is useful when the item must be handled by people who may not all understand the same language. For example:\n\n* Breakable; do not drop\n* Keep away from magnetic fields\n\nIn product documentation, this may be accompanied by drawings of the product being threatened by the prohibited items: for instance, a cartoon of a [[floppy disk]] being menaced by horseshoe magnets.\n\nIt is also used on clothing, linens, and other household products to indicate the care, treatment or cleaning of the item. For example:\n\n* Do not iron\n\nAlso, many companies use the \"prohibition sign\" when describing the services they offer, e.g. an insect deterrent spray brand symbol showing the \"prohibition sign\" over a mosquito. The [[Ghostbusters]] logo is a fictional example of this, although it uses a mirror image of the no symbol instead of the ISO 3864-1 version.\n\n==International standards==\nWhile the \"prohibition sign\" has been so widely used in advertising and promotions that now many variations of the design (for example, flipped left to right or varied in hue) are recognized by the public and considered acceptable, it is still governed by local and international standards. The standard definition of the no symbol comes from the [[International Organization for Standardization]].\n\nIn 2002, [[ISO 3864|ISO 3864-1]] was published (a revision of a standard first published in 1984). The introduction includes language on the need for using as few words as possible to convey information.\n\nISO 3864-1 sets the rules for the color and shape of safety signage, as well regulating the incorporation of text according to viewing distance and sign size. The range of color and shape defined in this standard for the \"prohibition symbol\" or \"no symbol\" is defined as \"a prohibition surround shape (red circular band with a red slash going from the upper left to the lower right) over the top of a black graphical symbol.\"\n\nSince the standard is not published freely and many examples seen in public diverge from the standard, many symbols and public signs using it have not actually been based on the official standard, but instead on inexact copies or interpretations of signs or symbols seen by each graphic artist. This has led to wide variations in color and dimensions. The most common variations seen are brighter reds than specified in the standard and either a much thinner width for the line and slash, or about the right dimensions but using the same width for the slash as the circle (the standard specifies a width that is 80% as wide as the circle). For example, compare [[:Image:No smoking symbol.png]] (a non-compliant representation) with [[:Image:ProhibitionSign.svg]] (a representation drawn using the ISO standard).\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Bikepath in Nordhorn, Germany.jpg|thumb|A [[shared use path]] in Germany.

Therefore, 35 percent of everything within the outer edge of the \"no symbol\" must be the symbol. Additionally, for printed signs under the UK rules, the width of a \"no symbol\" is set at 80 percent the height of the area to which it is printed.\n\nFor computer display and printing, the symbols are supported in [[Unicode]] by combining elements rather than with individual [[code point]s (see below).\n\n==Uses==\nThe \"prohibition\" symbol is used on [[traffic sign]]s, so that drivers can interpret traffic laws quickly while driving. For example:\n\n* [[File:No Left Turn sign.svg|50px]] No left turn or [[File:MUTCD R3-1.svg|50px]] No right turn\n* [[File:No U Turn sign.svg|50px]] No U-turn\n* [[File:MUTCD R8-3.svg|50px]] No parking (English) or [[File:Mexico road sign SR-22.svg|50px]] ''No estacionarse'' (Spanish)\n* [[File:Japan road sign 302.svg|50px]] Road closed to vehicles (Japan), [[File:Zeichen 250 - Verbot f\u00fcr Fahrzeuge aller Art, StVO 1970.svg|50px]] Road closed to vehicles (Germany, but typical in Europe]] \n\nSometimes the symbol is used to warn drivers who are not driving motorized vehicles of dangers or prohibitions:\n* [[File:Denmark road sign C26.1.svg|50px]], [[File:Vorschriftszeichen 14a.svg|50px]], No horse-riding\n* [[File:MUTCD R5-6.svg|50px]], [[File:France road sign B9b.svg|50px]], No bicycles\n* [[File:MUTCD R9-3.svg|50px]], [[File:UK traffic sign 625.1.svg|50px]], No pedestrians\n\nBy analogy, the sign is used in public places to refer to prohibited actions not having to do with traffic:\n\n* [[File:No smoking symbol.svg|50px]] [[Smoking ban|No smoking]] (with symbol of a lit cigarette)\n* [[File:No littering.svg|50px]] or [[File:Ontario Rc-4.svg|50px]] No [[litter]]ing (with symbol of person littering or of litter)\n* [[File:Badenverbot.svg|50px]] or [[File:Badeverbot quadrat.svg|50px]] No swimming (with symbol of swimmer in water underneath)\n\nIt is also used on packages sent through the mail and sealed boxes of merchandise that are sold in stores.  Using a graphical symbol is useful when the item must be handled by people who may not all understand the same language. For example:\n\n* Breakable; do not drop\n* Keep away from magnetic fields\n\nIn product documentation, this may be accompanied by drawings of the product being threatened by the prohibited items: for instance, a cartoon of a [[floppy disk]] being menaced by horseshoe magnets.\n\nIt is also used on clothing, linens, and other household products to indicate the care, treatment or cleaning of the item. For example:\n\n* Do not iron\n\nAlso, many companies use the \"prohibition sign\" when describing the services they offer, e.g. an insect deterrent spray brand symbol showing the \"prohibition sign\" over a mosquito. The [[Ghostbusters]] logo is a fictional example of this, although it uses a mirror image of the no symbol instead of the ISO 3864-1 version.\n\n==International standards==\nWhile the \"prohibition sign\" has been so widely used in advertising and promotions that now many variations of the design (for example, flipped left to right or varied in hue) are recognized by the public and considered acceptable, it is still governed by local and international standards. The standard definition of the no symbol comes from the [[International Organization for Standardization]].\n\nIn 2002, [[ISO 3864|ISO 3864-1]] was published (a revision of a standard first published in 1984). The introduction includes language on the need for using as few words as possible to convey information.\n\nISO 3864-1 sets the rules for the color and shape of safety signage, as well regulating the incorporation of text according to viewing distance and sign size.

It has been described as \"the modern gateway to Cumbria, the North East and Scotland\",<ref name=\"RSH\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshire-england.co.uk/Richmond.html |title=Richmond and Swaledale History |publisher=Yorkshire-england.co.uk |date= |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> and is a [[Roads in the United Kingdom#Primary destinations|primary destination]] signed from as far away as the [[M6 motorway]], 50 miles away. The junction's name is derived from the fact that it is the point of divergence for traffic coming from [[London]], the [[East Midlands]] and [[Yorkshire]] wishing to continue either to [[Edinburgh]] and eastern [[Scotland]] (along the A1(M)) or to [[Glasgow]] and western Scotland (by taking the A66). The roundabout has also long been '''known''' as Scotch egg, and locally as Scotch Winky or simply just \u2018Winky\u2019.\n\n==Geography==\nThe A1(M) leads north towards [[North East England]] and [[Scotland]], and south towards London. The A66 leads north west towards [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] and the [[M6 motorway]]. There are also three other exits from the junction: the [[A6055]] road north and south, with the southbound side leading to the [[A6108 road|A6108]] towards the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]]. The third exit is towards [[Middleton Tyas]] and [[Croft-on-Tees]] and is a minor road which also provides access to the services.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n[[File:Scotch Corner Hotel. - geograph.org.uk - 159946.jpg|thumb|left|The Scotch Corner Hotel]]\nThe name originated from being the junction where the north\u2013south [[Roman road]] known as \"Dere Street\", which crossed the [[River Tees]] at [[Piercebridge]], met the Roman road which went west through [[Bowes]] and [[Brough, Cumbria|Brough]].<ref name=\"Lloyd\">{{cite news |last=Lloyd |first=Chris |date=12 March 2018 |title=History of Scotch Corner - once the site of a battle between Romans and Brigantes, 2,000 years ago |newspaper=The Northern Echo |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/16081471.history-of-scotch-corner-once-the-site-of-a-battle-between-romans-and-brigantes-2000-years-ago/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313140547/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/16081471.history-of-scotch-corner-once-the-site-of-a-battle-between-romans-and-brigantes-2000-years-ago/ |archive-date=13 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> It is where travellers to eastern Scotland (now via [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]] and/or [[A68 road|A68]]) are separated from travellers to western Scotland (now via [[A66 road|A66]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]]/ [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M)/M74]]).\n\nThe [[Roman Britain|Romans]] were responsible for building the first roads to meet at this point and the site of the original junction is just a few hundred yards away from the modern day intersection. In AD 71 the Romans took control of the North when they defeated the [[Brigantes]], a Northern [[Celt]]ic tribe at the [[Battle of Scotch Corner]].<ref name=\"RSH\"/> There was a major Roman settlement at Scotch Corner, with its own mint.<ref name=\"Lloyd\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Roman treasures found on A1 |date=10 April 2017 |publisher=Highways England, Government of the United Kingdom |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/roman-treasures-found-on-a1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424221117/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/roman-treasures-found-on-a1 |archive-date=24 April 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nThe route now called the A66 was once 'the winter road' from Scotch Corner to [[Glasgow]], by way of [[Carlisle]].

The junction's name is derived from the fact that it is the point of divergence for traffic coming from [[London]], the [[East Midlands]] and [[Yorkshire]] wishing to continue either to [[Edinburgh]] and eastern [[Scotland]] (along the A1(M)) or to [[Glasgow]] and western Scotland (by taking the A66).\n\n==Geography==\nThe A1(M) leads north towards [[North East England]] and [[Scotland]], and south towards London. The A66 leads north west towards [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] and the [[M6 motorway]]. There are also three other exits from the junction: the [[A6055]] road north and south, with the southbound side leading to the [[A6108 road|A6108]] towards the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]].

The E520, E521 and C521 were re-introduced under the Inspiron line under the names Inspiron 530, 531, 530s and 531s, with a revised case design.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:Dell Dimension C521.jpg|thumb|Dell Dimension C521]]\n{{Expand list|date=January 2019}}\n\n*'''Dimension  9xx Series''' - 900\n*'''Dimension 1xxx Series''' - 1000, 1100\n*'''Dimension 2xxx Series''' - 2010, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2300C, 2350, 2400, 2400C\n*'''Dimension 3xxx Series''' - 3000, 3100, 3100c, 3400, 3800\n*'''Dimension 4xxx Series''' - 4100, 4200, 4300, 4300S, 4400, 4500, 4500C, 4500S, 4550, 4600, 4600C, 4700, 4700C, 4700 MCE\n*'''Dimension 5xxx Series''' - 5000, 5100, 5150, 5150C, 5200, 5200C\n*'''Dimension 8xxx Series''' - 8100, 8200, 8250, 8300, 8300N, 8400, 8400 MCE\n*'''Dimension 9xxx Series''' - 9100, 9150, 9200, 9200C\n*'''Dimension B Series''' - B110\n*'''Dimension C Series''' - C521\n*'''Dimension D Series''' - DE051\n*'''Dimension E Series''' - E310, E510, E520, E521, E530\n*'''Dimension J Series''' \n*'''Dimension L Series''' (Lxxx is MHz; R is PIII; C, CX, CXE are Celeron)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dmum/specs.htm |title=Product Support |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022532/http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dmum/specs.htm |archivedate=2012-07-08 }}</ref>\n**L___c - L400c, L433c, L466c, L500c\n**L___cx - L433cx, L500cx, L533cx, L566cx, L600cx, L633cx, L667cx, L700cx, L733cx, L800cx\n**L___cxe - L700cxe, L800cxe\n**L___r - L500r, L550r, L600r, L667r, L733r, L800r, L866r, L933r, L1000r, L1100r\n*'''Dimension M Series''' - M166a, M200a, M233a\n*'''Dimension P Series''' - P100a, P133a, P166a, P75t, P90t, P100t, P120t, P133t, P133v, P166v, P200v\n*'''Dimension V Series''' - V333, V350, V400, V450, V333c, V400c, V433c, V466c<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/dwill/Specs.htm |title=Specifications: Dell\u2122 Dimension\u2122 Vxxx and Vxxxc Systems |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020404133108/http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/dwill/Specs.htm |archivedate=2002-04-04 }}</ref>\n*'''Dimension XPS Series'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.dell.com/us/en/docs/index.asp?cc=12&ct=84 |title=User's Guides |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202075817/http://support.dell.com/us/en/docs/index.asp?cc=12&ct=84 |archivedate=2001-12-02 }}</ref>\n**XPS B - B866, B933, B1000, B533r, B600r, B667r, B733r, B800r, B866r, B933r, B1000r \n**XPS D - D233, D266, D300, D333\n**XPS H - H233, H266\n**XPS M - M166s, M200s, M233s\n**XPS P - P60, P75, P90, P100, P90c, P100c, P120c, P133c, P150c, P166c, P133s, P166s, P200s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/dta/XPSPCMT/00000001.htm |title=Specifications: Specifications: Dell Dimension XPS P90c/P100c/P120c/P133c/P150c/P166c |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040821125820/http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/dta/XPSPCMT/00000001.htm |archivedate=2004-08-21 }}</ref>\n**XPS Pro - Pro150, Pro200, Pro150n, Pro180n, Pro200n\n**XPS R - R350, R400, R450\n**XPS T - T450, T500, T550, T600, T600r, T650r, T700r, T750r, T800r, T850r\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===9xx series===\n{| class =\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:12em\" | Model\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Released\n! rowspan=2 | [[Chipset]]\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Processor type\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Memory\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Video\n! rowspan=2 | [[Audio codec]]\n! rowspan=2 | [[Network card]]\n! rowspan=2 | Expansion Bus\n\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Physical\n|-\n!

The E520, E521 and C521 were re-introduced under the Inspiron line under the names Inspiron 530, 531, 530s and 531s, with a revised case design.\n\n==Models==\n[[File:Dell Dimension C521.jpg|thumb|Dell Dimension C521]]\n{{Expand list|date=January 2019}}\n\n*'''Dimension  9xx Series''' - 900\n*'''Dimension 1xxx Series''' - 1000, 1100\n*'''Dimension 2xxx Series''' - 2010, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2300C, 2350, 2400, 2400C\n*'''Dimension 3xxx Series''' - 3000, 3100, 3100c, 3400, 3800\n*'''Dimension 4xxx Series''' - 4100, 4200, 4300, 4300S, 4400, 4500, 4500C, 4500S, 4550, 4600, 4600C, 4700, 4700C, 4700 MCE\n*'''Dimension 5xxx Series''' - 5000, 5100, 5150, 5150C, 5200, 5200C\n*'''Dimension 8xxx Series''' - 8100, 8200, 8250, 8300, 8300N, 8400, 8400 MCE\n*'''Dimension 9xxx Series''' - 9100, 9150, 9200, 9200C\n*'''Dimension B Series''' - B110\n*'''Dimension C Series''' - C521\n*'''Dimension D Series''' - DE051\n*'''Dimension E Series''' - E310, E510, E520, E521, E530\n*'''Dimension J Series''' \n*'''Dimension L Series''' (Lxxx is MHz; R is PIII; C, CX, CXE are Celeron)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dmum/specs.htm |title=Product Support |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708022532/http://docs.us.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dmum/specs.htm |archivedate=2012-07-08 }}</ref>\n**L___c - L400c, L433c, L466c, L500c\n**L___cx - L433cx, L500cx, L533cx, L566cx, L600cx, L633cx, L667cx, L700cx, L733cx, L800cx\n**L___cxe - L700cxe, L800cxe\n**L___r - L500r, L550r, L600r, L667r, L733r, L800r, L866r, L933r, L1000r, L1100r\n*'''Dimension M Series''' - M166a, M200a, M233a\n*'''Dimension P Series''' - P100a, P133a, P166a, P75t, P90t, P100t, P120t, P133t, P133v, P166v, P200v\n*'''Dimension V Series''' - V333, V350, V400, V450, V333c, V400c, V433c, V466c<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/dwill/Specs.htm |title=Specifications: Dell\u2122 Dimension\u2122 Vxxx and Vxxxc Systems |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020404133108/http://docs.us.dell.com/docs/systems/dwill/Specs.htm |archivedate=2002-04-04 }}</ref>\n*'''Dimension XPS Series'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.dell.com/us/en/docs/index.asp?cc=12&ct=84 |title=User's Guides |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202075817/http://support.dell.com/us/en/docs/index.asp?cc=12&ct=84 |archivedate=2001-12-02 }}</ref>\n**XPS B - B866, B933, B1000, B533r, B600r, B667r, B733r, B800r, B866r, B933r, B1000r \n**XPS D - D233, D266, D300, D333\n**XPS H - H233, H266\n**XPS M - M166s, M200s, M233s\n**XPS P - P60, P75, P90, P100, P90c, P100c, P120c, P133c, P150c, P166c, P133s, P166s, P200s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/dta/XPSPCMT/00000001.htm |title=Specifications: Specifications: Dell Dimension XPS P90c/P100c/P120c/P133c/P150c/P166c |author=Dell US |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040821125820/http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/dta/XPSPCMT/00000001.htm |archivedate=2004-08-21 }}</ref>\n**XPS Pro - Pro150, Pro200, Pro150n, Pro180n, Pro200n\n**XPS R - R350, R400, R450\n**XPS T - T450, T500, T550, T600, T600r, T650r, T700r, T750r, T800r, T850r\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===9xx series===\n{| class =\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:12em\" | Model\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Released\n! rowspan=2 | [[Chipset]]\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Processor type\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Memory\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Video\n! rowspan=2 | [[Audio codec]]\n! rowspan=2 | [[Network card]]\n! rowspan=2 | Expansion Bus\n\n! colspan=4 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Physical\n|-\n!

It was released on 16 January 1989 on [[Virgin Records]]. Despite including the US Adult Contemporary Chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", it met with little commercial or critical success.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1986, Cutting Crew had had a number-one US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\", the top 10 hit \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", and another Top 40 song, \"One for the Mockingbird\". All three were released to varying levels of chart success in their native UK and across much of Europe. However, their debut album, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]],'' was less successful, failing to reach the top 10 in the US and the top 40 in the UK. Executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering a follow-up album that both was popular on its own and had multiple radio-friendly singles lined up.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>.

We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band.
