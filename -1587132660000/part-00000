Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] and [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] issue the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow.

The expedition discovered the [[Mariana Islands]] and the [[Philippines]] and claimed them for Spain. Although Magellan died there, one of his ships, the ''Victoria'', made it back to Spain by continuing westward.\n[[File:Puerto_de_Acapulco_Boot_1628.png|thumb|left|[[Acapulco]] in 1628, Mexican terminus of the Manila galleon]]\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta Tornaviaje.jpg|thumb|Northerly trade route as used by eastbound Manila galleons]]\nIn order to settle and trade with these islands from the Americas, an eastward maritime return path was necessary. [[Trinidad (ship)|The first ship to try this]] a few years later failed. In 1529, [[\u00c1lvaro de Saavedra Cer\u00f3n]] also tried sailing east from the Philippines, but could not find the eastward winds across the Pacific. In 1543, [[Bernardo de la Torre]] also failed. In 1542, however, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] helped pave the way by sailing north from Mexico to explore the Pacific coast, reaching as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], just north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].\n\nThe Manila-Acapulco galleon trade finally began when Spanish navigators [[Alonso de Arellano]] and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] discovered the eastward return route in 1565. Sailing as part of the expedition commanded by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] to conquer the Philippines in 1565, Arellano and Urdaneta were given the task of finding a return route. Reasoning that the [[trade winds]] of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did, they had to sail north to the [[38th parallel north]], off the east coast of Japan, before catching the eastward-blowing winds (\"[[westerlies]]\") that would take them back across the Pacific.\n\nReaching the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of North America]], Urdaneta's ship the ''San Pedro'' hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], [[California]], then followed the coast south to [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]] and later to [[Acapulco]], arriving on October 8, 1565.<ref name=\"pg18\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z26YL407SkC&pg=PA152 |author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical atlas of the North Pacific Ocean: maps of discovery and scientific exploration, 1500\u20132000|page=18|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|year=2001|isbn=9781550548655}}</ref> Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned.

After capturing a Spanish ship heading for Manila, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from Manila to Acapulco.

According to historian William Lytle Schurz, \"They generally made their landfall well down the coast, somewhere between [[Point Conception]] and [[Cabo San Lucas|Cape San Lucas]]&nbsp;... After all, these were preeminently merchant ships, and the business of exploration lay outside their field, though chance discoveries were welcomed\".<ref name=Schurz1917>Schurz 1917, p.107-108</ref>\n\nThe first motivation for land exploration of present-day California was to scout out possible way-stations for the seaworn Manila galleons on the last leg of their journey. Early proposals came to little, but in 1769, the [[Portola expedition]] established ports at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] (which became the administrative center of [[Alta California]]), providing safe harbors for returning Manila galleons.\n\nIn Manila, the safety of ocean crossings was commended to the virgin [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]] in masses held by the Archbishop of Manila. If the expedition was successful the voyagers would go to the La Ermita (church) to pay homage, and offer gold and other precious gems or jewelries from Hispanic countries, to the image of the virgin. So it came to be that the Virgin was named the \"Queen of the Galleons\".\n{{clear}}\n\n==The Manila Galleon and California==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nMonterey, California was about two months and three weeks out from Manila in the 18th century, and the galleon tended to stop there 40 days before arriving in Manila.  Galleons stopped in Monterey prior to California's settlement by the Spanish in 1769, however visits become regular between 1777 and 1794 because the Crown ordered the galleon to stop in Monterey. \n\n==Spice trade==\n[[Image:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|White represents the route of the Manila Galleons in the Pacific and the [[Spanish treasure fleet|flota]] in the Atlantic.

Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port.<ref>Schurz, William Lytle. ''The Manila Galleon'', 1939. P 193.</ref> The Manila trade became so lucrative that [[Seville]] merchants petitioned king [[Philip II of Spain]] to protect the monopoly of the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]] based in Seville. This led to the passing of a decree in 1593 that set a limit of two ships sailing each year from either port, with one kept in reserve in Acapulco and one in Manila. An \"armada\" or armed escort of galleons, was also approved. Due to official attempts at controlling the galleon trade, contraband and understating of ships' cargo became widespread.<ref name=\"CharlesMann\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqaMEWNvsJQC|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|pages=123\u2013163|author=[[Charles C.

The [[Spanish ship Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1751)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']] was 51.5 m long. Most of the ships were built in the Philippines and only eight in Mexico. The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade ended in 1815, a few years before Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. After this, the Spanish Crown took direct control of the Philippines, and governed directly from Madrid. Sea transport became easier in the mid-19th century upon the invention of steam power ships and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], which reduced the travel time from Spain to the Philippines to 40 days.\n\nThe galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of [[Fujian]] who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, [[porcelain]], [[ivory]], [[lacquerware]], processed [[silk]] cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain.<ref name=\"Mejia\"/>\n\nGalleons transported the goods to be sold in the Americas, namely in [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] as well as in European markets. [[East Asia]] trading primarily functioned on a [[silver standard]] due to Ming China's use of [[sycee|silver ingots]] as a medium of exchange.

It also avoided stopping over at ports controlled by competing powers, such as Portugal and the Netherlands. From the early days of exploration, the Spanish knew that the American continent was much narrower across the [[Geography of Panama|Panamanian isthmus]] than across Mexico. They tried to establish a regular land crossing there, but the thick jungle and [[malaria]] made it impractical.\n\nIt took at least four months to sail across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from Manila to Acapulco, and the galleons were the main link between the Philippines and the viceregal capital at [[Mexico City]] and thence to Spain itself. Many of the so-called \"Kastilas\" or Spaniards in the Philippines were actually of Mexican descent, and the Hispanic culture of the Philippines is somewhat close to Mexican culture.<ref>Guevarra, Rudy P.

Ships pages were children who entered service mostly at age 8, many orphans or poor taken from the streets of Seville, Mexico and Manila. Apprentices were older than the pages and if successful would be certified a sailor at age 20. Because mortality rates were high with ships arriving in Manila with a majority of their crew often dead from starvation, disease and scurvy, especially in the early years, Spanish officials in Manila found it difficult to find men to crew their ships to return to Acapulco. Many ''indios'' of Filipino and Southeast Asian origin made up the majority of the crew. Other crew were made up of deportees and criminals from Spain and the colonies. Many criminals were sentenced to serve as crew on royal ships. Less than a third of the crew was Spanish and they usually held key positions onboard the galleon. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Leon-Guerrero |first1=Jillette |title=Manila Galleon Crew Members |url=https://www.guampedia.com/manila-galleon-crew-members/ |website=Guampedia |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Possible discovery of Hawaii==\n{{further|Filipinos in Hawaii|Paniolo}}\nFor 250 years, hundreds of Manila galleons traveled from present-day Mexico to the Philippines, with their route taking them south of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. And yet, no historical records of any contact between the two cultures exist. British historian [[Henry Kamen]] maintains that the Spanish did not have the ability to properly explore the Pacific Ocean, and were not capable of finding the islands which lay at a latitude 20\u00b0 north of the westbound galleon route and its currents.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| authorlink = Henry Kamen| title = Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492\u20131763| publisher = [[HarperCollins]]| year = 2004| isbn = 0060932643}}</ref> However, Spanish activity in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. Spanish expeditions discovered [[Guam]], the [[Marianas]], the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] in the South Pacific. Spanish navigators also discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos during their search for [[Terra Australis]] in the 17th century.\n[[File:Mauna Kea carte.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Pacific Ocean with [[Mauna Kea]] highlighted]]\nThis navigational activity poses questions as to whether Spanish explorers did arrive in the Hawaiian Islands two centuries before Captain [[James Cook]]'s first visit in 1778. [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 with a Spanish sailor named Ivan Gaetan or Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seem to describe either the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands in 1555.<ref name=Kane>{{cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| authorlink = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawai\u02bb Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25\u201332| isbn = 0-8248-1829-6}}</ref> If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been one of the first Europeans to find the islands.\n[[File:Manilajf9742 16.JPG|thumb|The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Memorial at Plaza Mexico in Intramuros, Manila.]]\nThe westward route from Mexico passed south of Hawaii, making a short stopover in Guam before heading for Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers, and to avoid Dutch and English pirates. Due to this policy of discretion, if the Spanish did find Hawaii during their voyages, they would not have published their findings and the discovery would have remained unknown. From Gaetano's account, the Hawaiian islands were not known to have any valuable resources, so the Spanish would not have made an effort to settle them.<ref name=Kane /> This happened in the case of the Marianas and the Carolines, which were not effectively settled until the second half of the 17th century. Spanish archives{{when|date=March 2017}} contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands ([[longitude problem|reliable methods of determining longitude]] were not developed until the mid-eighteenth century). In this manuscript, the Island of [[Maui]] is named \"La Desgraciada\" (the unhappy, or unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is named \"La Mesa\" (the table). Islands resembling [[Kahoolawe]], [[Lanai]], and [[Molokai]] are named \"Los Monjes\" (the monks).<ref>Hawaii National Park.

According to Hawaiian writer [[Herb Kawainui Kane]], one of these stories:\n<blockquote>concerned seven foreigners who landed eight generations earlier at [[Kealakekua Bay]] in a painted boat with an awning or canopy over the stern. They were dressed in clothing of white and yellow, and one wore a sword at his side and a feather in his hat. On landing, they kneeled down in prayer. The [[Hawaiians]], most helpful to those who were most helpless, received them kindly. The strangers ultimately married into the families of chiefs, but their names could not be included in genealogies\".<ref name=Kane /></blockquote>\n\nSome scholars, particularly American, have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.<ref>By Oliver, Douglas L.

The first successful round trips were made by Urdaneta and by [[Alonso de Arellano]] that year. The route lasted until 1815 when the [[Mexican War of Independence]] broke out. The Manila galleons sailed the Pacific for 250 years, bringing to the Americas cargoes of luxury goods such as spices and porcelain, in exchange for silver. The route also created a cultural exchange that shaped the identities and culture of the countries involved.\n\nIn 2015, the Philippines and Mexico began preparations for the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], with backing from Spain. Spain has also suggested the tri-national nomination of the Archives on the Manila-Acapulco Galleons in the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]].\n[[File:Reception_of_the_Manila_Galleon_by_the_Chamorro_in_the_Ladrones_Islands,_ca._1590.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Manila Galleon (c. 1590 [[Boxer Codex]])]]\n\n==Discovery of the route==\n[[File:Urdaneta marinela txikia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Explorer Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]]\n[[File:Iberian_mare_clausum_claims.svg|thumb|Iberian ''[[mare clausum]]'' claims during the [[Age of Discovery]].]]\nIn 1521, a Spanish expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed west across the Pacific using the westward [[trade winds]]. The expedition discovered the [[Mariana Islands]] and the [[Philippines]] and claimed them for Spain. Although Magellan died there, one of his ships, the ''Victoria'', made it back to Spain by continuing westward.\n[[File:Puerto_de_Acapulco_Boot_1628.png|thumb|left|[[Acapulco]] in 1628, Mexican terminus of the Manila galleon]]\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta Tornaviaje.jpg|thumb|Northerly trade route as used by eastbound Manila galleons]]\nIn order to settle and trade with these islands from the Americas, an eastward maritime return path was necessary. [[Trinidad (ship)|The first ship to try this]] a few years later failed. In 1529, [[\u00c1lvaro de Saavedra Cer\u00f3n]] also tried sailing east from the Philippines, but could not find the eastward winds across the Pacific. In 1543, [[Bernardo de la Torre]] also failed. In 1542, however, [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] helped pave the way by sailing north from Mexico to explore the Pacific coast, reaching as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], just north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]].\n\nThe Manila-Acapulco galleon trade finally began when Spanish navigators [[Alonso de Arellano]] and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] discovered the eastward return route in 1565. Sailing as part of the expedition commanded by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] to conquer the Philippines in 1565, Arellano and Urdaneta were given the task of finding a return route. Reasoning that the [[trade winds]] of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did, they had to sail north to the [[38th parallel north]], off the east coast of Japan, before catching the eastward-blowing winds (\"[[westerlies]]\") that would take them back across the Pacific.\n\nReaching the [[History of the west coast of North America|west coast of North America]], Urdaneta's ship the ''San Pedro'' hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], [[California]], then followed the coast south to [[San Blas, Nayarit|San Blas]] and later to [[Acapulco]], arriving on October 8, 1565.<ref name=\"pg18\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z26YL407SkC&pg=PA152 |author=Derek Hayes|title=Historical atlas of the North Pacific Ocean: maps of discovery and scientific exploration, 1500\u20132000|page=18|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|year=2001|isbn=9781550548655}}</ref> Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned.

According to historian William Lytle Schurz, \"They generally made their landfall well down the coast, somewhere between [[Point Conception]] and [[Cabo San Lucas|Cape San Lucas]]&nbsp;...

Early proposals came to little, but in 1769, the [[Portola expedition]] established ports at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] (which became the administrative center of [[Alta California]]), providing safe harbors for returning Manila galleons.\n\nIn Manila, the safety of ocean crossings was commended to the virgin [[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]] in masses held by the Archbishop of Manila.

This led to the passing of a decree in 1593 that set a limit of two ships sailing each year from either port, with one kept in reserve in Acapulco and one in Manila. An \"armada\" or armed escort of galleons, was also approved.

The [[Spanish ship Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1751)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']] was 51.5 m long. Most of the ships were built in the Philippines and only eight in Mexico. The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade ended in 1815, a few years before Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. After this, the Spanish Crown took direct control of the Philippines, and governed directly from Madrid. Sea transport became easier in the mid-19th century upon the invention of steam power ships and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]], which reduced the travel time from Spain to the Philippines to 40 days.\n\nThe galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of [[Fujian]] who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, [[porcelain]], [[ivory]], [[lacquerware]], processed [[silk]] cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain.<ref name=\"Mejia\"/>\n\nGalleons transported the goods to be sold in the Americas, namely in [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] as well as in European markets.

It also avoided stopping over at ports controlled by competing powers, such as Portugal and the Netherlands. From the early days of exploration, the Spanish knew that the American continent was much narrower across the [[Geography of Panama|Panamanian isthmus]] than across Mexico. They tried to establish a regular land crossing there, but the thick jungle and [[malaria]] made it impractical.\n\nIt took at least four months to sail across the [[Pacific Ocean]] from Manila to Acapulco, and the galleons were the main link between the Philippines and the viceregal capital at [[Mexico City]] and thence to Spain itself. Many of the so-called \"Kastilas\" or Spaniards in the Philippines were actually of Mexican descent, and the Hispanic culture of the Philippines is somewhat close to Mexican culture.<ref>Guevarra, Rudy P.

Ships pages were children who entered service mostly at age 8, many orphans or poor taken from the streets of Seville, Mexico and Manila. Apprentices were older than the pages and if successful would be certified a sailor at age 20. Because mortality rates were high with ships arriving in Manila with a majority of their crew often dead from starvation, disease and scurvy, especially in the early years, Spanish officials in Manila found it difficult to find men to crew their ships to return to Acapulco. Many ''indios'' of Filipino and Southeast Asian origin made up the majority of the crew. Other crew were made up of deportees and criminals from Spain and the colonies. Many criminals were sentenced to serve as crew on royal ships. Less than a third of the crew was Spanish and they usually held key positions onboard the galleon. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Leon-Guerrero |first1=Jillette |title=Manila Galleon Crew Members |url=https://www.guampedia.com/manila-galleon-crew-members/ |website=Guampedia |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Possible discovery of Hawaii==\n{{further|Filipinos in Hawaii|Paniolo}}\nFor 250 years, hundreds of Manila galleons traveled from present-day Mexico to the Philippines, with their route taking them south of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. And yet, no historical records of any contact between the two cultures exist. British historian [[Henry Kamen]] maintains that the Spanish did not have the ability to properly explore the Pacific Ocean, and were not capable of finding the islands which lay at a latitude 20\u00b0 north of the westbound galleon route and its currents.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| authorlink = Henry Kamen| title = Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492\u20131763| publisher = [[HarperCollins]]| year = 2004| isbn = 0060932643}}</ref> However, Spanish activity in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. Spanish expeditions discovered [[Guam]], the [[Marianas]], the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as [[Tuvalu]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[New Guinea]] in the South Pacific. Spanish navigators also discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos during their search for [[Terra Australis]] in the 17th century.\n[[File:Mauna Kea carte.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Pacific Ocean with [[Mauna Kea]] highlighted]]\nThis navigational activity poses questions as to whether Spanish explorers did arrive in the Hawaiian Islands two centuries before Captain [[James Cook]]'s first visit in 1778. [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 with a Spanish sailor named Ivan Gaetan or Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seem to describe either the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands in 1555.<ref name=Kane>{{cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| authorlink = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawai\u02bb Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25\u201332| isbn = 0-8248-1829-6}}</ref> If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been one of the first Europeans to find the islands.\n[[File:Manilajf9742 16.JPG|thumb|The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Memorial at Plaza Mexico in Intramuros, Manila.]]\nThe westward route from Mexico passed south of Hawaii, making a short stopover in Guam before heading for Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers, and to avoid Dutch and English pirates. Due to this policy of discretion, if the Spanish did find Hawaii during their voyages, they would not have published their findings and the discovery would have remained unknown. From Gaetano's account, the Hawaiian islands were not known to have any valuable resources, so the Spanish would not have made an effort to settle them.<ref name=Kane /> This happened in the case of the Marianas and the Carolines, which were not effectively settled until the second half of the 17th century. Spanish archives{{when|date=March 2017}} contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands ([[longitude problem|reliable methods of determining longitude]] were not developed until the mid-eighteenth century). In this manuscript, the Island of [[Maui]] is named \"La Desgraciada\" (the unhappy, or unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is named \"La Mesa\" (the table). Islands resembling [[Kahoolawe]], [[Lanai]], and [[Molokai]] are named \"Los Monjes\" (the monks).<ref>Hawaii National Park.

According to Hawaiian writer [[Herb Kawainui Kane]], one of these stories:\n<blockquote>concerned seven foreigners who landed eight generations earlier at [[Kealakekua Bay]] in a painted boat with an awning or canopy over the stern. They were dressed in clothing of white and yellow, and one wore a sword at his side and a feather in his hat. On landing, they kneeled down in prayer. The [[Hawaiians]], most helpful to those who were most helpless, received them kindly. The strangers ultimately married into the families of chiefs, but their names could not be included in genealogies\".<ref name=Kane /></blockquote>\n\nSome scholars, particularly American, have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.<ref>By Oliver, Douglas L.

In countries adopting the \"Monday-first\" convention it is the fifth [[Week-day names#Numbered days of the week|day of the week]]. In countries that adopt the \"[[Names of the days of the week|Sunday-first]]\" convention, it is the sixth and penultimate day of the week.\n\nIn most Western countries, Friday is the fifth and final day of the working week. In some other countries, for example the [[Maldives]], Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second. In [[Iran]] Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week. [[Bahrain]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]] also followed this convention until they changed to a Friday\u2013Saturday weekend: on 1 September 2006 in [[Bahrain]] and the UAE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article697051.ece|title=Login|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> and a year later in [[Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fulbrighter-in-kuwait.blogspot.com/2007/05/kuwait-changes-to-friday-saturday.html|title=Expositions of Arabia: Kuwait Changes to Friday-Saturday Weekend|first=Nabil|last=Wilf|date=29 May 2007|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> In [[Iran]], Thursday and Friday are weekend days.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:FriggSpinning.jpg|right|thumb|[[Frigg]] spinning the clouds, by [[John Charles Dollman]]]]\nThe name ''Friday'' comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|Fr\u012b\u0121ed\u00e6\u0121}}'', meaning the \"day of [[Frige (Anglo-Saxon goddess)|Frige]]\", a result of an old convention associating the Germanic goddess [[Frigg]] with the Roman goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], with whom the day is associated in many different cultures. The same holds for ''{{lang|goh|Fr\u012batag}}'' in [[Old High German]], ''{{lang|de|Freitag}}'' in Modern [[German language|German]], and ''{{lang|nl|vrijdag}}'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].\n\nThe expected cognate name in [[Old Norse]] would be ''{{lang|non|friggjar-dagr}}''. However, the name of Friday in Old Norse is ''{{lang|non|frj\u00e1-dagr}}'' instead, indicating a loan of the week-day names from [[Low German]].<ref>Hermann Paul, ''{{lang|de|Grundriss der germanischen philologie}}'', vol 3,  1900, p. 369.</ref> The modern Scandinavian form is ''{{lang|sv|fredag}}'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Danish language|Danish]], meaning [[Freyja]]'s day. [[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis|The distinction between Freyja and Frigg]] in some Germanic mythologies is contested.\n[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Friday is associated in many cultures with the love goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and the [[Venus|planet named for her]].]]\n\nThe word for Friday in most [[Romance languages]] is derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|dies Veneris}}'' or \"day of Venus\" (a translation of Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Aphrod\u012b\u0301t\u0113s h\u0113m\u00e9ra}}'', {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u1fd1\u0301\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f29\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1}}), such as ''{{lang|fr|vendredi}}'' in [[French language|French]], ''venres'' in [[Galician language|Galician]], ''{{lang|ca|divendres}}'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''{{lang|co|vennari}}'' in [[Corsican language|Corsican]], ''{{lang|it|venerd\u00ec}}'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''{{lang|ro|vineri}}'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and ''{{lang|es|viernes}}'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and influencing the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] ''{{lang|fil|biyernes}}'' or ''{{lang|fil|byernes}}'', and the [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] ''{{lang|ch|betnes}}''. This is also reflected in the [[p-Celtic]] [[Welsh language]] as ''{{lang|cy|Gwener}}''.<!-- The \"dydd\" portion isn't needed here as the NAME of the day is \"Gwener\", c.f. \"nos Wener\" (Friday night), \"prynhawn Gwener\" (Friday afternoon), \"bore Gwener\" (Friday morning), \"dydd Gwener\" (Friday daytime), hence why the \"dydd\" is not capitalized. The \"dydd\" portion is not included in the etymology of \"Gwener\" so \"Gwener\" is sufficient here. -->\n\nAn exception is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], also a [[Romance languages|Romance language]], which uses the word ''{{lang|pt|sexta-feira}}'', meaning \"sixth day of liturgical celebration\", derived from the Latin ''{{lang|la|feria sexta}}'' used in religious texts where it was not allowed to consecrate days to pagan gods. \n\nIn [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], the word ''{{lang|sc|chen\u00e0pura}}'' also figures as an exception among all the other Romance languages, since it is derived from Latin ''{{lang|la|cena pura}}''.

Fasting on Fridays entails [[abstinence]] from meat or meat products (i.e., quadrupeds), [[poultry]], and [[dairy products]] (as well as fish). Unless a [[feast day]] occurs on a Friday, the Orthodox also abstain from using oil in their cooking and from alcoholic beverages (there is some debate over whether abstention from oil involves all [[cooking oil]] or only [[olive oil]]). On particularly important feast days, fish may also be permitted.

The same holds for ''{{lang|goh|Fr\u012batag}}'' in [[Old High German]], ''{{lang|de|Freitag}}'' in Modern [[German language|German]], and ''{{lang|nl|vrijdag}}'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].\n\nThe expected cognate name in [[Old Norse]] would be ''{{lang|non|friggjar-dagr}}''.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

The house is set up as a night club, where a seasoned band of jazz performers plays music of a quality rarely heard in the theatre. Sean Power's script is cleverly structured so that Holiday's patter from the mike alternates with bits of gossip passed on by other characters - friends, lovers, managers - and the audience gets a sense of Holiday's life without any of the distracting speeches or flashbacks common to this kind of show. It is, of course, a sad evening in the end, but there's a fierce energy and intelligence running through the production that makes you understand Holiday's desire and her gift, as well as her pain. Bemshi Shearer, as Holiday, is ravishing, and the rest of the cast are up to her standard (Kwana Martinez does a brilliant comic turn as a cigarette girl with ambitions).\"\n\n===See Also===\n*[[Salvatore Antonio]]\n*[[Allan Hawco]]\n*[[Fran\u00e7ois Papineau]]\n*[[Luke Kirby]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theseanpower.com Official website]\n*{{IMDb name|id=0694463|name=Sean Power}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Power, Sean}}\n[[Category:Irish male stage actors]]\n[[Category:Italian male stage actors]]\n[[Category:Canadian male stage actors]]\n[[Category:American male stage actors]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:National Theatre School of Canada alumni]]\n[[Category:Male actors from Alberta]]\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n", "name_user": "Vanisaac", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correcting spelling: aka->a.k.a.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Power_(actor)"}
