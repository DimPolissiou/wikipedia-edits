He is often called Mukku Thimmana (Thimmana of the nose) after his celebrated poem on a woman's nose.\n\n==Biography==\nThimmana is believed to be from [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Anantapur]] and was born to Singanna and Thimmamaamba. He lived in a subkingdom of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], whose princess was [[Tirumala Devi]]. Later tradition imagines Nandi Timmana as one of the so-called asta-dig-gajas, the eight elephants of the cardinal directions, who supposedly graced the court of Krsnadevar\u0101ya at the apogee of the Vijayanagara period. Although this set of eight is probably a later (seventeenth-century) invention, Timmana's presence at Krsnadevar\u0101ya's court is historically verified. The poet dedicated his work, P\u0101rij\u0101t\u00e2paharanamu, to this king.

The government of the province of Alberta is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[unicameral]] legislature\u2014the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], which consists of 87 members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly].</ref>  The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and usually draws the members of Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The legislative powers in the province however, lie with the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. Its government resembles that of the other Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. The capital of the province is [[Edmonton]], where the [[Alberta Legislative Building]] is located. Government is conducted after the [[Westminster System|Westminster model]]. \n\n==Government of Alberta==\n{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}\n\n[[File:JasperRoadEdmt.jpg|thumb|alt=Image looking west down Jasper Avenue showing the major financial centre in Edmonton|[[Jasper Avenue]], a hub of major offices and the financial centres in Edmonton.]]\n\nThe executive powers in the province lie with the Premier of Alberta and the Cabinet of Alberta or the Executive Council of Alberta. The legislative powers in the province lie with the [[Legislature of Alberta|Legislature]], which consists of two components: the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen]], represented by the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nThe Executive Council of Alberta is officially headed by the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], as representative of the [[Monarchy in Alberta|Queen in Right of Alberta]] and is referred to as the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Jason Kenney]], who was sworn in as the 18th premier on April 30, 2019.\n\n==Legislative powers==\nThe Legislative Assembly meets in the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] in the provincial capital, [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe Legislative Assembly consists of 87 members, elected [[first past the post]] from single-member [[electoral district]]s.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly]</ref> The [[30th Alberta Legislature|current Legislature]] is the 30th, since the [[Alberta Act, 1905|creation of the province]] in 1905.\n\nThe last election was held on [[2019 Alberta general election|April 16, 2019]], and returned a majority parliament controlled by the [[United Conservative Party]] commonly abbreviated to 'UCP'.\n\n==Executive powers==\n\n===Executive Council of Alberta===\nTypically, although not necessarily consisting of members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, the Cabinet of Alberta is similar in structure and role to the [[Cabinet of Canada]]. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, as representative of the Queen in Right of Alberta, heads the council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the Premier of Alberta and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], but this is not always the case. In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, though it is important to note that, despite appearances of the contrary, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |year=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714043622/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAs at the federal level the most important Cabinet post after that of the leader is Minister of Finance.

The usual one is \"Alberta X\", (e.g. [[Alberta Education]]) the older style is \"Ministry of X\" (e.g. [[Ministry of Finance]]). The newer style without the word \"ministry\" resembles the federal government's [[Federal Identity Program]] and the federal naming scheme, except in reverse order. Federal ministries and departments are usually \"X Canada\" (e.g. [[Environment Canada]]).\n\nWith every new cabinet ministries can be created or disbanded, renamed or gain or lose responsibilities. Some ministries such as finance or health are common to all provincial governments and are comparable to similar ministries or departments at the federal level or indeed even in other countries. However, some ministries are quite distinct to Alberta, such as the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development which oversees the management of public lands.\n\nThese are the current ministries {{As of|2015|lc=on}}, listed alphabetically, with a short description and any notes to changes to that ministry's mandate.\n\n{|table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" colspan\"300\"|Ministry\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Notes\n|-\n|Indigenous Relations\n|Created 2008.

Non-renewable resource revenue provided the government with 24 percent of its revenue in 2010\u201311 with about the same coming from individual income tax, 14 per cent from grants from the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]], and about eight percent coming from both corporations and the government's own business activities. (source: the Government of Alberta website) Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (''see also [[Sales taxes in Canada]]'').\n\nGovernment revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name=\"Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength\">{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503001735/http://alberta.ca/budget2008/|archivedate=May 3, 2008|title=Budget 2009, Building on Our Strength|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%).

Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] (and its predecessors, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party and the United Farmers of Alberta). A fourth party, the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], which began as a radical monetary reform movement and government but after 1944 governed in a right-wing Christian fundamentalist style, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell into powerlessness and disfavour after Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Progressive Conservatives were in government until 2015, when the NDP was elected with a large majority of the seats.\n\nOnly five parties have governed Alberta in the 110 years of its existence as a province: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015, and the NDP from 2015 on.\n\nAlberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. There are several currently active groups promoting the independence of Alberta.\n\nIn the [[2008 Alberta general election|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the Alberta Liberal Party was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two Alberta New Democratic Party members were elected.<ref name=\"2008 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308170551/http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|title=2008 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nApril 23, 2012 [[2012 Alberta general election|election]] returned the Progressive Conservative Party to government, making leader [[Alison Redford]] Alberta's first female premier.<ref name=\"2012 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/albertavotes2012/story/2012/04/23/albertavotes2012-election-results.html|title=2012 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In the 2012 provincial election, held on April 23, 2012, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government and party leader Alison Redford retained as premier with 43.9% of the vote and 61 of 87 seats (The Legislative Assembly had added 4 seats, increasing the total to 87), the Wildrose Party led by Danielle Smith was elected as the Official Opposition with 34.3% of the vote and 17 members (replacing the Liberal Party), five Liberals were elected with 9.9% of the vote and four NDP members were elected with 9.8% of the vote.<ref>[http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm Provincial General Election April 23, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426181333/http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm |date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe May 5, 2015 [[2015 Alberta general election|election]] saw the Alberta New Democrats elected to government, making leader [[Rachel Notley]] Alberta's second female premier and its first leftist premier since 1935.\n\nAfter a single term the NDP was defeated by the United Conservative Party, who won the general election on April 16, 2019.

The [[National Energy Program]] sparked a great deal of bitterness against the federal government in [[Alberta]]; as well, the federal government involved itself in disputes over [[Petroleum|oil]] with [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dyck|2012|pp=416\u2013420}}</ref>\nWith the passage of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' through the addition of section 92A to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', the provinces were given more power with respect to their natural resources.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1992 the federal government favoured [[devolution]] of powers to the provinces, culminating in the failed [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown]] accords.

The government of the province of Alberta is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[unicameral]] legislature\u2014the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], which consists of 87 members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly].</ref>  The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and usually draws the members of Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The legislative powers in the province however, lie with the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]]. Its government resembles that of the other Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. The capital of the province is [[Edmonton]], where the [[Alberta Legislative Building]] is located. Government is conducted after the [[Westminster System|Westminster model]]. \n\n==Government of Alberta==\n{{Main|Politics of Alberta|Monarchy in Alberta}}\n\n[[File:JasperRoadEdmt.jpg|thumb|alt=Image looking west down Jasper Avenue showing the major financial centre in Edmonton|[[Jasper Avenue]], a hub of major offices and the financial centres in Edmonton.]]\n\nThe executive powers in the province lie with the Premier of Alberta and the Cabinet of Alberta or the Executive Council of Alberta. The legislative powers in the province lie with the [[Legislature of Alberta|Legislature]], which consists of two components: the [[Monarchy in Canada|Queen]], represented by the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], and the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nThe Executive Council of Alberta is officially headed by the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Alberta|Lieutenant-Governor]], as representative of the [[Monarchy in Alberta|Queen in Right of Alberta]] and is referred to as the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]]. Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a [[figurehead]] whose actions are restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The government is therefore headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The current premier is [[Jason Kenney]], who was sworn in as the 18th premier on April 30, 2019.\n\n==Legislative powers==\nThe Legislative Assembly meets in the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] in the provincial capital, [[Edmonton]].\n\nThe Legislative Assembly consists of 87 members, elected [[first past the post]] from single-member [[electoral district]]s.<ref>[https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home Elected Members of the Assembly]</ref> The [[30th Alberta Legislature|current Legislature]] is the 30th, since the [[Alberta Act, 1905|creation of the province]] in 1905.\n\nThe last election was held on [[2019 Alberta general election|April 16, 2019]], and returned a majority parliament controlled by the [[United Conservative Party]] commonly abbreviated to 'UCP'.\n\n==Executive powers==\n\n===Executive Council of Alberta===\nTypically, although not necessarily consisting of members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, the Cabinet of Alberta is similar in structure and role to the [[Cabinet of Canada]]. As federal and provincial responsibilities differ there are a number of different portfolios between the federal and provincial governments.\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, as representative of the Queen in Right of Alberta, heads the council, and is referred to as the Governor-in-Council. Other members of the Cabinet, who advise, or minister, the vice-regal, are selected by the Premier of Alberta and appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor. Most cabinet ministers are the head of a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]], but this is not always the case. In the construct of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[responsible government]], the ministerial advice tendered is typically binding, though it is important to note that, despite appearances of the contrary, the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown, not to any of the ministers,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Neitsch |first=Alfred Thomas |title=A Tradition of Vigilance: The Role of Lieutenant Governor in Alberta |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=23 |publisher=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association |location=Ottawa |year=2008 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |accessdate=May 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714043622/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/30/4/30n4_07e_Neitsch.pdf |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAs at the federal level the most important Cabinet post after that of the leader is Minister of Finance.

The usual one is \"Alberta X\", (e.g. [[Alberta Education]]) the older style is \"Ministry of X\" (e.g. [[Ministry of Finance]]). The newer style without the word \"ministry\" resembles the federal government's [[Federal Identity Program]] and the federal naming scheme, except in reverse order. Federal ministries and departments are usually \"X Canada\" (e.g. [[Environment Canada]]).\n\nWith every new cabinet ministries can be created or disbanded, renamed or gain or lose responsibilities. Some ministries such as finance or health are common to all provincial governments and are comparable to similar ministries or departments at the federal level or indeed even in other countries. However, some ministries are quite distinct to Alberta, such as the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development which oversees the management of public lands.\n\nThese are the current ministries {{As of|2015|lc=on}}, listed alphabetically, with a short description and any notes to changes to that ministry's mandate.\n\n{|table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" colspan\"300\"|Ministry\n!bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Notes\n|-\n|Indigenous Relations\n|Created 2008.

It is also the only province in Canada where there is no provincial sales tax.<ref>[http://www.taxtips.ca/provincial_sales_tax.htm Taxation] \u2013 provincial sales tax</ref>  Alberta is one of few provinces that consistently has not received [[equalization payments]] from the federal government since 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thoughtundermined.com/2012/05/12/a-short-history-of-equalization-part-1-1930-2006|title=A Short History of Equalization, part 1: 1930\u20132006|publisher=thoughtundermined.com |date=May 12, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}\n</ref> (the others being [[British Columbia]] and (until 2008) [[Ontario]], [[Equalization payments#History|the original benchmark provinces]]).

The budget also contained a $700 million risk adjustment, which was intended to reflect \"volatility of Alberta\u2019s resource revenue.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2016/fiscal-plan-overview.pdf|title=Alberta Fiscal Plan Overview (2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxation ===\nThe provincial government's revenue, although often described as predominantly coming from the province's resource base, actually is derived from a variety of sources. Non-renewable resource revenue provided the government with 24 percent of its revenue in 2010\u201311 with about the same coming from individual income tax, 14 per cent from grants from the [[Politics of Canada|federal government]], and about eight percent coming from both corporations and the government's own business activities. (source: the Government of Alberta website) Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (''see also [[Sales taxes in Canada]]'').\n\nGovernment revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name=\"Budget 2009, Building On Our Strength\">{{cite web|url=http://alberta.ca/budget2008/#|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503001735/http://alberta.ca/budget2008/|archivedate=May 3, 2008|title=Budget 2009, Building on Our Strength|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=August 9, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial sales tax (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%).

Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] (and its predecessors, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party and the United Farmers of Alberta). A fourth party, the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]], which began as a radical monetary reform movement and government but after 1944 governed in a right-wing Christian fundamentalist style, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell into powerlessness and disfavour after Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Progressive Conservatives were in government until 2015, when the NDP was elected with a large majority of the seats.\n\nOnly five parties have governed Alberta in the 110 years of its existence as a province: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015, and the NDP from 2015 on.\n\nAlberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. There are several currently active groups promoting the independence of Alberta.\n\nIn the [[2008 Alberta general election|2008 provincial election]], held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the [[Alberta Liberal Party]] was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] members were elected.<ref name=\"2008 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308170551/http://www.ctv.ca/mini/albertaElection2008/|archivedate=March 8, 2008|title=2008 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nApril 23, 2012 [[2012 Alberta general election|election]] returned the Progressive Conservative Party to government, making leader [[Alison Redford]] Alberta's first female premier.<ref name=\"2012 Alberta Election Results\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/albertavotes2012/story/2012/04/23/albertavotes2012-election-results.html|title=2012 Alberta Election Results|publisher=CTV|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> In the 2012 provincial election, held on April 23, 2012, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government and party leader Alison Redford retained as premier with 43.9% of the vote and 61 of 87 seats (The Legislative Assembly had added 4 seats, increasing the total to 87), the Wildrose Party led by Danielle Smith was elected as the Official Opposition with 34.3% of the vote and 17 members (replacing the Liberal Party), five Liberals were elected with 9.9% of the vote and four NDP members were elected with 9.8% of the vote.<ref>[http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm Provincial General Election April 23, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426181333/http://results.elections.ab.ca/wtResultsPGE.htm |date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMay 5, 2015 [[2015 Alberta general election|election]] saw the Alberta New Democrats elected to government, making leader [[Rachel Notley]] Alberta's second female premier and its first leftist premier since 1935.\n\nAfter a single term the NDP was defeated by the [[United Conservative Party]], who won the [[2019 Alberta general election|general election]] on April 16, 2019.

The [[National Energy Program]] sparked a great deal of bitterness against the federal government in [[Alberta]]; as well, the federal government involved itself in disputes over [[Petroleum|oil]] with [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dyck|2012|pp=416\u2013420}}</ref>\nWith the passage of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' through the addition of section 92A to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', the provinces were given more power with respect to their natural resources.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1992 the federal government favoured [[devolution]] of powers to the provinces, culminating in the failed [[Meech Lake Accord|Meech Lake]] and [[Charlottetown Accord|Charlottetown]] accords.
