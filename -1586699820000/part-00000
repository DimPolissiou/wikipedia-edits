by the virus and 1544 of the 2000 people they reached out to did undergo the random testing, from the entire study conducted the rate of infected people was recalculated and the death rate was recalculated and the estimation came to around 0.33% , which came really close to the study conducted by Dr. Streek in Germany where 509 candidates were tested and the conclusion also recalculated the
