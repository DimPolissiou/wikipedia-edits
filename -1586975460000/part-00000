During the [[War of the Regulation]], he traveled to the [[province of North Carolina]] to help put down the uprising. While working for the customs service, he pursued his duties with a zeal that made him very unpopular. The fact that he was a loyalist during the Tea Act, the three-pence tea tax detested by the patriots did not help his reputation. In November 1773, sailors in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], tarred and feathered him.

On January 25, 1774, according to the account in the ''[[Massachusetts Gazette]]'', Hewes saw Malcolm threatening to strike a boy with his cane. When Hewes intervened to stop Malcolm, the two men began arguing, with Malcolm insisting that Hewes should not interfere in the business of a [[gentleman]].

Some Patriot leaders, believing that mob violence hurt their cause, tried to dissuade the crowd, arguing that Malcolm should be turned over to the justice system. Hewes, who had recovered, also protested against the attack on Malcolm. The crowd refused to relent, however, citing (among other arguments) the fact that Ebenezer Richardson, a customs official who had killed an 11 year old Bostonian named [[Christopher Seider]], had escaped punishment by receiving a royal pardon.<ref>Young, ''Shoemaker'', 49.</ref> Malcolm was stripped to the waist and covered with tar and feathers.
