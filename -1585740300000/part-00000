The firing killed 9 adults and 2 unknown children.\n \nThe CPI(ML) have put up busts of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and [[Charu Majumdar|Charu Majumder]] on that piece of land. The spot has Bengai Jote Primary School next to it. There is a memorial column erected that has the names of the people who died during the police firing. The names are 1. Dhaneswari Devi (F), 2. Simaswari Mullick (F), 3. Nayaneswari Mullick (F), 4. Surubala Burman (F), 5. Sonamati Singh (F), 6. Fulmati Devi (F), 7. Samsari Saibani (F), 8. Gaudrau Saibani (M), 9.

The firing killed 9 adults and 2 unknown children.\n \nThe CPI(ML) have put up busts of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and [[Charu Majumdar|Charu Majumder]] on that piece of land. The spot has Bengai Jote Primary School next to it. There is a memorial column erected that has the names of the people who died during the police firing. The names are 1. Dhaneswari Devi (F), 2. Simaswari Mullick (F), 3. Nayaneswari Mullick (F), 4. Surubala Burman (F), 5. Sonamati Singh (F), 6. Fulmati Devi (F), 7. Samsari Saibani (F), 8. Gaudrau Saibani (M), 9.

Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the ''devotio moderna''. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps, it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the Life, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163</ref> In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\"inward silence\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\").<ref>''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''.

Dent, 1916. pp 89, 94 and 110</ref> His works, of which the most important were ''De vera contemplatione'' (\"On true contemplation\") and ''De septem gradibus amoris'' (\"On the seven steps of love\"), were published in 1848 at [[Hanover]]; also ''Reflections from the Mirror of a Mystic'' (1906) and ''Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit'' (1901).\n[[Image:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jan van Ruysbroeck]]\n==Veneration==\nAfter John's death in 1381, his [[relic]]s were carefully preserved and his memory honoured as that of a [[saint]]. After his death, stories called him the ''Ecstatic Doctor'' or ''Divine Doctor'', and his views formed a link between the [[Friends of God]] and the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation.\n\nWhen Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule's, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the [[French Revolution]]. John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by [[Pope]] [[Pius X]].\n\nNo authentic [[portrait]] of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren\u2014rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.\n\nThere is a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laeken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe epigraph of the 1884 novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time...though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages#Doctors in theology|List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages: Doctors in theology]]\n* [[Evelyn Underhill#Ruysbroeck (1914)|Evelyn Underhill's ''Ruysbroeck'']]\n* [[Hendrik Mande]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Modern editions===\n*''Jan van Ruusbroec: Opera Omnia'', ed.

Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the ''devotio moderna''. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps, it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the Life, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163</ref> In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\"inward silence\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\").<ref>''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''.

Dent, 1916. pp 89, 94 and 110</ref> His works, of which the most important were ''De vera contemplatione'' (\"On true contemplation\") and ''De septem gradibus amoris'' (\"On the seven steps of love\"), were published in 1848 at [[Hanover]]; also ''Reflections from the Mirror of a Mystic'' (1906) and ''Die Zierde der geistlichen Hochzeit'' (1901).\n[[Image:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jan van Ruysbroeck]]\n==Veneration==\nAfter John's death in 1381, his [[relic]]s were carefully preserved and his memory honoured as that of a [[saint]]. After his death, stories called him the ''Ecstatic Doctor'' or ''Divine Doctor'', and his views formed a link between the [[Friends of God]] and the [[Brethren of the Common Life]], the ideas which may have helped to bring about the Reformation.\n\nWhen Groenendaal Priory was suppressed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1783, his relics were transferred to St. Gudule's, Brussels, where, however, they were lost during the [[French Revolution]]. John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by [[Pope]] [[Pius X]].\n\nNo authentic [[portrait]] of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren\u2014rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.\n\nThere is a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laeken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe epigraph of the 1884 novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time...though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages#Doctors in theology|List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages: Doctors in theology]]\n* [[Evelyn Underhill#Ruysbroeck (1914)|Evelyn Underhill's ''Ruysbroeck'']]\n* [[Hendrik Mande]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Modern editions===\n*''Jan van Ruusbroec: Opera Omnia'', ed.

Sivachandra Chakravarty and Monomohini Devi were his father and mother respectively. As a young medical student in Calcutta, Anukulchandra started serving and treating the slum dwellers in 1911. After six years of study, he came back to Himaitpur and began to practice medicine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dpublication.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iachss-121-231.pdf|title=Diamond Scientific Publication|website=dpublication.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Anukulchandra was spiritually initiated by his mother. After his initiation, he along with his friends and companions started doing intense [[kirtan]]. During kirtan, he often went into a state of trance, fell on the ground unconsciously and uttered messages in that condition. His going into trance during kirtan, delivering holy messages during trance and the devotion of those around him started attracting many more people. As a number of people came to his village to visit him began to settle permanently, gradually his village home was converted into an ashram.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThakur Anukulchandra's service to the people as a doctor, his speaking in tongues in a state of trance as well as his advice and guidance to his followers helped him secure a position as a religious leader. The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment and put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's philosophy is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature. According to him, science and [[Dharma]] are not opposed to each other. He says, the stay of all existence is dharma.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety. According to him-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldhistoricity.lbp.world/Administrator/UploadedArticle/382.pdf|title=Ideas of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra on Individual and Society|website=Historicity research journal}}</ref>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\u201cThe source of all 'isms' is existentialism \u2013 no existence, no 'ism'.\"</poem>}}''\n\nThakur Anukulchandra has put forward his views and solutions on almost every aspect of life, be it individual, conjugal, family, social and universal. Most of his messages were dictations revealed primarily in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[English Language|English]] in the form of passages, simple rhymes and poetry and extensive discourses with his disciples and visitors. His messages cover the topics of dharma, religion, spiritualism, ideal, love, service and activity, society, education, philosophy, science, psychology, health and hygine, economics, industry, commerce, politics, law and administration, varnashram, culture and tradition, eugenics, genetics, heredity, marriage, woman, conjugal life, Universal laws and others.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/282247|title=Educational philosophy of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra and its relevance to modern Indian education, PhD Thesis|website=Shodhganga: A reservoir of Indian theses}}</ref>\n\nHis discourses with people were primarily compilations of him answering to the questions of individuals and groups during his meetings on a daily basis. Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices. Satsang at present is one of the fastest growing spiritual lineage in the world with more than 80 million members across the globe. It accepts members from all walks of life without discrimination and distinction. The members of Satsang are called '''Satsangees'''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn one of his verses, Thakur Anukulchandra puts forward the motto and ideals of Satsang in its entirety as below:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7rp2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=satsang+wants+man&source=bl&ots=w3GcUsJhLo&sig=ACfU3U0cldrr7PfnX-5nQTpyWSEKBGqy0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkePBw4XoAhXaBogKHbtPA84Q6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=satsang%20wants%20man&f=false|title=Bliss|website=books.google.co.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://satsangamerica.org/sites/default/files/books/Souvenir-US_2011.pdf|title=Souvenir-US_2011|website=satsangamerica.org}}</ref> \n''{{quote|<poem>Satsang wants man\n      in the name of the One Supreme Creator\n                                      of all beings,\n                  God, Khoda or Existence,\n                        Whatever you call Him.\n      Satsang does not think in terms of\n            Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist ;\n                  regarding each and everyone\n                        as a child of Him alone,\n                              Satsang wants to make all\n                                   submissive to that One.\n\nSatsang does not think in terms of\n      Pakistan, Hindustan, Russia, China, Europe or America either-\n            Satsang wants man, every individual of mankind\u2014\n                  whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Buddhist or whatever\u2014\n                        to be gathered in His Name\n                              at the clarion call of Panchabarhi*\nin pursuit, nurture and fulfilment,\n      in elevating offering,\n            in mutual compassionate co-operation\n                  and in an uplifting, efficient and industrious go of life\n                        so that everybody by proper work\n                              earning their food and clothing can survive,\n      maintaining distinctiveness of being\n            and moving in the way of becoming,\n                  so that everyone can understand\n                        that everyone belongs to him,\n            so that no one can think\n                  that he is helpless, penniless, shelter less,\n                        so that every single person can say courageously\n                              with active co-operative zeal of love\n      \"I am everyone's\n            and everyone is mine\".\n\nSatsang wants the greatest co-operation\n      between states\n            so that there is not the least flaw\n                  in anyone's existential becoming\n                        and so that each and everyone\n                              can move on freely\n                                    in this world\n                                          in one accord\nwith self-elevating, efficient and active,\n      progressive go of service,\n            growing in integration\n                  that is mutually fulfilling\u2014\n                        being illuminated with the inspiration\n                              that cultivates the good,\n            with an eye to fulfilling that Ideal man\n                  being meaningful in that unparalleled One.\n                                                              -Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchnadra (Dhriti Bidhayana, Vol-I, p394)</poem>}}''\n\n==Branches and centers==\nThe headquarters of Satsang, known as [[Satsang Ashram]] is located in the city of [[Deoghar]], [[Jharkhand]], India.

The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment and put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's philosophy is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature. According to him, science and [[Dharma]] are not opposed to each other. He says, the stay of all existence is dharma.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety. According to him-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldhistoricity.lbp.world/Administrator/UploadedArticle/382.pdf|title=Ideas of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra on Individual and Society|website=Historicity research journal}}</ref>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\u201cThe source of all 'isms' is existentialism \u2013 no existence, no 'ism'.\"</poem>}}''\n\nThakur Anukulchandra has put forward his views and solutions on almost every aspect of life, be it individual, conjugal, family, social and universal. Most of his messages were dictations revealed primarily in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[English Language|English]] in the form of passages, simple rhymes and poetry and extensive discourses with his disciples and visitors. His messages cover the topics of dharma, religion, spiritualism, ideal, love, service and activity, society, education, philosophy, science, psychology, health and hygine, economics, industry, commerce, politics, law and administration, varnashram, culture and tradition, eugenics, genetics, heredity, marriage, woman, conjugal life, Universal laws and others.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/282247|title=Educational philosophy of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra and its relevance to modern Indian education, PhD Thesis|website=Shodhganga: A reservoir of Indian theses}}</ref>\n\nHis discourses with people were primarily compilations of him answering to the questions of individuals and groups during his meetings on a daily basis. Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices. Satsang at present is one of the fastest growing spiritual lineage in the world with more than 80 million members across the globe. It accepts members from all walks of life without discrimination and distinction. The members of Satsang are called '''Satsangees'''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto3\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn one of his verses, Thakur Anukulchandra puts forward the motto and ideals of Satsang in its entirety as below:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7rp2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=satsang+wants+man&source=bl&ots=w3GcUsJhLo&sig=ACfU3U0cldrr7PfnX-5nQTpyWSEKBGqy0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkePBw4XoAhXaBogKHbtPA84Q6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=satsang%20wants%20man&f=false|title=Bliss|website=books.google.co.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://satsangamerica.org/sites/default/files/books/Souvenir-US_2011.pdf|title=Souvenir-US_2011|website=satsangamerica.org}}</ref> \n''{{quote|<poem>Satsang wants man\n      in the name of the One Supreme Creator\n                                      of all beings,\n                  God, Khoda or Existence,\n                        Whatever you call Him.\n      Satsang does not think in terms of\n            Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist ;\n                  regarding each and everyone\n                        as a child of Him alone,\n                              Satsang wants to make all\n                                   submissive to that One.\n\nSatsang does not think in terms of\n      Pakistan, Hindustan, Russia, China, Europe or America either-\n            Satsang wants man, every individual of mankind\u2014\n                  whether Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Buddhist or whatever\u2014\n                        to be gathered in His Name\n                              at the clarion call of Panchabarhi*\nin pursuit, nurture and fulfilment,\n      in elevating offering,\n            in mutual compassionate co-operation\n                  and in an uplifting, efficient and industrious go of life\n                        so that everybody by proper work\n                              earning their food and clothing can survive,\n      maintaining distinctiveness of being\n            and moving in the way of becoming,\n                  so that everyone can understand\n                        that everyone belongs to him,\n            so that no one can think\n                  that he is helpless, penniless, shelter less,\n                        so that every single person can say courageously\n                              with active co-operative zeal of love\n      \"I am everyone's\n            and everyone is mine\".\n\nSatsang wants the greatest co-operation\n      between states\n            so that there is not the least flaw\n                  in anyone's existential becoming\n                        and so that each and everyone\n                              can move on freely\n                                    in this world\n                                          in one accord\nwith self-elevating, efficient and active,\n      progressive go of service,\n            growing in integration\n                  that is mutually fulfilling\u2014\n                        being illuminated with the inspiration\n                              that cultivates the good,\n            with an eye to fulfilling that Ideal man\n                  being meaningful in that unparalleled One.\n                                                              -Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchnadra (Dhriti Bidhayana, Vol-I, p394)</poem>}}''\n\n==Branches and centers==\nThe headquarters of Satsang, known as [[Satsang Ashram]] is located in the city of [[Deoghar]], [[Jharkhand]], India.

In a recipe adapted for the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]], [[walnuts]] were recommended.<ref name=serventi235/>\n\nThe traditional lasagne of Naples, ''lasagne di carnevale'', are layered with local [[sausage]], small fried [[meatballs]], [[hard-boiled eggs]], [[ricotta]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses, and sauced with a [[Neapolitan rag\u00f9]], a meat sauce.<ref name=\"delconte\">{{cite book |last=Del Conte |first=Anna |title=Gastronomy of Italy |date=December 1, 2013 |isbn=978-1862059580 |publisher=Pavilion }}</ref> ''Lasagne al forno'', layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, [[tomato sauce]], meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with [[wine]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[oregano]]. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked ([[al forno]]).\n\nTraditionally, pasta dough prepared in [[Southern Italy]] used [[semolina]] and water; in the [[Northern Italy|northern regions]], where semolina was not available, [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is [[durum wheat]], commercial lasagne are made of semolina from durum wheat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree 187 |url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf |publisher=translation from UA A.F.P.A |accessdate=7 October 2012 |date=9 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and especially in its capital, [[Bologna]], layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables in the dough) and served with [[rag\u00f9 alla bolognese|rag\u00f9]] (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Regional Italian cuisine: typical recipes and culinary impressions from all regions|last=Hess|first=Reinhardt|last2=S\u00e4lzer|first2=Sabine|publisher=Barron's|year=1999|isbn=9780764151590|location=|pages=|oclc=42786762}}</ref><ref>Root, Waverley.

In a recipe adapted for the [[Lent]]en [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fast]], [[walnuts]] were recommended.<ref name=serventi235/>\n\nThe traditional lasagne of Naples, ''lasagne di carnevale'', are layered with local [[sausage]], small fried [[meatballs]], [[hard-boiled eggs]], [[ricotta]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses, and sauced with a [[Neapolitan rag\u00f9]], a meat sauce.<ref name=\"delconte\">{{cite book |last=Del Conte |first=Anna |title=Gastronomy of Italy |date=December 1, 2013 |isbn=978-1862059580 |publisher=Pavilion }}</ref> ''Lasagne al forno'', layered with a thicker rag\u00f9 and [[B\u00e9chamel sauce]], and corresponding to the most common version of the dish outside Italy, are traditionally associated with the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of Italy. In other regions, lasagne can be made with various combinations of ricotta or mozzarella cheese, [[tomato sauce]], meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), and vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, olives, mushrooms), and the dish is typically flavoured with [[wine]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], and [[oregano]]. In all cases, the lasagne are oven-baked ([[al forno]]).\n\nTraditionally, pasta dough prepared in [[Southern Italy]] used [[semolina]] and water; in the [[Northern Italy|northern regions]], where semolina was not available, [[flour]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] were used. In modern Italy, since the only type of wheat allowed for commercially sold pasta is [[durum wheat]], commercial lasagne are made of semolina from durum wheat.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Decree 187 |url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf |publisher=translation from UA A.F.P.A |accessdate=7 October 2012 |date=9 February 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, and especially in its capital, [[Bologna]], layers of lasagne are traditionally green (the color is obtained by mixing spinach or other vegetables in the dough) and served with [[rag\u00f9 alla bolognese|rag\u00f9]] (a thick sauce made from onions, carrots, celery, finely ground pork and beef, butter, and tomatoes),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Regional Italian cuisine: typical recipes and culinary impressions from all regions|last=Hess|first=Reinhardt|last2=S\u00e4lzer|first2=Sabine|publisher=Barron's|year=1999|isbn=9780764151590|location=|pages=|oclc=42786762}}</ref><ref>Root, Waverley.
