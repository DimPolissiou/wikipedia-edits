Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| link1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)'''\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| link2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| caption2 = '''Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)'''\n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| link3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| caption3 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)'''\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal.

Incidentally, \n\n=== Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. ===\nBoth Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to  Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations.

Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta.

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar [[Viramadeva|Viramdeo]] were killed in a battle against [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Alauddin Khalji]] in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939). Oswal Jati ka Itihas. Oswal History Publishing House, Bhanpura, Indore.</ref>\n\nAround middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara. He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh (Hindi) \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg\n| alt1 = Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya.[[File:Raja Shri Karan in battle at Chittor by Lalit C Sharma.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Raja Bohitya sacrificed his life in the battle at Chittorgarh, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I, against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n<br/>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983). Bachhawat Gotriya Mehta Vansh: Utpati, Ateet and Vartmaan (Hindi).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

On his way back to Spain he first reached Lisbon, in Portugal. There he asked for another meeting with [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] to show him the newly discovered lands.\n\nAfter learning of the Castilian-sponsored voyage, the Portuguese King sent a threatening letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] stating that by the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]] signed in 1479 and confirmed in 1481 with the [[papal bull]] ''[[\u00c6terni regis]]'', that granted all lands south of the [[Canary Islands]] to Portugal, all of the lands discovered by Columbus belonged, in fact, to Portugal. Also, the Portuguese King stated that he was already making arrangements for a fleet (an armada led by [[Francisco de Almeida]]) to depart shortly and take possession of the new lands.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} After reading the letter the Catholic Monarchs knew they did not have any military power in the Atlantic to match the Portuguese, so they pursued a diplomatic way out.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} On {{nowrap|4 May}} 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] ([[Rodrigo Borgia]]), an [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] from [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] by birth, decreed in the bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' that all lands west of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west of any of the islands of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile, although territory under Catholic rule as of Christmas 1492 would remain untouched.<ref>{{cite wikisource |wslink=Inter Caetera |title=Inter Caetera |author=Pope Alexander VI |date=4 May 1493}}</ref> The bull did not mention Portugal or its lands, so Portugal could not claim newly discovered lands even if they were east of the line. Another bull, ''[[Dudum siquidem]]'', entitled ''Extension of the Apostolic Grant and Donation of the Indies'' and dated {{nowrap|25 September}} 1493, gave all mainlands and islands, \"at one time or even still belonging to India\" to Spain, even if east of the line.<ref>{{cite wikisource |wslink=Dudum siquidem |title=Dudum siquidem |wslanguage=la |author=Pope Alexander VI |date=25 September 1493}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese King John II was not pleased with that arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014it prevented him from possessing India, his near term goal.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} By 1493 Portuguese explorers had reached the southern tip of Africa, the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The Portuguese were unlikely to go to war over the islands encountered by Columbus, but the explicit mention of India was a major issue. As the Pope had not made changes, the Portuguese king opened direct negotiations with the Catholic Monarchs, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], to move the line to the west and allow him to claim newly discovered lands east of the line.  In the bargain, John accepted ''[[Inter caetera]]'' as the starting point of discussion with Ferdinand and Isabella, but had the boundary line moved 270 leagues west, protecting the Portuguese route down the coast of Africa and giving the Portuguese rights to lands that now constitute the Eastern quarter of Brazil. As one scholar assessed the results, \"both sides must have known that so vague a boundary could not be accurately fixed, and each thought that the other was deceived, [concluding that it was a] diplomatic triumph  for Portugal, confirming to the Portuguese not only the true route to India, but most of the South Atlantic\".<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

Castile gained lands including most of the Americas, which in 1494 had little proven wealth. The easternmost part of current Brazil was granted to Portugal when in 1500 [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] landed there while he was en route to India.

However, the Catholic Monarchs attempted to stop the Portuguese advance in Asia, by claiming the meridian line ran around the world, dividing the whole world in half rather than just the Atlantic.  Portugal pushed back, seeking another papal pronouncement that limited the line of demarcation to the Atlantic. This was given by Pope [[Leo X]], who was friendly toward Portugal and its discoveries, in 1514 in the bull ''Praecelsae devotionis''.<ref>Parry, ''Age of Reconnaissance'' p. 202.</ref>\n\nFor a period between 1580 and 1640, the treaty was rendered meaningless, as the Spanish King was also King of Portugal. It was superseded by the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|1750 Treaty of Madrid]] which granted Portugal control of the lands it occupied in South America. However, the latter treaty was immediately repudiated by the Catholic Monarch. The [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] settled the problem, with Spain acquiring territories east of the [[Uruguay River]] and Portugal acquiring territories in the [[Amazon Basin]].\n\nEmerging Protestant maritime powers, particularly England and The Netherlands, and other third parties such as Roman Catholic France, did not recognize the division of the world between only two Roman Catholic nations brokered by the pope.<ref>Parry, ''Age of Reconnaissance'' p. 205.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Tordesillas meridian==\n[[File:Early Tordesillas lines.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Early Tordesillas lines in South America (1495\u20131545)]]\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas only specified the line of demarcation in leagues from the Cape Verde Islands. It did not specify the line in degrees, nor did it identify the specific island or the specific length of its league. Instead, the treaty stated that these matters were to be settled by a joint voyage which never occurred. The number of degrees can be determined via a ratio of marine leagues to degrees applied to the Earth regardless of its assumed size, or via a specific marine league applied to the true size of the Earth, called \"our sphere\" by historian [[Henry Harrisse]].<ref>Henry Harrisse, ''The Diplomatic History of America: Its first chapter 1452\u20141493\u20141494'' (London: Stevens, 1897). pp. 194</ref>\n* The earliest Aragonese opinion was provided by Jaime Ferrer in 1495 at the request of the Aragonese king and Castilian queen to those monarchs. He stated that the demarcation line was 18\u00b0 west of the most central island of the Cape Verde Islands, which is [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] according to Harrisse, having a longitude of 24\u00b025\u2032 west of [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]], hence Ferrer placed the line at 42\u00b025\u2032W on his sphere, which was 21.1% larger than our sphere. Ferrer also stated that his league contained 32 Olympic [[stadion (unit of length)|stades]], or {{nowrap|6.15264 km}} according to Harrisse, thus Ferrer's line was {{nowrap|2,276.5 km}} west of Fogo at 47\u00b037\u2032W on our sphere.<ref>Harrisse, pp. 91\u201397, 178\u2013190.</ref>\n[[File:CantinoPlanisphere.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Cantino planisphere]] depicting the meridian, 1502]]\n* The earliest surviving Portuguese opinion is on the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502. Because its demarcation line was midway between Cape Saint Roque (northeast cape of South America) and the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] (its estuary is marked ''Todo este mar he de agua do\u00e7e\u2014''\"All of this sea is fresh water\"\u2014and its river is marked ''Rio grande'', \"great river\"), Harrisse concluded that the line was at 42\u00b030\u2032W on our sphere. Harrisse believed the large estuary just west of the line on the Cantino map was that of the Rio Maranh\u00e3o (this estuary is now the [[Ba\u00eda de S\u00e3o Marcos]] and the river is now the [[Mearim River|Mearim]]), whose flow is so weak that its gulf does ''not'' contain fresh water.<ref>Harrisse, pp. 100\u2013102, 190\u2013192.</ref>\n* In 1518 another Castilian opinion was provided by Martin Fernandez de Enciso. Harrisse concluded that Enciso placed his line at 47\u00b024\u2032W on his sphere (7.7% smaller than ours), but at 45\u00b038\u2032W on our sphere using Enciso's numerical data. Enciso also described the coastal features near which the line passed in a very confused manner. Harrisse concluded from this description that Enciso's line could also be near the mouth of the Amazon between [[49th meridian west|49\u00b0W]] and [[50th meridian west|50\u00b0W]].<ref>Harrisse, pp. 103\u2013108, 122, 192\u2013200.</ref>\n* In 1524 the Castilian pilots (ships' captains) Thomas Duran, Sebastian Cabot (son of [[John Cabot]]), and Juan Vespuccius (nephew of [[Amerigo Vespucci]]) gave their opinion to the Badajoz Junta, whose failure to resolve the dispute led to the [[Treaty of Zaragoza|Treaty of Saragossa]]. They specified that the line was 22\u00b0 plus nearly {{nowrap|9 miles}} west of the center of [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] (the westernmost Cape Verde island), which Harrisse concluded was 47\u00b017\u2032W on their sphere (3.1% smaller than ours) and 46\u00b036\u2032W on our sphere.<ref>Harrisse, pp. 138\u2013139, 207\u2013208.</ref>\n* In 1524 the Portuguese presented a globe to the Badajoz Junta on which the line was marked 21\u00b030\u2032 west of Santo Ant\u00e3o (22\u00b06\u203236\u2033 on our sphere).<ref>Harrisse, pp. 207\u2013208.</ref>\n\n==Antimeridian: Moluccas and Treaty of Zaragoza==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Treaty of Zaragoza}}\n[[File:Blaeu - Moluccae Insulae Celeberrimae.jpg|thumb|left|Dutch map of the Moluccas (north is at right)]]\nInitially, the line of demarcation did not encircle the Earth.

In the early 16th century, the Treaty between Spain and Portugal, concluded at Vitoria; February 19, 1524 and called for the Badajoz Junta to meet in 1524, at which the two countries tried to reach an agreement on the anti-meridian but failed.<ref>Emma Helen Blair, ''[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Philippine-Islands-1493-18032.html The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131803, part 2]''</ref> They finally agreed in a treaty signed at [[Zaragoza]] that Spain would relinquish its claims to the Moluccas upon the payment of 350,000 [[ducat]]s of gold{{refn |350,000 ducats of gold weighs about 1,230&nbsp;kg at 3.521 grams of gold per ducat.

Portugal's portion was roughly 191\u00b0 whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169\u00b0. Both portions have a large uncertainty of \u00b14\u00b0 because of the wide variation in the opinions regarding the location of the Tordesillas line.\n\nPortugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the Saragossa line, including all of Asia and its neighboring islands so far \"discovered\", leaving Spain most of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Although the Philippines were not named in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to them because they were well west of the line. Nevertheless, by 1542, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] decided to colonize the Philippines, judging that Portugal would not protest because the archipelago had no spices. Although a number of expeditions sent from [[New Spain]] arrived in the Philippines, they were unable to establish a settlement because the return route across the Pacific was unknown. King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] succeeded in 1565 when he sent [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], establishing the initial Spanish trading post at [[Cebu]] and later founding [[Manila]] in 1571.\n\nBesides [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and the Moluccas, Portugal eventually controlled [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (among other territories and bases) in [[Africa]]; several bases or territories as [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Ormus]] and [[Bahrain]] in the Persian Gulf, [[Goa]], [[Bombay]] and [[Daman and Diu]] (among other coastal cities) in [[Portuguese India|India]]; [[Portuguese Ceylon|Ceylon]], and [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], bases in present-day Indonesia as [[Makassar]], [[Solor]]   and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Portuguese Timor]], the ''entrep\u00f4t''-base of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and the entrep\u00f4t-enclave of [[Dejima]] ([[Nagasaki]]) in the Far East.\n\nSpain, on the other hand, would control vast western regions in the Americas, in areas ranging from the present-day United States to present-day Argentina, an empire that would extend to the Philippines, and bases in Ternate and [[Formosa]] (17th century).\n\n{|style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Portuguese and Spanish empires (anachronous world maps)\n|-\n| [[File:The Portuguese Empire.png|180px|thumb|[[Portuguese Empire]]]]\n| [[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous en.svg|180px|thumb|[[Spanish Empire]] alongside Iberian Union]]\n| [[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|180px|thumb|[[Iberian Union]] (1581\u20131640)]]\n|}\n\n==Effect on other European powers==\nThe treaty was important in dividing Latin America, as well as establishing Spain in the western Pacific until 1898.  However, it quickly became obsolete in North America, and later in Asia and Africa, where it affected colonization.  It was ignored by other European nations, and with the decline of Spanish and Portuguese power, the home countries were unable to hold many of their claims, much less expand them into poorly explored areas.  Thus, with sufficient backing, it became possible for any European state to colonize open territories, or those weakly held by Lisbon or Madrid.  With the fall of [[Malacca]] to the Dutch, the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]]) took control of Portuguese possessions in Indonesia, claiming Western New Guinea and Western Australia, as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Eastern Australia remained in the Spanish half of the world until claimed for Britain by [[James Cook]] in 1770. The attitude towards the treaty that other governments had was expressed in a statement attributed to France's King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], \"Show me Adam's will!\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGXeFCkTmlgC&pg=PA20 |title=''Skyscrapers hide the heavens: a history of Indian-white relations in Canada''| page=20 |publisher=|date= 2000-06-01|accessdate=2010-06-07|isbn=9780802081537|author1=Miller|first1=James Rodger}}</ref>\n\n==Treaty of Madrid==\n{{Main|Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)}}\n\nIn January 13, 1750, [[King John V of Portugal]] and [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] signed the Treaty of Madrid, in which both parties sought to establish the borders between Brazil and Spanish America, admitting that the Treaty of Tordesillas, as it had been envisioned in 1494 had been superseded, and was considered void.

On his way back to Spain he first reached Lisbon, in Portugal. There he asked for another meeting with [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] to show him the newly discovered lands.\n\nAfter learning of the Castilian-sponsored voyage, the Portuguese King sent a threatening letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] stating that by the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]] signed in 1479 and confirmed in 1481 with the [[papal bull]] ''[[\u00c6terni regis]]'', that granted all lands south of the [[Canary Islands]] to Portugal, all of the lands discovered by Columbus belonged, in fact, to Portugal. Also, the Portuguese King stated that he was already making arrangements for a fleet (an armada led by [[Francisco de Almeida]]) to depart shortly and take possession of the new lands.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} After reading the letter the Catholic Monarchs knew they did not have any military power in the Atlantic to match the Portuguese, so they pursued a diplomatic way out.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} On {{nowrap|4 May}} 1493 [[Pope Alexander VI]] ([[Rodrigo Borgia]]), an [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] from [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] by birth, decreed in the bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'' that all lands west of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west of any of the islands of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile, although territory under Catholic rule as of Christmas 1492 would remain untouched.<ref>{{cite wikisource |wslink=Inter Caetera |title=Inter Caetera |author=Pope Alexander VI |date=4 May 1493}}</ref> The bull did not mention Portugal or its lands, so Portugal could not claim newly discovered lands even if they were east of the line. Another bull, ''[[Dudum siquidem]]'', entitled ''Extension of the Apostolic Grant and Donation of the Indies'' and dated {{nowrap|25 September}} 1493, gave all mainlands and islands, \"at one time or even still belonging to India\" to Spain, even if east of the line.<ref>{{cite wikisource |wslink=Dudum siquidem |title=Dudum siquidem |wslanguage=la |author=Pope Alexander VI |date=25 September 1493}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese King John II was not pleased with that arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land\u2014it prevented him from possessing India, his near term goal.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} By 1493 Portuguese explorers had reached the southern tip of Africa, the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The Portuguese were unlikely to go to war over the islands encountered by Columbus, but the explicit mention of India was a major issue. As the Pope had not made changes, the Portuguese king opened direct negotiations with the Catholic Monarchs, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]], to move the line to the west and allow him to claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

It did not specify the line in degrees, nor did it identify the specific island or the specific length of its league. Instead, the treaty stated that these matters were to be settled by a joint voyage which never occurred. The number of degrees can be determined via a ratio of marine leagues to degrees applied to the Earth regardless of its assumed size, or via a specific marine league applied to the true size of the Earth, called \"our sphere\" by historian [[Henry Harrisse]].<ref>Henry Harrisse, ''The Diplomatic History of America: Its first chapter 1452\u20141493\u20141494'' (London: Stevens, 1897). pp. 194</ref>\n* The earliest Aragonese opinion was provided by Jaime Ferrer in 1495 at the request of the Aragonese king and Castilian queen to those monarchs. He stated that the demarcation line was 18\u00b0 west of the most central island of the Cape Verde Islands, which is [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]] according to Harrisse, having a longitude of 24\u00b025\u2032 west of [[Greenwich meridian|Greenwich]], hence Ferrer placed the line at 42\u00b025\u2032W on his sphere, which was 21.1% larger than our sphere. Ferrer also stated that his league contained 32 Olympic [[stadion (unit of length)|stades]], or {{nowrap|6.15264 km}} according to Harrisse, thus Ferrer's line was {{nowrap|2,276.5 km}} west of Fogo at 47\u00b037\u2032W on our sphere.<ref>Harrisse, pp. 91\u201397, 178\u2013190.</ref>\n[[File:CantinoPlanisphere.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Cantino planisphere]] depicting the meridian, 1502]]\n* The earliest surviving Portuguese opinion is on the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502.

Harrisse believed the large estuary just west of the line on the Cantino map was that of the Rio Maranh\u00e3o (this estuary is now the [[Ba\u00eda de S\u00e3o Marcos]] and the river is now the [[Mearim River|Mearim]]), whose flow is so weak that its gulf does ''not'' contain fresh water.<ref>Harrisse, pp. 100\u2013102, 190\u2013192.</ref>\n* In 1518 another Castilian opinion was provided by Martin Fernandez de Enciso.

Enciso also described the coastal features near which the line passed in a very confused manner.

Portugal's portion was roughly 191\u00b0 whereas Spain's portion was roughly 169\u00b0. Both portions have a large uncertainty of \u00b14\u00b0 because of the wide variation in the opinions regarding the location of the Tordesillas line.\n\nPortugal gained control of all lands and seas west of the Saragossa line, including all of Asia and its neighboring islands so far \"discovered\", leaving Spain most of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Although the Philippines were not named in the treaty, Spain implicitly relinquished any claim to them because they were well west of the line. Nevertheless, by 1542, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] decided to colonize the Philippines, judging that Portugal would not protest because the archipelago had no spices. Although a number of expeditions sent from [[New Spain]] arrived in the Philippines, they were unable to establish a settlement because the return route across the Pacific was unknown. King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] succeeded in 1565 when he sent [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] and [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], establishing the initial Spanish trading post at [[Cebu]] and later founding [[Manila]] in 1571.\n\nBesides [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and the Moluccas, Portugal eventually controlled [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], and [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] (among other territories and bases) in [[Africa]]; several bases or territories as [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Ormus]] and [[Bahrain]] in the Persian Gulf, [[Goa]], [[Bombay]] and [[Daman and Diu]] (among other coastal cities) in [[Portuguese India|India]]; [[Portuguese Ceylon|Ceylon]], and [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], bases in present-day Indonesia as [[Makassar]], [[Solor]]   and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Portuguese Timor]], the ''entrep\u00f4t''-base of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and the entrep\u00f4t-enclave of [[Dejima]] ([[Nagasaki]]) in the Far East.\n\nSpain, on the other hand, would control vast western regions in the Americas, in areas ranging from the present-day United States to present-day Argentina, an empire that would extend to the Philippines, and bases in Ternate and [[Formosa]] (17th century).\n\n{|style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Portuguese and Spanish empires (anachronous world maps)\n|-\n| [[File:The Portuguese Empire.png|180px|thumb|[[Portuguese Empire]]]]\n| [[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous en.svg|180px|thumb|[[Spanish Empire]] alongside Iberian Union]]\n| [[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|180px|thumb|[[Iberian Union]] (1581\u20131640)]]\n|}\n\n==Effect on other European powers==\nThe treaty was important in dividing Latin America, as well as establishing Spain in the western Pacific until 1898.  However, it quickly became obsolete in North America, and later in Asia and Africa, where it affected colonization.  It was ignored by other European nations, and with the decline of Spanish and Portuguese power, the home countries were unable to hold many of their claims, much less expand them into poorly explored areas.  Thus, with sufficient backing, it became possible for any European state to colonize open territories, or those weakly held by Lisbon or Madrid.  With the fall of [[Malacca]] to the Dutch, the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]]) took control of Portuguese possessions in Indonesia, claiming Western New Guinea and Western Australia, as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Eastern Australia remained in the Spanish half of the world until claimed for Britain by [[James Cook]] in 1770.

{"title_page": "Early naval vessels of New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Historic ships of the RNZN}}\nA range of [[Naval ship|naval vessels]] were used in [[New Zealand]] from its [[History of New Zealand#Early contact period|early settlement years]] to the formation of the [[New Zealand Naval Forces]] in 1913. In the mid-19th century, these vessels included [[frigate]]s, [[sloop]]s, [[schooner]]s, and steam-driven [[paddlewheel]] boats. In 1846, five years after New Zealand was first [[History of New Zealand#Colonial period|proclaimed a colony]], it bought its first gunboat. In the 1840s and 1850s, steam boats were used to survey the ports and the coastline. In the 1860s, New Zealand established the Waikato flotilla, its first ''de facto'' navy.\n\nBy the late 19th century, New Zealand was using cruisers and torpedo boats. In the 1880s, in response to the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The \"Russian-scare\" forts of 1885|Russian scares]], coastal defences were established, a mine-laying steamer was ordered, and spar torpedo boats began patrolling the main ports. In 1911, New Zealand funded the construction of a battlecruiser, and in 1913, the [[New Zealand Naval Forces]] were created as a separate division within the [[Royal Navy]].\n\n==Early settlers==\n\n===Polynesian settlers===\n[[Image:EarleWarSpeech.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Waka taua (war canoes) at the Bay of Islands, 1827-8]]\n\nThe initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 [[Common Era|CE]] when it was discovered by [[Polynesia]]ns who arrived in oceangoing canoes, or [[Waka (canoe)|waka]].<ref name=Lowe>{{cite web|url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/10289/2690/1/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf|title=Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and the impacts of volcanism on early Maori society: an update|last=Lowe|first=David J.|year=2008|publisher=University of Waikato|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> The descendants of these settlers became known as the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], forming a distinct [[M\u0101ori culture|culture]] centred on kinship links and land.<ref>Sutton, Douglas G. (Ed.) (1994). The Origins of the First New Zealanders. Auckland: Auckland University Press.</ref>\nThe earliest war boats to operate in New Zealand were the large decorated war canoes or [[Waka (canoe)#Waka taua (war canoes)|waka taua]] of the M\u0101ori. These could be over 30 metres long and were manned by up to 100 paddlers. It was a double hulled waka that rammed the ship's boat of Abel Tasman enabling Maori to board and kill 4 sailors.<ref>Diary of Abel Tasman.Reed 2008.</ref> Waka taua were used to transport warriors to and from battle especially during the Musket War period 1805 to 1843. Less often battles were fought at sea. In late 1863 many waka on the Waikato River were destroyed by New Zealand militia to prevent rebelling Maori from attacking Auckland. Settlers were annoyed that the waka had not been destroyed earlier in the war. This had allowed rebelling Kingitanga Maori from the Waikato to cross into Auckland and murder a total of 18 settlers living on the outskirts of Auckland.<ref>Diary Of W. Morgan.N.

Over 100 years later, in 1769, the British naval captain [[James Cook]] of [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] made the [[First voyage of James Cook|first]] of his three visits. From the late 18th century, the country was increasingly visited by British, French and American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]] and [[Trade|trading]] ships. In 1841 New Zealand became a [[British Empire|British colony]] followed by a period of [[New Zealand Wars|wars]]. New Zealand gradually became more [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] and achieved the relative independence of a [[British Dominions|dominion]] in 1907.\n\nIn 1788 the colony of [[New South Wales]] was founded with a commission that technically included responsibility for New Zealand. In practice this had little consequence, since the New South Wales administration was not really interested in New Zealand. From the 1790s the New Zealand coast was increasingly visited by explorers, traders and adventurers. They traded European goods, including guns and metal tools, for food, water, wood, [[New Zealand flax|flax]] and sex.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|last=King|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael King| isbn=0-14-301867-1| year=2003|pages=122}}</ref> European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, establishing trading stations and buying land from the M\u0101ori. However different concepts of land ownership led to increasing conflict and bitterness. [[Missionaries]] were also settling, attempting to [[Christianization|convert]] M\u0101ori to Christianity and control European lawlessness.\n\nIn 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to establish colonies in New Zealand. This alarmed the missionaries, who called for more British control. Captain [[William Hobson]] was sent to New Zealand to persuade M\u0101ori to cede their [[sovereignty]] to the [[British Crown]]. On 6 February 1840, Hobson and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] in the [[Bay of Islands]].\n\n==Surveying the coast==\nThe first general charting of the New Zealand coast was done with great competence by Cook on his first visit in 1769. The chart was published in 1772 and remained current for 66 years.<ref>Hooker, Brian [http://www.findingnz.co.nz/xk/kxk1_official_general_charts_1772_1885.htm ''Official General Charts of New Zealand 1772\u20131885''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102170212/http://www.findingnz.co.nz/xk/kxk1_official_general_charts_1772_1885.htm |date=2007-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1840 several Royal Navy ships were engaged in [[hydrography|hydrographic]] surveys directed by the [[Admiralty]]. Captain [[Owen Stanley]], on [[HMS Britomart|HMS ''Britomart'']], drew up an [[Admiralty chart]] of the [[Waitemat\u0101 Harbour]].<ref>Hooker, Brian [http://www.findingnz.co.nz/yg/dyg1.htm ''Early New Zealand Printed Maps''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102163451/http://www.findingnz.co.nz/yg/dyg1.htm |date=2008-01-02 }}</ref> The ''Britomart'' was a [[Cherokee class brig-sloop|''Cherokee'' class]] [[Sloop-of-war#Sloop-of-war|brig-sloop]] of the Royal Navy. In this survey, he named [[Point Britomart|Britomart Point]] after his ship. Stanley was a talented painter, but he seemed to suffer from a temporary lack of invention when he named another prominent point the Second Point. Today this is called Stanley Point.<ref>Platts, Una (1980) ''Nineteenth Century New Zealand Artists'' [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-PlaNine-t1-body-d1-d1120.html Stanley, Captain Owen 1811\u20131850]</ref>\n\nA detailed survey of the New Zealand coast was essential for economic development and in 1848 [[HMS Acheron (1838)|HMS ''Acheron'']], a steam paddle sloop, began the \"Great Survey\". [[HMS Pandora|HMS ''Pandora'']] took over and continued until 1856, when the harbours and most of the coast had been freshly surveyed. In the 1890s until 1905, [[HMS Penguin|HMS ''Penguin'']] updated the surveys.<ref>Dennerly (2002) Page 4</ref>\n\n==New Zealand Wars==\n{{main|New Zealand Wars}}\nFrom 1840 [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]], mainly from the [[United Kingdom]], increased markedly. New Zealand became a [[Colony of New Zealand|colony of Britain]] in its own right on 3 May 1841, and the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|New Zealand Constitution Act]] of 1852 established central and provincial governments.\n\nAs more European immigrants ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]) arrived, the pressure on the indigenous [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to sell land increased. M\u0101ori initially welcomed P\u0101keh\u0101 for the trading opportunities and the opportunity to learn new technologies, but by the late 1850s some Maori began to resent the loss of their autonomy. The [[Hapu]] (sub-tribes) who willingly sold their land by the late 1850s were refusing to sell and putting pressure on other Maori to do the same. Some tribes such at [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]] in the South Island sold vast areas of land. For M\u0101ori, land ([[whenua]]) was not just an economic resource but the basis of their identity and a connection with their ancestors. Land was normally in the control of the chiefs of hapu. Land sale records show that hapu and their leaders still willingly sold land to the government. P\u0101keh\u0101, especially from 1860, were keen to buy more land. This clashed with the decision of the militant [[Kingitanga]] Maori in the Waikato to refuse to sell.\n\nThis refusal to sell land and an attempt to set up an independent Kingitanga state was seen as rebellion by the government and was the primary cause of the [[New Zealand Wars]] in the 1860s, when the [[Taranaki]] and [[Waikato]] regions were  scenes of conflict between the New Zealand government supported by British troops, colonial troops, local militia and loyal (kupapa) Maori fighting against the rebelling Kingite Maori . On their defeat in 1864 the M\u0101ori rebels forfeited some of their land. 3% of New Zealand's land was taken, although large areas of this were reserved for Maori and some of the land was never surveyed or occupied and subsequently returned to Maori. Defeat of the rebels was aided by the large flotilla of vessels brought to New Zealand by [[Duncan Alexander Cameron|General Cameron]] in 1863 to operate in the Waikato River. The flotilla comprised shallow draught boats, including gunboats and barges for transporting troops and supplies, as the front line moved progressively south. Many of these vessels were sourced from Australia and captained by experienced Australian officers. Cameron also opened a second maritime link by bringing troops and supplies over the [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]] bar and building a [[redoubt]] at Raglan. Troops were marched over an old Maori trail that was widened by the Forest Rangers to allow access to the area north of [[Pirongia]].<ref>Stowers, Richard and  Binsley, John E.

There was no base in New Zealand.\n\nIn the quarter century from 1845, some twenty [[Royal Navy]] ships took part in actions between M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101, with the colonial government taking up some commercial ships in supporting roles. Another contribution came on loan from [[Australia]], in the form of the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] naval screw steam [[sloop]] [[HMS Victoria (1855)|''Victoria'']], in the first [[First Taranaki War|Taranaki conflict]] of 1860\u201361. They and the [[East Indiaman]] [[HMS Elphinstone|''Elphinstone'']] provided gun and crew, to form militia units for fighting ashore. The ships served mainly as communication, transport and supply links between places of conflict but, more importantly perhaps, also served as real symbols of [[British Empire|British]] authority in areas where conflict was close to breaking out, or already had.<ref name=McDougall161>McDougall (1989) Page 161.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=5 align=\"center\"| '''Royal Navy ships involved in the first New Zealand Wars'''<ref name=\"Dennerly 2002\">Dennerly (2002</ref> \n|-\n! width=\"90\" align=\"left\"|Name\n! width=\"90\" align=\"left\"|Type\n!

The gunboat was used for some time at Porirua on patrol duty, manned mainly by crew from the ''Calliope''. In December it was transferred to [[Wanganui]], again aboard ''Calliope''.

In June 1860, [[HMS Pelorus (1857)|HMS ''Pelorus'']], the flagship of the [[History of the Royal Australian Navy#Pre-Federation navies|Australian Squadron]] of the Royal Navy, participated in the attack on Puketakauere [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|''pa'']] during the [[First Taranaki War#The King Movement Intervenes|First Taranaki War]]. Later that year, the crew landed at Kairau to support British troops under attack from M\u0101ori and in January 1861 a gun crew from the ship helped defend the British redoubt at Huirangi against the M\u0101ori.<ref>[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~ausnavy/Military%20Action.htm Naval Military Actions]</ref>\n\nIn 1862, [[HMS Orpheus (1861)|HMS ''Orpheus'']] replaced ''Pelorus'' as flagship of the Australian Squadron. In February 1863, while delivering naval supplies and troop reinforcements to Auckland, ''Orpheus'' was [[HMS Orpheus (1861)#The wreck|wrecked]] on the sandbars at the entrance to [[Manukau Harbour]]. Of the ship's complement of 259, 189 died in the disaster.

A substantial naval dockyard with workshops was set up at Putataka (now [[Port Waikato]]) where the gunboats and barges were built and repaired. The dockyard and other depots were closed down and the flotilla dispersed after the New Zealand Wars ended in 1867.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Type\n!

A further hoax Russian warship attack, this time in Wellington in 1885, was spurred by fears over French, German and Russian policies in the South Pacific, late in 1883.\n\n===Mine-laying steamers===\nAs a contribution to port defences the government ordered a small \"submining\" steamer from Scotland. It was shipped to Wellington for assembly in sections, fitted with a locally made engine, named ''Ellen Ballance'', and went into service about 1884. She was put under the responsibility of army engineers, who gained Engineer Corp status in May 1887.\n\nSubmarine mining was the laying of defensive mines on the seabed about port entrances. In 1898 the New Zealand forces commander advised the government that ''Ellen Ballance'' was dangerous for laying out mines in anything approaching bad weather. He recommended that two \"proper\" submarine minelaying steamers should be acquired, one for Auckland and one for Wellington. This was approved, and in October 1900 the construction of two enlarged [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Napier of Magdala]] type vessels were ordered. These were named ''Janie Seddon'' and ''Lady Roberts''.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 163-164.</ref>\n\n''Ellen Ballance'' went to Lyttelton soon after being replaced by ''Janie Seddon'', and then to Otago Harbour in October 1905 as transport to RNZ Artillery gun emplacements such as [[Ripapa Island]] and [[Taiaroa Head]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These were built in 1883 by [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|John Thornycroft & Co]], London. They displaced 12 tons and measured 18.2 x 2.3 x 1 m (63 x 7.5 x 3.2 feet). They were powered from a single shaft with a steam locomotive engine generating 173&nbsp;hp (130&nbsp;kW), which give a speed of {{convert|17|kn|km/h}}. Their main weapon was an 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft) spar, projecting well forward over the bow, armed at its tip with an explosive device. A [[Nordenfelt gun]] was also fitted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Boat\n! Name\n! Port\n!

The spar boats were constructed for speed, so they were narrow and shallow, and were armoured with plating only 1.6&nbsp;mm thick. They could not operate in anything like rough water, and using them as attack vessels may well have been as hazardous for the crew as the target. They were obsolete before they were completed, and only the last two had the up-to-date Whitehead \"fish\" torpedo fitted when built.\n\nIn 1884 torpedo boat units were formed to operate them. They were organised in a similar way to the artillery \"Navals\" with appropriate naval uniforms. They were at first called the Torpedo Branch of the Armed Constabulary. Then in June 1887 they were gazetted as a permanent militia and given the formal, but more manageable title, Torpedo Corps. The torpedo boats had galvanized plating, which meant they could not stay in the water and had to be kept on slipways. Each Torpedo Corps had its own quarters and boatshed. Their main role soon became training, and by 1900 they were well out of date.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 164.</ref><ref>[http://www.navy.mil.nz/naval-reserve/naval-reserve-history/default.htm  Naval Reserve History]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.devonport.co.nz/beach.htm |title=Torpedo Bay |access-date=2008-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221065515/http://www.devonport.co.nz/beach.htm |archive-date=2007-12-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Late 1880s \u2013 early 1900s==\n\n===Calliope Dock===\n[[Image:Calliope Dock In Devonport.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Calliope (1884)|HMS ''Calliope'']] and [[HMS Diamond|HMS ''Diamond'']] in the dock during opening ceremonies 1888]]\nAn event that was to have an important bearing on New Zealand naval policy in later years was the official opening on 16 February 1888 of the Calliope [[Drydock#Graving Dock|graving dock]]. This was constructed over three years by the Auckland Harbour Board at Calliope Point on the Devonport shore.\n\nDesigned to take vessels up to {{convert|500|ft|m}}, the dock was the largest in the southern hemisphere. In 1892 the Admiralty acquired from the Harbour Board {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of reclaimed land adjacent to the dock so they could develop naval workshops.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/WH2Navy-fig-WH2Nav08a.html Opening of the Calliope Dock]</ref><ref>Bell (1962)</ref><ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/ships-famous/8 Famous ships: ''Calliope'']</ref>\n\n===Subsidies to the Royal Navy===\nFor years the Royal Navy operated an imperial squadron in Australia called the \"Australian Squadron\". The 1887 Imperial Conference in London lead to a naval agreement that the Australian Squadron would be supplemented by another squadron, a joint Australian and New Zealand naval force of five cruisers and two torpedo gunboats. These ships would be based in Sydney and called the \"Australasian Auxiliary Squadron\". Two ships, one from the Imperial squadron and one from the new squadron, would be stationed in New Zealand waters. An annual subsidy of \u00a3120,000 was to be paid to London by Australia and New Zealand, of which New Zealand's share was \u00a320,000.\n\nThis policy of subsidising Imperial navy forces allowed the Admiralty to retain central control over the navies, yet for New Zealand it guaranteed a cruiser presence in their waters. It also allowed New Zealanders direct entry into the Royal Navy. This arrangement suited both parties and remained in force for the next twenty years. The 1902 [[Imperial Conference]] modified the Naval Agreement and New Zealand's annual subsidy increased to \u00a340,000.<ref>Dennerly (2002) Page 7</ref> The subsidy was further increased in 1908 to \u00a3100,000.\n\n===A training ship===\nIn 1907 the [[Marine Department (New Zealand)|Marine Department]] acquired an 805-ton gun boat and converted her to  New Zealand's first training ship [[NZS Amokura|NZS ''Amokura'']]. Over the next 14 years, 527 boys trained in her, 25 of them going on to naval service and most of the others into the merchant marine.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 170.</ref><ref>NZ Maritime record: [http://www.nzmaritime.co.nz/amokura.htm NZS ''Amokura'' 1906\u20131955]</ref><ref>Waters (1956): Appendix IX: [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-a9.html Training ship Amokura]</ref>\n\nThe boat was originally a three masted auxiliary barquentine, square rigged on the foremast, fore-and-aft on the after masts.

On 22 March 1909 the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir [[Joseph Ward]], made an offer to fund \"one first-class battleship, and if need be, two\" as a gift to the Royal Navy. This offer was accepted by the British Government and the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS ''New Zealand'']] was built by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering|Fairfield]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,783,190.<ref>Waters (1956) Appendix VII: [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-a7.html Record of HMS ''New Zealand'']</ref>\n\nThe ''New Zealand'' was commissioned on 23 November 1912 with three New Zealand officers. After being inspected by the King, she sailed on a ten-month world cruise, arriving in [[Wellington]] in April 1913.

In the mid-19th century, these vessels included [[frigate]]s, [[sloop]]s, [[schooner]]s, and steam-driven [[paddlewheel]] boats. In 1846, five years after New Zealand was first [[History of New Zealand#Colonial period|proclaimed a colony]], it bought its first gunboat. In the 1840s and 1850s, steam boats were used to survey the ports and the coastline. In the 1860s, New Zealand established the Waikato flotilla, its first ''de facto'' navy.\n\nBy the late 19th century, New Zealand was using cruisers and torpedo boats. In the 1880s, in response to the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The \"Russian-scare\" forts of 1885|Russian scares]], coastal defences were established, a mine-laying steamer was ordered, and spar torpedo boats began patrolling the main ports. In 1911, New Zealand funded the construction of a battlecruiser, and in 1913, the [[New Zealand Naval Forces]] were created as a separate division within the [[Royal Navy]].\n\n==Early settlers==\n\n===Polynesian settlers===\n[[Image:EarleWarSpeech.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Waka taua (war canoes) at the Bay of Islands, 1827-8]]\n\nThe initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 [[Common Era|CE]] when it was discovered by [[Polynesia]]ns who arrived in oceangoing canoes, or [[Waka (canoe)|waka]].<ref name=Lowe>{{cite web|url=http://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/bitstream/10289/2690/1/Lowe%202008%20Polynesian%20settlement%20guidebook.pdf|title=Polynesian settlement of New Zealand and the impacts of volcanism on early Maori society: an update|last=Lowe|first=David J.|year=2008|publisher=University of Waikato|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> The descendants of these settlers became known as the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], forming a distinct [[M\u0101ori culture|culture]] centred on kinship links and land.<ref>Sutton, Douglas G.

Auckland: Auckland University Press.</ref>\nThe earliest war boats to operate in New Zealand were the large decorated war canoes or [[Waka (canoe)#Waka taua (war canoes)|waka taua]] of the M\u0101ori. These could be over 30 metres long and were manned by up to 100 paddlers.

Less often battles were fought at sea. In late 1863 many waka on the Waikato River were destroyed by New Zealand militia to prevent rebelling Maori from attacking Auckland. Settlers were annoyed that the waka had not been destroyed earlier in the war. This had allowed rebelling Kingitanga Maori from the Waikato to cross into Auckland and murder a total of 18 settlers living on the outskirts of Auckland.<ref>Diary Of W. Morgan.N.

Over 100 years later, in 1769, the British naval captain [[James Cook]] of [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] made the [[First voyage of James Cook|first]] of his three visits. From the late 18th century, the country was increasingly visited by British, French and American [[History of whaling|whaling]], [[Seal hunting|sealing]] and [[Trade|trading]] ships. In 1841 New Zealand became a [[British Empire|British colony]] followed by a period of [[New Zealand Wars|wars]]. New Zealand gradually became more [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] and achieved the relative independence of a [[British Dominions|dominion]] in 1907.\n\nIn 1788 the colony of [[New South Wales]] was founded with a commission that technically included responsibility for New Zealand. In practice this had little consequence, since the New South Wales administration was not really interested in New Zealand. From the 1790s the New Zealand coast was increasingly visited by explorers, traders and adventurers. They traded European goods, including guns and metal tools, for food, water, wood, [[New Zealand flax|flax]] and sex.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|last=King|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael King| isbn=0-14-301867-1| year=2003|pages=122}}</ref> European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, establishing trading stations and buying land from the M\u0101ori. However different concepts of land ownership led to increasing conflict and bitterness. [[Missionaries]] were also settling, attempting to [[Christianization|convert]] M\u0101ori to Christianity and control European lawlessness.\n\nIn 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to establish colonies in New Zealand. This alarmed the missionaries, who called for more British control. Captain [[William Hobson]] was sent to New Zealand to persuade M\u0101ori to cede their [[sovereignty]] to the [[British Crown]]. On 6 February 1840, Hobson and M\u0101ori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] in the [[Bay of Islands]].\n\n==Surveying the coast==\nThe first general charting of the New Zealand coast was done with great competence by Cook on his first visit in 1769. The chart was published in 1772 and remained current for 66 years.<ref>Hooker, Brian [http://www.findingnz.co.nz/xk/kxk1_official_general_charts_1772_1885.htm ''Official General Charts of New Zealand 1772\u20131885''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102170212/http://www.findingnz.co.nz/xk/kxk1_official_general_charts_1772_1885.htm |date=2007-11-02 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1840 several Royal Navy ships were engaged in [[hydrography|hydrographic]] surveys directed by the [[Admiralty]].

In this survey, he named [[Point Britomart|Britomart Point]] after his ship. Stanley was a talented painter, but he seemed to suffer from a temporary lack of invention when he named another prominent point the Second Point. Today this is called Stanley Point.<ref>Platts, Una (1980) ''Nineteenth Century New Zealand Artists'' [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-PlaNine-t1-body-d1-d1120.html Stanley, Captain Owen 1811\u20131850]</ref>\n\nA detailed survey of the New Zealand coast was essential for economic development and in 1848 [[HMS Acheron (1838)|HMS ''Acheron'']], a steam paddle sloop, began the \"Great Survey\". [[HMS Pandora|HMS ''Pandora'']] took over and continued until 1856, when the harbours and most of the coast had been freshly surveyed. In the 1890s until 1905, [[HMS Penguin|HMS ''Penguin'']] updated the surveys.<ref>Dennerly (2002) Page 4</ref>\n\n==New Zealand Wars==\n{{main|New Zealand Wars}}\nFrom 1840 [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]], mainly from the [[United Kingdom]], increased markedly. New Zealand became a [[Colony of New Zealand|colony of Britain]] in its own right on 3 May 1841, and the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|New Zealand Constitution Act]] of 1852 established central and provincial governments.\n\nAs more European immigrants ([[P\u0101keh\u0101]]) arrived, the pressure on the indigenous [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] to sell land increased. M\u0101ori initially welcomed P\u0101keh\u0101 for the trading opportunities and the opportunity to learn new technologies, but by the late 1850s some Maori began to resent the loss of their autonomy. The [[Hapu]] (sub-tribes) who willingly sold their land by the late 1850s were refusing to sell and putting pressure on other Maori to do the same. Some tribes such at [[Ng\u0101i Tahu]] in the South Island sold vast areas of land. For M\u0101ori, land ([[whenua]]) was not just an economic resource but the basis of their identity and a connection with their ancestors. Land was normally in the control of the chiefs of hapu. Land sale records show that hapu and their leaders still willingly sold land to the government. P\u0101keh\u0101, especially from 1860, were keen to buy more land. This clashed with the decision of the militant [[Kingitanga]] Maori in the Waikato to refuse to sell.\n\nThis refusal to sell land and an attempt to set up an independent Kingitanga state was seen as rebellion by the government and was the primary cause of the [[New Zealand Wars]] in the 1860s, when the [[Taranaki]] and [[Waikato]] regions were  scenes of conflict between the New Zealand government supported by British troops, colonial troops, local militia and loyal (kupapa) Maori fighting against the rebelling Kingite Maori . On their defeat in 1864 the M\u0101ori rebels forfeited some of their land. 3% of New Zealand's land was taken, although large areas of this were reserved for Maori and some of the land was never surveyed or occupied and subsequently returned to Maori. Defeat of the rebels was aided by the large flotilla of vessels brought to New Zealand by [[Duncan Alexander Cameron|General Cameron]] in 1863 to operate in the Waikato River. The flotilla comprised shallow draught boats, including gunboats and barges for transporting troops and supplies, as the front line moved progressively south. Many of these vessels were sourced from Australia and captained by experienced Australian officers. Cameron also opened a second maritime link by bringing troops and supplies over the [[Raglan, New Zealand|Raglan]] bar and building a [[redoubt]] at Raglan. Troops were marched over an old Maori trail that was widened by the Forest Rangers to allow access to the area north of [[Pirongia]].<ref>Stowers, Richard and  Binsley, John E.

There was no base in New Zealand.\n\nIn the quarter century from 1845, some twenty [[Royal Navy]] ships took part in actions between M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101, with the colonial government taking up some commercial ships in supporting roles. Another contribution came on loan from [[Australia]], in the form of the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] naval screw steam [[sloop]] [[HMS Victoria (1855)|''Victoria'']], in the first [[First Taranaki War|Taranaki conflict]] of 1860\u201361. They and the [[East Indiaman]] [[HMS Elphinstone|''Elphinstone'']] provided gun and crew, to form militia units for fighting ashore. The ships served mainly as communication, transport and supply links between places of conflict but, more importantly perhaps, also served as real symbols of [[British Empire|British]] authority in areas where conflict was close to breaking out, or already had.<ref name=McDougall161>McDougall (1989) Page 161.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=5 align=\"center\"| '''Royal Navy ships involved in the first New Zealand Wars'''<ref name=\"Dennerly 2002\">Dennerly (2002</ref> \n|-\n! width=\"90\" align=\"left\"|Name\n! width=\"90\" align=\"left\"|Type\n!

In June 1860, [[HMS Pelorus (1857)|HMS ''Pelorus'']], the flagship of the [[History of the Royal Australian Navy#Pre-Federation navies|Australian Squadron]] of the Royal Navy, participated in the attack on Puketakauere [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|''pa'']] during the [[First Taranaki War#The King Movement Intervenes|First Taranaki War]]. Later that year, the crew landed at Kairau to support British troops under attack from M\u0101ori and in January 1861 a gun crew from the ship helped defend the British redoubt at Huirangi against the M\u0101ori.<ref>[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~ausnavy/Military%20Action.htm Naval Military Actions]</ref>\n\nIn 1862, [[HMS Orpheus (1861)|HMS ''Orpheus'']] replaced ''Pelorus'' as flagship of the Australian Squadron. In February 1863, while delivering naval supplies and troop reinforcements to Auckland, ''Orpheus'' was [[HMS Orpheus (1861)#The wreck|wrecked]] on the sandbars at the entrance to [[Manukau Harbour]]. Of the ship's complement of 259, 189 died in the disaster.

A substantial naval dockyard with workshops was set up at Putataka (now [[Port Waikato]]) where the gunboats and barges were built and repaired. The dockyard and other depots were closed down and the flotilla dispersed after the New Zealand Wars ended in 1867.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Type\n!

A further hoax Russian warship attack, this time in Wellington in 1885, was spurred by fears over French, German and Russian policies in the South Pacific, late in 1883.\n\n===Mine-laying steamers===\nAs a contribution to port defences the government ordered a small \"submining\" steamer from Scotland. It was shipped to Wellington for assembly in sections, fitted with a locally made engine, named ''Ellen Ballance'', and went into service about 1884. She was put under the responsibility of army engineers, who gained Engineer Corp status in May 1887.\n\nSubmarine mining was the laying of defensive mines on the seabed about port entrances. In 1898 the New Zealand forces commander advised the government that ''Ellen Ballance'' was dangerous for laying out mines in anything approaching bad weather. He recommended that two \"proper\" submarine minelaying steamers should be acquired, one for Auckland and one for Wellington. This was approved, and in October 1900 the construction of two enlarged [[Robert Napier, 1st Baron Napier of Magdala|Napier of Magdala]] type vessels were ordered. These were named ''Janie Seddon'' and ''Lady Roberts''.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 163-164.</ref>\n\n''Ellen Ballance'' went to Lyttelton soon after being replaced by ''Janie Seddon'', and then to Otago Harbour in October 1905 as transport to RNZ Artillery gun emplacements such as [[Ripapa Island]] and [[Taiaroa Head]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These were built in 1883 by [[John I. Thornycroft & Company|John Thornycroft & Co]], London. They displaced 12 tons and measured 18.2 x 2.3 x 1 m (63 x 7.5 x 3.2 feet). They were powered from a single shaft with a steam locomotive engine generating 173&nbsp;hp (130&nbsp;kW), which give a speed of {{convert|17|kn|km/h}}. Their main weapon was an 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft) spar, projecting well forward over the bow, armed at its tip with an explosive device. A [[Nordenfelt gun]] was also fitted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Boat\n! Name\n! Port\n!

The spar boats were constructed for speed, so they were narrow and shallow, and were armoured with plating only 1.6&nbsp;mm thick. They could not operate in anything like rough water, and using them as attack vessels may well have been as hazardous for the crew as the target. They were obsolete before they were completed, and only the last two had the up-to-date Whitehead \"fish\" torpedo fitted when built.\n\nIn 1884 torpedo boat units were formed to operate them. They were organised in a similar way to the artillery \"Navals\" with appropriate naval uniforms. They were at first called the Torpedo Branch of the Armed Constabulary. Then in June 1887 they were gazetted as a permanent militia and given the formal, but more manageable title, Torpedo Corps. The torpedo boats had galvanized plating, which meant they could not stay in the water and had to be kept on slipways. Each Torpedo Corps had its own quarters and boatshed. Their main role soon became training, and by 1900 they were well out of date.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 164.</ref><ref>[http://www.navy.mil.nz/naval-reserve/naval-reserve-history/default.htm  Naval Reserve History]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.devonport.co.nz/beach.htm |title=Torpedo Bay |access-date=2008-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221065515/http://www.devonport.co.nz/beach.htm |archive-date=2007-12-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Late 1880s \u2013 early 1900s==\n\n===Calliope Dock===\n[[Image:Calliope Dock In Devonport.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Calliope (1884)|HMS ''Calliope'']] and [[HMS Diamond|HMS ''Diamond'']] in the dock during opening ceremonies 1888]]\nAn event that was to have an important bearing on New Zealand naval policy in later years was the official opening on 16 February 1888 of the Calliope [[Drydock#Graving Dock|graving dock]]. This was constructed over three years by the Auckland Harbour Board at Calliope Point on the Devonport shore.\n\nDesigned to take vessels up to {{convert|500|ft|m}}, the dock was the largest in the southern hemisphere. In 1892 the Admiralty acquired from the Harbour Board {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of reclaimed land adjacent to the dock so they could develop naval workshops.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/WH2Navy-fig-WH2Nav08a.html Opening of the Calliope Dock]</ref><ref>Bell (1962)</ref><ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/ships-famous/8 Famous ships: ''Calliope'']</ref>\n\n===Subsidies to the Royal Navy===\nFor years the Royal Navy operated an imperial squadron in Australia called the \"Australian Squadron\". The 1887 Imperial Conference in London lead to a naval agreement that the Australian Squadron would be supplemented by another squadron, a joint Australian and New Zealand naval force of five cruisers and two torpedo gunboats. These ships would be based in Sydney and called the \"Australasian Auxiliary Squadron\". Two ships, one from the Imperial squadron and one from the new squadron, would be stationed in New Zealand waters. An annual subsidy of \u00a3120,000 was to be paid to London by Australia and New Zealand, of which New Zealand's share was \u00a320,000.\n\nThis policy of subsidising Imperial navy forces allowed the Admiralty to retain central control over the navies, yet for New Zealand it guaranteed a cruiser presence in their waters. It also allowed New Zealanders direct entry into the Royal Navy. This arrangement suited both parties and remained in force for the next twenty years. The 1902 [[Imperial Conference]] modified the Naval Agreement and New Zealand's annual subsidy increased to \u00a340,000.<ref>Dennerly (2002) Page 7</ref> The subsidy was further increased in 1908 to \u00a3100,000.\n\n===A training ship===\nIn 1907 the [[Marine Department (New Zealand)|Marine Department]] acquired an 805-ton gun boat and converted her to  New Zealand's first training ship [[NZS Amokura|NZS ''Amokura'']]. Over the next 14 years, 527 boys trained in her, 25 of them going on to naval service and most of the others into the merchant marine.<ref>McDougall (1989) Page 170.</ref><ref>NZ Maritime record: [http://www.nzmaritime.co.nz/amokura.htm NZS ''Amokura'' 1906\u20131955]</ref><ref>Waters (1956): Appendix IX: [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-a9.html Training ship Amokura]</ref>\n\nThe boat was originally a three masted auxiliary barquentine, square rigged on the foremast, fore-and-aft on the after masts. Her hull was composite; carvel teak planking on steel frames.\n\n===Gift of battlecruiser===\n[[File:HMS New Zealand at Adelaide.jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''New Zealand'' at [[Port Adelaide]], May 1919]]\n\nIn 1909, Great Britain was in the middle of a naval and political crisis; Germany had expanded her naval programme and was speeding up the building of ships of all classes. On 22 March 1909 the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir [[Joseph Ward]], made an offer to fund \"one first-class battleship, and if need be, two\" as a gift to the Royal Navy. This offer was accepted by the British Government and the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS ''New Zealand'']] was built by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering|Fairfield]] for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,783,190.<ref>Waters (1956) Appendix VII: [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-a7.html Record of HMS ''New Zealand'']</ref>\n\nThe ''New Zealand'' was commissioned on 23 November 1912 with three New Zealand officers. After being inspected by the King, she sailed on a ten-month world cruise, arriving in [[Wellington]] in April 1913.
