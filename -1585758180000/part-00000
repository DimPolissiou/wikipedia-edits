The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. A [[Confederate Revenue-Marine]] was also formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nAfter the purchase of Alaska in 1867, {{USRC|Lincoln}}, with First Lieutenant George W. Moore aboard was dispatched to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to establish United States sovereignty as agent of the U.S. Collector of Customs in San Francisco.

Congress awarded the three men [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s for \"heroic service rendered\" on 28 June 1902.<ref name=Evans134-139>Evans, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> During the [[Snake River gold rush]] of 1900, the Revenue Cutter Service returned destitute miners to Seattle from Alaska.\n\n===United States Lifesaving Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service]]\nA number of voluntary organizations had formed in coastal communities in the 1700s and early 1800s to assist shipwrecked mariners by means of small boats at shore-based stations, notably the [[Massachusetts Humane Society]] (est. 1758). These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n=== Preparation ===\nThe Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8>Larzelere (2003), p. 8</ref> In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)xvi>Larzelere (2003), p. xvi</ref>  Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant [[Elmer Stone]] to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)138>Larzelere (2003), p. 138</ref> On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve-page manual titled ''Confidential Order No. 2, [[Coast Guard Mobilization Plan 1|Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy]]''.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8 /> Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 30 January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3>Larzelere (2003), p. 3</ref>  U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the [[SS Healdton|SS ''Healdton]] and the [[SS Housatonic|SS ''Housatonic'']] and five others with the loss of 36 American lives.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3-6>Larzelere (2003), pp. 3\u20146</ref>\n\n=== Declaration of war ===\n[[File:USCGC Tampa in port c1918.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USCGC ''Tampa'']] in port]]\nOn 6 April 1917, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy. All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. During the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=Tilley>Tilley, A History of Women in the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office</ref><ref name=\"womensmemorial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |title=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |publisher=Womensmemorial.org |date=1950-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, {{USCGC|Tampa|1912|6}} parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar. Ordered to put into [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], she proceeded independently toward her destination.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)47>Larzelere (2003), p. 47</ref> At 1930 that evening, as she transited the [[Bristol Channel]], the warship was spotted by {{SMU|UB-91||2}}. According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n==The 1920s==\n\n===Post-war struggle to remain a separate armed service===\nIn 1920 the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce held hearings on merging the recently created Coast Guard into the United States Navy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdguAAAAMAAJ|title=Transfer of the Coast Guard to the Navy: Hearings Before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, Sixty-sixth Congress, Second Session, on H.R. 5516.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932. In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

Coast Guard cutters and ships partially crewed by Coast Guardsmen were used in the North African invasion of November 1942 ([[Operation Torch]]) and the invasion of [[Sicily]] in 1943 ([[Operation Husky]]). Coast Guard crews staffed 22 tankers, 51 [[List of ships of the United States Army#Large Tug (LT)|large tugs]], 6 [[List of ships of the United States Army#Seacraft Repair Ship|marine repair ships]], and 209 [[List of ships of the United States Army#FS (freight and supply vessels)|freight and supply vessels]] for the [[United States Army]].<ref name=mfw/>\n\nOn 9 September 1942 the [[USS Muskeget (AG-48)|USCGC ''Muskget'' (WAG-48)]] was sunk with a loss of 121 crewmembers while on North Atlantic weather patrol by U-755.\n\nIn November 1942, legislation was passed creating the Coast Guard Women's Reserve, also known as the [[SPARS]].

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

On 9 August 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 679, known as the [[Magnuson Act]].  This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.

The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam.

This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''.

As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]]. [[Port Security Unit]]s and [[Naval Coastal Warfare]] units also accompanied the U.S. military buildup.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:US Coast Guard Transportable Port Security Unit.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Port Security Unit patrols Umm Qasr]]\nDuring [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the Coast Guard had deployed its largest contingent of Coast Guardsmen and assets overseas since the Vietnam War.

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]].

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n=== Preparation ===\nThe Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8>Larzelere (2003), p. 8</ref> In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)xvi>Larzelere (2003), p. xvi</ref>  Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant [[Elmer Stone]] to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)138>Larzelere (2003), p. 138</ref> On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve-page manual titled ''Confidential Order No. 2, [[Coast Guard Mobilization Plan 1|Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy]]''.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8 /> Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 30 January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3>Larzelere (2003), p. 3</ref>  U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the [[SS Healdton|SS ''Healdton]] and the [[SS Housatonic|SS ''Housatonic'']] and five others with the loss of 36 American lives.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3-6>Larzelere (2003), pp. 3\u20146</ref>\n\n=== Declaration of war ===\n[[File:USCGC Tampa in port c1918.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USCGC ''Tampa'']] in port]]\nOn 6 April 1917, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy. All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. During the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=Tilley>Tilley, A History of Women in the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office</ref><ref name=\"womensmemorial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |title=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |publisher=Womensmemorial.org |date=1950-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, {{USCGC|Tampa|1912|6}} parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".

In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

These stages of integration preceded the DOD military by roughly a year or so, as separate legislation restricted their deployment of women.<ref name=USCGHO7>{{cite web|last=Tilley|first=John A.|title=A History of Women in the Coast Guard|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/WomeninCG.pdf|work=Commandant's Bulletin (March 1996)|publisher=US Coast Guard Historians Office|accessdate=21 October 2012|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nAltogether, the shift from Treasury to the DOT in 1967, the uniform change, the end of Ocean Station service, growth of the shore-side establishment by newly added missions, the steady if belated retirement of venerable but aging World War II cutters, and gender integration marked the oft-lamented end of the \"Old Guard\" (\"wooden ships and men of steel\").\n\nThe [[Ancient Order of the Pterodactyl]] was founded in 1977 in order to preserve the history of Coast Guard aviation, as the service's last amphibious seaplane, the [[HU-16 Albatross|Grumman Albatross]] or \"Goat,\" was nearing retirement, as was also the service's last enlisted pilot, John P. Greathouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/donboyd/image/59585407|title=IN MEMORIAM for ADCMAP John Pershing Greathouse, USCG \u2013 the last enlisted Coastie pilot by Don Boyd|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredsplace.org/obit/obituary.shtml|title=Military and Veteran Benefits, News, Veteran Jobs|first=|last=Military.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===End of ocean stations, beginning of the {{convert|200|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} limit===\nOne major mission of the service, maintaining [[weather ship|Ocean Stations]], came to an end as improvements in oceanic aviation (turbojet airliners and improved radionavigation) obviated the need. However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees. The aircraft sank within 90 seconds.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GnmwMBeSLzAC |title= Adak: The Rescue of Alfa Foxtrot 586 |first=Andrew |last= Jampoler |publisher= Naval Institute Press |year= 2012 |ISBN= 9781612510743}}</ref>\n\nThe crew of Coast Guard HC-130H CGNR 1500 were instrumental in saving the lives of ten crew members from Navy P3C PD-2 \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\" (Bureau No. 159892) after that aircraft ditched in the North Pacific Ocean west of Shemya Island on 26 October 1978. Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range.

Although the program involves obtaining new ships and aircraft, Deepwater also involves upgraded information technology for command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\nA key part of the Deepwater system is the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), which is designed to replace the 378-foot (115 m) high-endurance cutters currently on duty.  This ship will have a length of 421 feet (128 m), be powered by a [[gas turbine]] engine with two auxiliary [[diesel engine]]s, and be capable of 12,000 nautical mile (22,000&nbsp;km) voyages lasting up to 60 days.  The keel laying of the {{USCGC|Bertholf}} (WMSL-750), the first ship in this class, took place in September 2004. The ship was delivered in 2008. The second keel, {{USCGC|Waesche|WMSL-751}}, was laid in 2005.\n\nAnother key vessel is the Maritime Security Cutter, Medium (WMSM), which will be 341&nbsp;ft (104 m) long, displace 2,921 long tons (2,968 metric tons), and be capable of 45-day patrols of up to 9,000 nautical miles (17,000&nbsp;km).

The song was adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance: by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n\"Bella Ciao\" was originally sung as \"''Alla mattina appena alzata''\" by [[Seasonal industry|seasonal]] workers of paddy fields of [[rice]], (Mihir Shah)especially in Italy's [[Po Valley]] from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century with different lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7m_91aU1TYC&pg=PA43&dq=bella+ciao#v=onepage&q=bella+ciao&f=false|title=Songs That Made History Around the World|first=JERRY|last=SILVERMAN|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781610650168}}</ref> They worked at [[wikt: mondare|monda]] ([[weeding]]) the rice fields in northern Italy, to help the healthy growth of young rice plants. It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. Monda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

The song was adopted as an anthem of the [[anti-fascist]] resistance: by the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] between 1943 and 1945 during the [[Italian Resistance]], the resistance of Italian partisans against the [[Nazi German]] forces occupying Italy, during the [[Italian Civil War]], and the Italian partisan struggle against the fascist [[Italian Social Republic]] and its Nazi German allies. Versions of \"Bella ciao\" are sung worldwide as an anti-fascist hymn of freedom and resistance.\n\n==History==\n\"Bella Ciao\" was originally sung as \"''Alla mattina appena alzata''\" by [[Seasonal industry|seasonal]] workers of paddy fields of [[rice]], especially in Italy's [[Po Valley]] from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century with different lyrics.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G7m_91aU1TYC&pg=PA43&dq=bella+ciao#v=onepage&q=bella+ciao&f=false|title=Songs That Made History Around the World|first=JERRY|last=SILVERMAN|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781610650168}}</ref> They worked at [[wikt: mondare|monda]] ([[weeding]]) the rice fields in northern Italy, to help the healthy growth of young rice plants. It took place during the flooding of the fields, from the end of April to the beginning of June every year, during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected, during the first stages of their development, from temperature differences between the day and the night. It consisted of two phases: transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds. Monda was an extremely tiring task, carried out mostly by women known as mondinas, from the poorest social classes. They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees, and their back bent for many hours. The atrocious working conditions, long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and led, at times, to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the twentieth century. The struggles against the supervising ''padroni'' was even harder, with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work. Besides \"Bella ciao\", similar songs by the mondina women included \"''[[:it:Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi|Sciur padrun da li beli braghi bianchi]]''{{-\"}} and \"''[[:it:Se otto ore vi sembran poche|Se otto ore vi sembran poche]]''{{-\"}}.\n\nOther similar versions of the antecedents of \"Bella ciao\" appeared over the years, indicating that \"Alla mattina appena alzata\" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bermani\">{{cite book | title=Guerra guerra ai palazzi e alle chiese | publisher=Odradek Edizioni | year=2003 | author=Bermani, Cesare}}</ref> The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near [[Vercelli]], [[Piedmont]].<ref>D.

Madero was notable for challenging long-time Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nBorn into an extremely wealthy family in [[Coahuila]], northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, twentieth-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party and urged Mexicans to oust D\u00edaz in the 1910 election. Madero's candidacy against D\u00edaz garnered widespread support in Mexico. He was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose D\u00edaz when it was dangerous to do so.<ref>Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.</ref> D\u00edaz had Madero arrested before the elections, which were then seen as fraudulent.  Madero escaped from prison and issued the [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]] from the United States. For the first time, he called for an armed uprising against the illegitimately-elected D\u00edaz, and outlined a  program of reform. The armed phase of the Mexican Revolution dates to his plan.\n\nUprisings in Morelos under [[Emiliano Zapata]] and in Mexico's north by [[Pascual Orozco]], [[Pancho Villa]] and others and the inability of Mexican [[Federal Army]] to suppress them forced D\u00edaz's resignation on 25 May 1911, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Madero was enormously popular among many sectors, but he did not assume the presidency.  An interim president was installed and elections were scheduled for fall 1911. Madero was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38.\n\nMadero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from conservatives. He did not move quickly on land reform, which was a key demand of many of his supporters. Former supporters Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the [[Plan of Ayala]] as Pascual Orozco did in his Plan Orozquista.  These were significant challenges to Madero's presidency. Labor also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Foreign entrepreneurs were concerned that Madero was unable to maintain political stability that would keep their investments safe. Foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten the international order.\n\nIn February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Tr\u00e1gica''). In death, Madero became a unifying force of disparate elements in Mexico opposed to the regime of Huerta.  In the north, governor of Coahuila [[Venustiano Carranza]] led what became the [[Constitutionalist Army]] against Huerta, while Zapata continued in his rebellion under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the opposition coalition held together by Madero's memory dissolved and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.\n\n==Early Years (1873\u20131903)==\n===Family background===\nMadero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245\u201346.</ref> It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&catid=3:revolucion&Itemid=13|title=Revoluci\u00f3n / Francisco I. Madero: con \"I\" de Ignacio, por Alejandro Rosas|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.bicentenario.gob.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis family has been described as one of the five wealthiest families in Mexico. His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, began as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to Mexican ports during the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, Evaristo first married Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez Lombra\u00f1a, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hern\u00e1ndez. Alongside his brother-in-law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&nbsp;million U.S. dollars<ref>Ross, Stanley R. ''Francisco I. Madero, Apostle of Democracy''. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, 3.</ref> of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). Much of this wealth arose from the diversification of Madero lands during the 1890s into the production of ''guayule'' rubber plants.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/110 110]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1. Porfirians, Liberals and Peasants|ISBN=0-8032-7770-9|url=https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/110}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, and having built his success, Evaristo Madero remarried to Do\u00f1a Manuela de Far\u00edas Benavides, member of one of northern Mexico's most aristocratic families, daughter of Don Juan Francisco de Far\u00edas, mayor of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. Evaristo Madero also served as governor of Coahuila from 1880 to 1884,<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 4.</ref> during the four-year [[interregnum]] of Porfirio D\u00edaz's rule. Afterwards, Evaristo was permanently sidelined from political office when D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. Evaristo Madero's two marriages were fruitful, with a total of 18 children, 14 of whom would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/55 55]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1.

Madero.]]\nFrancisco and his brother [[Gustavo A. Madero]] attended the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Saltillo]], but his early Catholic education had little lasting impact. As a young man, his father sent him to carry out preparatory studies at the [[Culver Academies]] in the [[United States]] and later at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in [[Versailles]], [[France]], where he completed the [[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]] program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC).\n\nHis father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]].\n\nFollowing [[business school]], Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] ideas of [[Annie Besant]], which were prominent at nearby [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 247.</ref>\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Francisco Indalecio Madero cph.3b47072.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco I. Madero with his wife, Sara P\u00e9rez.]]\nIn 1893, the 20-year-old Madero returned to Mexico and assumed management of the Madero family's [[hacienda]] at [[San Pedro, Coahuila]].

He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nAlready well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he had built a personal fortune of over 500,000 pesos<ref name=\"Knight 56\"/> by 1899.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\"/> The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed him as someone who should be under the authority of his elders. As the eldest sibling, Francisco exercised authority over his younger brothers and sisters.<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', pp. 15\u201316.</ref> In January 1903, he married Sara P\u00e9rez, first in a civil ceremony, and then a Catholic nuptial mass celebrated by the archbishop.<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I.

Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act.<ref>Madero had another brother, also named Ra\u00fal, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.</ref> The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.</ref> Madero founded the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the D\u00edaz government. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Dem\u00f3crata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in the 1905 governmental elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908\u20131909)===\n[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (1830\u20131915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]\nIn an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\n\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251\u2013253.</ref> This book, published in late 1908, was titled ''La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n'' (\"Effective Suffrage. No Re-election\"). Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252\u2013253.</ref>\n\n[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|right|\"Manifestaci\u00f3n antireeleccionista\" by [[Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada]].]]\n\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 253\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.</ref> In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serd\u00e1n]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.<ref>LaFrance, David G. \"Aquiles Serd\u00e1n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341.

In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero's own in correspondence. A political solution and compromise might have been possible, with Madero withdrawing his candidacy.<ref name=\"Ross, p. 100\">Ross, ''Francisco I.

Resentful of the \"peaceful invasion\" from the United States \"which came to control 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land,\" Mexico's poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Zeit |first=Joshua |date=4 February 2017 |title=The Last Time the U.S. Invaded Mexico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/the-last-time-the-us-invaded-mexico-214738 |magazine=Politico Magazine |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in [[Monterrey]] and sent him to a prison in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed City|San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\n\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 7 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. He was then smuggled across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.\n\n===Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed and rebellion===\n{{Main|Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed}}\n[[File:Roque Gonzalez y Madero.jpg|thumb|Madero (center) in San Antonio, Texas while in exile]]\n[[File:Madero (and) Pascual Orozco.

The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero's policies painted him as a leader of each of the different castes in Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution: A Brief History with Documents|last=Wasserman|first=Mark|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2012|isbn=978-0-312-53504-9|location=Boston, MA|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A.

However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting, but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[M\u00e1ximo Castillo]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=M\u00e1ximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=M\u00e1ximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Vald\u00e9s|editor-first=Jes\u00fas Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}</ref> He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].\n\nOn 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-President [[Ram\u00f3n Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&nbsp;\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that D\u00edaz could no longer retain power.  On 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] was signed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.\n\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911, escorted into exile by General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"''\u00a1Viva Madero!''\"\n\n===Interim Presidency of De la Barra (May\u2013November 1911)===\n[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] (1863\u20131939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]\n[[File:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco I. Madero campaigning in [[Cuernavaca]], June 1911 and meeting [[Emiliano Zapata]]. Zapata rebelled in 1911, because of President Madero's slowness to implement land reform.|alt=|261x261px]]\n\nAlthough Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the Interim Presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the D\u00edaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, [[Paul von Hintze]], who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party....\"<ref>quoted in [[Friedrich Katz]], ''The Secret War in Mexico''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, pp. 40-41.</ref> Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of D\u00edaz, but by calling for the disarming anddemobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state.  Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\n\nWith Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"[[Attila]] of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\n\n===Madero presidency (November 1911 \u2013 February 1913)===\n[[File:Presidente_Francisco_I._Madero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francisco I.

A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1171-did-you-know-the-world-s-first-aerial-bombing-the-battle-of-topolobampo-mexico|title=Did You Know?

Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.\n\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to harshly criticize Madero's performance as president. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\"  President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.\n\nDespite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the D\u00edaz government, which appointed local political bosses (''jefes pol\u00edticos''), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women's and children's labor.  Unions were granted the right to freely organize. The ''[[Casa del Obrero Mundial]]'' (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] was founded during his presidency.<ref>Tortolero Cervantes,. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 766-67.</ref>\n\nMadero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Su\u00e1rez.<ref>LaFrance, David. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, p. 488.</ref>\n\n====Rebellions====\nMadero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces.  For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that D\u00edaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua.  A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero's presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.\n\n=====Zapatista rebellion=====\nIn Morelos, [[Emiliano Zapata]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Ayala]] on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero's slowness on land reform. Zapata's plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912.\n\n=====Reyes rebellion=====\nIn December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes's rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].\n[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850\u20131916), general who fought the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912.

Madero dispatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide and General [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\n\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.<ref>Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212</ref> Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\n\n=====F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz rebellion=====\nOctober 1912, [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], \"to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero.\" This rebellion was quickly crushed and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.\n\n==Ten Tragic Days and death of Madero==\n{{Main|Ten Tragic Days}}\n[[File:Madero_1913.png|thumb|250px|President Madero riding the streets near the Palace, acclaimed by his supporters, a few days before his tragic end.]]\n[[File:Dead outside National Palace during one of the outbreaks, Mexico City.jpg|280px|thumbnail|The National Palace, the target of the rebel artillery fire from the nearby arsenal.

Now known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], from 9 February to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (''ciudadela''). Madero's loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero's commander, General [[Victoriano Huerta]] secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero's decision to appoint General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as commander of forces in Mexico City was one \"for which he would pay for with his life.\"<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> Madero and his vice president were arrested.  Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President D\u00edaz in May 1911. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Madero Vivo''. Mexico City: Clio, pp. 119-21</ref>\n\nFollowing his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/489 489]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution!

Among elites in Mexico, Madero's death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since D\u00edaz's resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime.<ref>[[Alan Knight (historian)|Knight, Alan]]. ''The Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, pp. 1-2.</ref> In northern Mexico, Madero's overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta's usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, [[Venustiano Carranza]] refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the [[Constitutionalist Army]] fought for the principles of constitutional democracry that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime.  However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero's anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz.  Madero's overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.\n\n==Historical memory and popular culture==\n[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|left|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]\n[[File:Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexico.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City, final resting place of Madero and other revolutionaries]]\n[[File:Francisco I.

Austin: University of Texas Press 2000, p. 50</ref>\n\nDespite Madero's importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the [[Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n|Monument to the Revolution]] was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place.  He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City. After his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (February 22) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed (November 20), which launched the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Benjamin,  ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 124</ref> Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries.  Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', pp. 131-32.</ref>\n\nThe date of Madero's Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, November 20, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, [[Revolution Day (Mexico)|Revolution Day]], but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the Presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored November 20 and commemorated March 26, the anniversary of his [[Plan de Guadalupe]].<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 59</ref>\n\n[[File:Street sign Mexico city - FCO I Madero - 3.jpg|thumbnail|Modern street sign and plaque with the former name of the section, ''Calle de Plateros''.]]\nThe [[Mexico City Metro]] has a stop named for Madero's vice president, [[Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez]], but not one to Madero.

One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City towards the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] would be named for Madero. Still officially called [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue]], but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city.

Madero was notable for challenging long-time Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nBorn into an extremely wealthy family in [[Coahuila]], northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, twentieth-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party and urged Mexicans to oust D\u00edaz in the 1910 election. Madero's candidacy against D\u00edaz garnered widespread support in Mexico. He was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose D\u00edaz when it was dangerous to do so.<ref>Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.</ref> D\u00edaz had Madero arrested before the elections, which were then seen as fraudulent.  Madero escaped from prison and issued the [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]] from the United States. For the first time, he called for an armed uprising against the illegitimately-elected D\u00edaz, and outlined a  program of reform. The armed phase of the Mexican Revolution dates to his plan.\n\nUprisings in Morelos under [[Emiliano Zapata]] and in Mexico's north by [[Pascual Orozco]], [[Pancho Villa]] and others and the inability of Mexican [[Federal Army]] to suppress them forced D\u00edaz's resignation on 25 May 1911, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Madero was enormously popular among many sectors, but he did not assume the presidency.  An interim president was installed and elections were scheduled for fall 1911. Madero was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38.\n\nMadero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from conservatives. He did not move quickly on land reform, which was a key demand of many of his supporters. Former supporters Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the [[Plan of Ayala]] as Pascual Orozco did in his Plan Orozquista.  These were significant challenges to Madero's presidency. Labor also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Foreign entrepreneurs were concerned that Madero was unable to maintain political stability that would keep their investments safe. Foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten the international order.\n\nIn February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Tr\u00e1gica''). In death, Madero became a unifying force of disparate elements in Mexico opposed to the regime of Huerta.  In the north, governor of Coahuila [[Venustiano Carranza]] led what became the [[Constitutionalist Army]] against Huerta, while Zapata continued in his rebellion under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the opposition coalition held together by Madero's memory dissolved and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.\n\n==Early Years (1873\u20131903)==\n===Family background===\nMadero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245\u201346.</ref> It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&catid=3:revolucion&Itemid=13|title=Revoluci\u00f3n / Francisco I.

His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, began as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to Mexican ports during the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, Evaristo first married Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez Lombra\u00f1a, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hern\u00e1ndez. Alongside his brother-in-law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&nbsp;million U.S. dollars<ref>Ross, Stanley R. ''Francisco I. Madero, Apostle of Democracy''. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, 3.</ref> of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). Much of this wealth arose from the diversification of Madero lands during the 1890s into the production of ''guayule'' rubber plants.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/110 110]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1.

Evaristo Madero also served as governor of Coahuila from 1880 to 1884,<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 4.</ref> during the four-year [[interregnum]] of Porfirio D\u00edaz's rule. Afterwards, Evaristo was permanently sidelined from political office when D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. Evaristo Madero's two marriages were fruitful, with a total of 18 children, 14 of whom would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/55 55]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1.

As a young man, his father sent him to carry out preparatory studies at the [[Culver Academies]] in the [[United States]] and later at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in [[Versailles]], [[France]], where he completed the [[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]] program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC).\n\nHis father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]].\n\nFollowing [[business school]], Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English.

He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation.

Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act.<ref>Madero had another brother, also named Ra\u00fal, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.</ref> The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.</ref> Madero founded the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the D\u00edaz government. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Dem\u00f3crata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in the 1905 governmental elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908\u20131909)===\n[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (1830\u20131915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]\nIn an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\n\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251\u2013253.</ref> This book, published in late 1908, was titled ''La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n'' (\"Effective Suffrage. No Re-election\"). Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252\u2013253.</ref>\n\n[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|right|\"Manifestaci\u00f3n antireeleccionista\" by [[Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada]].]]\n\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 253\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.</ref> In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serd\u00e1n]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.<ref>LaFrance, David G. \"Aquiles Serd\u00e1n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341.

In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

Resentful of the \"peaceful invasion\" from the United States \"which came to control 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land,\" Mexico's poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Zeit |first=Joshua |date=4 February 2017 |title=The Last Time the U.S. Invaded Mexico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/the-last-time-the-us-invaded-mexico-214738 |magazine=Politico Magazine |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in [[Monterrey]] and sent him to a prison in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed City|San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\n\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 7 October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. He was then smuggled across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.\n\n===Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed and rebellion===\n{{Main|Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed}}\n[[File:Roque Gonzalez y Madero.jpg|thumb|Madero (center) in San Antonio, Texas while in exile]]\n[[File:Madero (and) Pascual Orozco.

The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero's policies painted him as a leader of each of the different castes in Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution: A Brief History with Documents|last=Wasserman|first=Mark|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2012|isbn=978-0-312-53504-9|location=Boston, MA|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A.

However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting, but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[M\u00e1ximo Castillo]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=M\u00e1ximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=M\u00e1ximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Vald\u00e9s|editor-first=Jes\u00fas Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}</ref> He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].\n\nOn 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-President [[Ram\u00f3n Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&nbsp;\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that D\u00edaz could no longer retain power.  On 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] was signed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.\n\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911, escorted into exile by General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"''\u00a1Viva Madero!''\"\n\n===Interim Presidency of De la Barra (May\u2013November 1911)===\n[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] (1863\u20131939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]\n[[File:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco I. Madero campaigning in [[Cuernavaca]], June 1911 and meeting [[Emiliano Zapata]]. Zapata rebelled in 1911, because of President Madero's slowness to implement land reform.|alt=|261x261px]]\n\nAlthough Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the Interim Presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the D\u00edaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, [[Paul von Hintze]], who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party....\"<ref>quoted in [[Friedrich Katz]], ''The Secret War in Mexico''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, pp. 40-41.</ref> Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of D\u00edaz, but by calling for the disarming anddemobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state.  Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\n\nWith Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"[[Attila]] of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\n\n===Madero presidency (November 1911 \u2013 February 1913)===\n[[File:Presidente_Francisco_I._Madero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francisco I.

A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1171-did-you-know-the-world-s-first-aerial-bombing-the-battle-of-topolobampo-mexico|title=Did You Know?

Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.\n\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to harshly criticize Madero's performance as president. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\"  President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.\n\nDespite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the D\u00edaz government, which appointed local political bosses (''jefes pol\u00edticos''), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women's and children's labor.  Unions were granted the right to freely organize. The ''[[Casa del Obrero Mundial]]'' (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] was founded during his presidency.<ref>Tortolero Cervantes,. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 766-67.</ref>\n\nMadero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Su\u00e1rez.<ref>LaFrance, David. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, p. 488.</ref>\n\n====Rebellions====\nMadero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces.  For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that D\u00edaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua.  A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero's presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.\n\n=====Zapatista rebellion=====\nIn Morelos, [[Emiliano Zapata]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Ayala]] on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero's slowness on land reform. Zapata's plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912.\n\n=====Reyes rebellion=====\nIn December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes's rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].\n[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850\u20131916), general who fought the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912.

Madero dispatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide and General [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\n\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.<ref>Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212</ref> Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\n\n=====F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz rebellion=====\nOctober 1912, [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], \"to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero.\" This rebellion was quickly crushed and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.\n\n==Ten Tragic Days and death of Madero==\n{{Main|Ten Tragic Days}}\n[[File:Madero_1913.png|thumb|250px|President Madero riding the streets near the Palace, acclaimed by his supporters, a few days before his tragic end.]]\n[[File:Dead outside National Palace during one of the outbreaks, Mexico City.jpg|280px|thumbnail|The National Palace, the target of the rebel artillery fire from the nearby arsenal.

Now known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], from 9 February to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (''ciudadela''). Madero's loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero's commander, General [[Victoriano Huerta]] secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero's decision to appoint General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as commander of forces in Mexico City was one \"for which he would pay for with his life.\"<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> Madero and his vice president were arrested.  Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President D\u00edaz in May 1911. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the streetion , tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Madero Vivo''. Mexico City: Clio, pp. 119-21</ref>\n\nFollowing his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/489 489]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution! Mexico 1910\u201320'', pp. 142\u2013143, 586 03669 5</ref> This account was treated with general disbelief, although the American ambassador [[Henry Lane Wilson]], a strong supporter of Huerta, reported to Washington that, \"I am disposed to accept the (Huerta) government's version of the affair and consider it a closed incident\".<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution! Mexico 1910\u201320'', page 144, 586 03669 5</ref>\n\nPresident Madero, dead at 39, was buried quietly in the French cemetery of Mexico City.

Ambassador Wilson was later dismissed from his position after US president Woodrow Wilson took office. Following Huerta's overthrow, Francisco C\u00e1rdenas fled to Guatemala where he committed suicide in 1920 after the new Mexican government had requested his extradition to stand trial for the murder of Madero.<ref>Aitken, Ronald.

Among elites in Mexico, Madero's death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since D\u00edaz's resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime.<ref>[[Alan Knight (historian)|Knight, Alan]]. ''The Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, pp. 1-2.</ref> In northern Mexico, Madero's overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta's usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, [[Venustiano Carranza]] refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the [[Constitutionalist Army]] fought for the principles of constitutional democracry that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime.  However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero's anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz.  Madero's overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.\n\n==Historical memory and popular culture==\n[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|left|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]\n[[File:Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexico.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City, final resting place of Madero and other revolutionaries]]\n[[File:Francisco I. Madero frente al Palacio de Bellas Artes - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Statue of Madero in front of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City.]]\n\nMadero was known as \"The Apostle of Democracy,\" but \"Madero the martyr meant more to the soul of Mexico.\"<ref>quoted in Benjamin, Thomas. ''La Revoluci\u00f3n: Mexico's Great Revolution as Memory, Myth, and History''. Austin: University of Texas Press 2000, p. 50</ref>\n\nDespite Madero's importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the [[Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n|Monument to the Revolution]] was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place.  He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City. After his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (February 22) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed (November 20), which launched the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Benjamin,  ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 124</ref> Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries.  Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', pp. 131-32.</ref>\n\nThe date of Madero's Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, November 20, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, [[Revolution Day (Mexico)|Revolution Day]], but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the Presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored November 20 and commemorated March 26, the anniversary of his [[Plan de Guadalupe]].<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 59</ref>\n\n[[File:Street sign Mexico city - FCO I Madero - 3.jpg|thumbnail|Modern street sign and plaque with the former name of the section, ''Calle de Plateros''.]]\nThe [[Mexico City Metro]] has a stop named for Madero's vice president, [[Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez]], but not one to Madero. General [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] laid a foundation stone on the 10th anniversary of Madero's death of a planned Madero statue in the z\u00f3calo, but the statue was never built.  A statue was erected in 1956 at a downtown intersection in Mexico City and has been moved to the presidential residence, [[Los Pinos]], not easily viewable by the public.<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'' pp. 124, 195</ref> An exception is Avenida Madero in Mexico City. One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City towards the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] would be named for Madero. Still officially called [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue]], but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city. It was [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrianised]] in 2009.\n\nMexican artist [[Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada]] created an [[etching]] for a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/artgallery/exhibitions/2001/posada/Porfiriato/C50.html|title=C50 Calavera de D.
