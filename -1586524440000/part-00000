A rakshasi is a black skinned woman. Rakshasa Varna refers to black colour. As per varnashrama dharma of the Brahmins, rakshasas are dasyus or slaves. Some times the term is exaggerated to mean a monster.    '''Rakshasa''' ({{lang-sa|\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938}}, {{IAST|r\u0101k\u1e63asa}}) is a [[humanoid]] being in [[Hindu mythology]]. As this mythology influenced other religions, the rakshasa was later incorporated into [[Buddhism]]. Rakshasas are also called \"Maneaters\" (''Nri-chakshas,'' ''Kravyads''). A female rakshasa is known as a '''Rakshasi'''. A female Rakshasa in human form is a '''Rakshesha'''.

There were both good and evil rakshasas, and as warriors they fought alongside the armies of both good and evil. They were powerful warriors, expert magicians and illusionists. As shape-changers, they could assume different physical forms. As illusionists, they were capable of creating appearances which were real to those who believed in them or who failed to dispel them. Some of the rakshasas were said to be man-eaters, and made their gleeful appearance when the slaughter on a battlefield was at its worst. Occasionally they served as rank-and-file soldiers in the service of one or another warlord.\n\nAside from its treatment of unnamed rank-and-file Rakshasas, the epics tell the stories of certain members of the \"race\" who rose to prominence, some of them as heroes, most of them as villains.\n\n====In the ''Ramayana''====\nThe Battle of Lanka pitted an army of Rakshasas under [[Ravana]] against an army of [[Vanara]]s, under [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]].\n[[File:Ravana British Museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Ravana]] the king of [[Lanka]] with ten heads, was the commander of Rakshasas.]]\n[[File:Maruti slew Jambumali with one stroke of an iron rod.jpg|thumb|[[Hanuman|Maruti]] slew Jambumali the commander, with one stroke of an iron rod]]\n\n* [[Ravana]] was the King of Lanka. He had ten heads and was the commander of the Rakshasas. He was the immortal enemy of [[Rama]], the hero of the ''[[Ramayana]].'' In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book III: Vana Parva, Section 271 ff.), the Sage [[Markandeya]] recounts the story of how Ravana kidnapped Rama's wife [[Sita]] and whisked her off to his stronghold Lanka. Rama, aided by the monkey King [[Sugriva]] and his army of monkeys, laid siege to Lanka, slew Ravana, and rescued Sita.\n* [[Vibhishana]] was [[Ravana]]'s younger brother. He was beautiful, pious and assiduous in his religious observances. When [[Brahma]] granted him a boon, he asked never to swerve from the path of righteousness and to always be illumined by divine knowledge (Book III, Vana Parva: Section 273.) Vibhishana joined [[Rama]] in his campaign against Ravana and helped Rama's army to cross the ocean into Lanka (Section 281). When invisible Rakshasas infiltrated Rama's camp, Vibhishana caused them to become visible; this enabled Rama's monkey soldiers to destroy them (Section 283). After Rama's final victory over Ravana, the loyal Vibhishana was made king of Lanka and remaining Rakshasas (Section 289).\n* [[Kumbhakarna]] was another brother of [[Ravana]]; he was sometimes referred to as a Rakshasa because of his frightening appearance and size. Like Rakshasas, he had an enormous appetite and ate large quantities of food and meat. A fearsome warrior and master of illusion, he slept through most of the Battle of Lanka (having long before requested and received a gift of long-lasting sleep from [[Brahma]]). When Ravana awakened him with alarming news about the conflict, he arose and took the field. Upon marching out of the city, Kumbhakarna was immediately swarmed by [[Rama]]'s monkeys; he just laughed and wreaked great mayhem amidst them. When the monkey king [[Sugriva]] attacked, Kumbhakarna grabbed him and started to drag him off. At that point [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]] used arrows and a secret ''[[Brahmastra]]'' (\"Brahma's weapon\") to kill [[Kumbhakarna]], dropping him \"like a huge tree cleft in twain by a thunderbolt.\" (''Ramayana,'' Book III: Vana Parva, Section 285.)\n\nOther Rakshasas that are featured in the Ramayana include [[Kabandha]], [[Tataka]] (sometimes called Taraka), [[Shurpanakha]], [[Maricha]], [[Subahu]], [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]], [[Prahasta]], [[Akshayakumara]], [[Atikaya]], and [[Indrajit]] - the most powerful son of [[Ravana]].\n\n====In the Mahabharata====\nThe [[Pandava]] hero [[Bhima]] was the nemesis of forest-dwelling Rakshasas who dined on human travellers and terrorized human settlements.\n* Bhima killed [[Hidimba]], a cannibal Rakshasa. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 154) describes him as a cruel cannibal with sharp, long teeth and prodigious strength. When Hidimba saw the Pandavas sleeping in his forest, he decided to eat them. He sent his sister [[Hidimbi]] to reconnoiter the situation, and the young woman fell in love with the handsome Bhima, whom she warned of danger. Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.\n[[File:Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba.jpg|thumb|Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba]]\n\n* [[Ghatotkacha]], a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasa Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son's name refers to his round bald head; ''ghata'' means 'pot' and ''utkacha'' means 'head' in [[Sanskrit]]. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. His wife was [[Ahilawati]] and his son was [[Barbarika]].\n\nIn the ''Mahabharata,'' Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of [[Jayadratha]], when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King [[Bhagadatta]], and [[Ashwatthama|Aswatthaman]], the son of [[Drona]]), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero [[Karna]]. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader [[Duryodhana]] had appealed to his best fighter, [[Karna]], to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, [[Shakti]], granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy [[Arjuna]], the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor [[Krishna]] smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the ''Shakta'' divine weapon. A temple in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the [[Hidimba Devi Temple]].\n* [[Bakasura]] was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local [[Brahmin]] family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 159-166.)\n* [[Kirmira]], the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 11).\n* [[Jatasura]] was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], attempted to steal the Pandavas' weapons and to ravish [[Draupadi]], wife of [[Arjuna]]. Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156). Jatasur's son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the [[Kaurava]]s at [[Kurukshetra]].\n\n[[File:Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha.jpg|thumb|Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha]]\nRakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.\n\n* [[Alambusha]] was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the ''Mahabharata'', he fought on the side of the Kauravas. [[Arjuna]] defeated him in a duel (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 167), as did Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] (Book VI: Bhishma Parva, Section 101\u2013102). But Alamvusha in turn killed [[Iravan]], Arjuna's son by a [[N\u0101ga]] princess [[Ulupi]], when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of [[Garuda]]. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 107). He was slain by Bhima's son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 108).\n\n==In Buddhist lore==\n===Theravada Buddhist literature===\nIn the Maha Samaya Sutta, [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (also known as ''Namuci'' or the \"Dark One\") is the defeated antagonist of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He is described as a corrupted Asura, whose army consisted of \"Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others\" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.\n\nThe Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12) of the [[P\u0101li Canon]] recounts a story in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was harassed by a Rakshasa. The latter asked him to leave and then to return, over and over. When the Buddha refused to leave, the Rakshasa threatened to harm him if he could not answer his questions. The rest of the sutta concerns the question and answer dialogue. At the end, the rakshasa is convinced of the Buddha's holiness and becomes a follower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn10/sn10.012.piya.html|title=Alavaka Sutta: Discourse to Alavaka|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]]n (Sinhala) ancestral legends refer to Yakshas as well.\n\nOne of Buddha's ten titles is \u201cPurisa Dama Sarati sata deva manusanam Buddho baghavati\u201d meaning the teacher of gods, men, animals and Rakshasas.\n\n===Mahayana Buddhist literature===\nChapter 26 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the [[Lotus Sutra]].

Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.\n[[File:Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba.jpg|thumb|Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba]]\n\n* [[Ghatotkacha]], a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasa Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son's name refers to his round bald head; ''ghata'' means 'pot' and ''utkacha'' means 'head' in [[Sanskrit]]. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. His wife was [[Ahilawati]] and his son was [[Barbarika]].\n\nIn the ''Mahabharata,'' Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of [[Jayadratha]], when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King [[Bhagadatta]], and [[Ashwatthama|Aswatthaman]], the son of [[Drona]]), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero [[Karna]]. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader [[Duryodhana]] had appealed to his best fighter, [[Karna]], to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, [[Shakti]], granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy [[Arjuna]], the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor [[Krishna]] smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the ''Shakta'' divine weapon. A temple in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the [[Hidimba Devi Temple]].\n* [[Bakasura]] was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local [[Brahmin]] family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 159-166.)\n* [[Kirmira]], the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 11).\n* [[Jatasura]] was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], attempted to steal the Pandavas' weapons and to ravish [[Draupadi]], wife of [[Arjuna]]. Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156). Jatasur's son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the [[Kaurava]]s at [[Kurukshetra]].\n\n[[File:Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha.jpg|thumb|Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha]]\nRakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.\n\n* [[Alambusha]] was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the ''Mahabharata'', he fought on the side of the Kauravas. [[Arjuna]] defeated him in a duel (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 167), as did Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] (Book VI: Bhishma Parva, Section 101\u2013102). But Alamvusha in turn killed [[Iravan]], Arjuna's son by a [[N\u0101ga]] princess [[Ulupi]], when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of [[Garuda]]. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 107). He was slain by Bhima's son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 108).\n\n==In Buddhist lore==\n===Theravada Buddhist literature===\nIn the Maha Samaya Sutta, [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (also known as ''Namuci'' or the \"Dark One\") is the defeated antagonist of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He is described as a corrupted Asura, whose army consisted of \"Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others\" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.\n\nThe Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12) of the [[P\u0101li Canon]] recounts a story in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was harassed by a Rakshasa. The latter asked him to leave and then to return, over and over. When the Buddha refused to leave, the Rakshasa threatened to harm him if he could not answer his questions. The rest of the sutta concerns the question and answer dialogue. At the end, the rakshasa is convinced of the Buddha's holiness and becomes a follower.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn10/sn10.012.piya.html|title=Alavaka Sutta: Discourse to Alavaka|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=7 January 2020}}</ref> [[Sri Lanka]]n (Sinhala) ancestral legends refer to Yakshas as well.\n\nOne of Buddha's ten titles is \u201cPurisa Dama Sarati sata deva manusanam Buddho baghavati\u201d meaning the teacher of gods, men, animals and Rakshasas.\n\n===Mahayana Buddhist literature===\nChapter 26 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the [[Lotus Sutra]].

Where Lyn and Frigg had a strong identity with the [[academia]] and the upper classes, V\u00e5lerengen developed a [[working class]] identity.<ref name=vif2013 />\n\nV\u00e5lerengens Idrettsforening had mixed success in its first years, but fortunes improved as the 1920s came around and the club secured promotion to the Oslo Championships in 1921. V\u00e5lerengen won the Oslo Championships four times before a national league (Norgesserien) was established in 1937. In the [[1949 in Norwegian football|1948\u201349 season]], V\u00e5lerengen finished second.\n\nAfter this period, V\u00e5lerengen entered a period of instability, being relegated from the top division two times in the 1950s.\n\n===The Bohemians (1946\u201368)===\n[[File:LeifEriksen-NFDB.26102-604.jpg|thumb|[[Leif Eriksen]] was part of the group of players known as ''Bohemene''.]]\nThe charismatic Helmuth Steffens became a central figure in building up the culture in the club after the war. At the beginning of the 1960s, a new generation of local players broke into V\u00e5lerengen's first squad. Players like [[Einar Bruno Larsen]], [[Terje Hellerud]] and [[Leif Eriksen]] became core personalities of a group of players which eventually became known as ''Bohemene'' (''The Bohemians''). The club would become known for its brilliant style of football as the number of people in the audience increased. The players became popular for their charismatic, witty comments and light hearted humour. V\u00e5lerengen secured a third place in 1961.\n\nIn 1965, V\u00e5lerengen won the [[1. divisjon|First Division]] for the first time. By the help of manager Helmuth Steffens and head coach Anton Ploderer, the club had managed to win the title with a team of local players. The league was won in dramatic fashion, with arch-rivals [[FK Lyn|Lyn]] giving V\u00e5lerengen a fight for the title until the very last matches of the season.\n\nThe Bohemian era came to an end when the club was relegated from the First Division in 1968 and then again to the Third Division in 1970. V\u00e5lerengen did not achieve promotion to the top league again until 1974. In 1976, V\u00e5lerenga signed [[Odd Iversen]], who at the time had 112 First Division goals to his name. Iversen would help the club reestablish itself in the First Division.\n\n===The glory years (1977\u201386)===\nThe 80s saw the emergence of a new generation. With the help of players like [[Tom Jacobsen]] and [[Vidar Davidsen]], V\u00e5lerengen would win its first [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup title]] in 1980.\n\nLed by head coach [[Leif Eriksen]], the team won the First Division title for the second time in 1981 with a style of play characterized by intensity and discipline. The club was unable to reclaim the league title in 1982, but won it again in 1983 and 1984. During the decade, V\u00e5lerengen would also become twice runners-up in the cup and also achieve a third place in the league in 1985. V\u00e5lerengen had become a stable top team for the first and, to date, only time.\n\n1985 also saw the signing of striker [[J\u00f8rn Andersen]], who would go on to score 23 goals in 22 matches in his sole season for V\u00e5lerengen. However, as the club had miscalculated the home crowd average, the club entered severe financial difficulties. V\u00e5lerenga was saved from bankruptcy in 1987.\n\n===Ups and downs (1987\u20132003)===\nIn 1990, now known as V\u00e5lerenga, the club was relegated after 14 seasons in the top division. V\u00e5lerenga was close to further relegation in the 1992 season, but managed to remain in the [[1. divisjon|second highest division]] thanks to a last round 3\u20130 win against [[Eik-T\u00f8nsberg IF]]. In 1994, V\u00e5lerenga returned to the top division, but were relegated again in [[1996 Norwegian Premier League|1996]]. In 1997 V\u00e5lerenga won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup]] and the [[1. divisjon]] and were again promoted to [[Tippeligaen]]. As earlier in the 1990s, the stay in the top division lasted only a few years.\n\n[[File:Kjetil Rekdal 2006-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kjetil Rekdal]] joined V\u00e5lerenga in 2000 and became player-manager in 2001.]]\nIn the [[2000 Tippeligaen|2000 season]] V\u00e5lerenga lost the play-off matches against [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] and was relegated to the 1. divisjon. V\u00e5lerenga returned to [[Tippeligaen]] and won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup]] in 2002.\n\nThe [[2003 Tippeligaen|2003 season]] was poor for V\u00e5lerenga and they wound up third last in the league sending them into play-offs against [[Sandefjord Fotball|Sandefjord]] to avoid [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]]. The result was a 0\u20130 draw in Sandefjord and a 5\u20133 victory in [[Oslo]] and so V\u00e5lerenga retained the position in the top league and avoided relegation.\n\n===Success, disappointments and troubles (2004\u201312)===\nV\u00e5lerenga rebounded nicely in the [[2004 Tippeligaen|2004 season]] and proved a serious challenge to the dominant [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] team in the bid for the league's gold medal. After a frantic final round where V\u00e5lerenga beat [[Stab\u00e6k Fotball|Stab\u00e6k]] 3\u20130, they missed out on the league title since [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] beat [[FK Lyn]], V\u00e5lerenga's city rivals 4\u20131. V\u00e5lerenga won the silver medal, finishing 2nd to Rosenborg equal on points and goal difference, but V\u00e5lerenga had scored fewer goals than Rosenborg during the season, leaving Rosenborg as league champions.\n\nAt the start of the [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005 season]] it was apparent that Rosenborg was in bad shape and it seemed like V\u00e5lerenga's season to go all the way. After a strong season opening, the surprise of the season [[IK Start]] \u2013 newly promoted to the Tippeligaen \u2013 looked to give V\u00e5lerenga a fight to the finish, and the two clubs basically alternated on leading the series to the very last round. On 29 October it looked to be a thrilling last round reminiscent of the previous year, as both Start and V\u00e5lerenga had exactly the same number of points, but Start with a slightly better goal difference. Start met [[Fredrikstad FK]] at home, while V\u00e5lerenga met [[Odd Grenland]] away. Eventually Fredrikstad, who faced relegation if they lost, beat Start 3\u20131 while at the same time V\u00e5lerenga managed a 2\u20132 draw against Odd Grenland. V\u00e5lerenga stepped one up from the previous year, and won the title with a one-point margin. The title was V\u00e5lerenga's first league title in 21 years, ending Rosenborg's 13-year reign as league champions.\n\n[[File:Morten Berre 2006 06 06.jpg|thumb|[[Morten Berre]] holds the record for most matches in the highest division for V\u00e5lerenga.]]\nThe follow-up [[2006 Tippeligaen|season of 2006]] did not start out as well for the reigning champions, and a poor start left them at the bottom of the table after seven rounds, having gained only 5 points. A steady rise in form though still brought the team to 6th place by the time the season was half-through. Late July brought a string of bad results, including embarrassing losses to main rival [[FK Lyn]], and the exit from the [[UEFA Champions League]], after losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to Czech club [[FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav]] in the 2nd qualifying round. V\u00e5lerenga had aimed to qualify for the tournament after missing out the previous year by being defeated by Belgian side [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on a penalty shoot-out. After losing five out of seven games between 22 July and 19 August head-coach [[Kjetil Rekdal]] announced his resignation. Assistant coach [[Petter Myhre]] took over as interim manager, and as a result the club regained their form and scored 25 out of the last 30 possible points, bringing the club to a third place in the league, as well as a qualification spot for the 2007\u201308 [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. V\u00e5lerenga also qualified for play in the 2006\u201307 Scandinavian [[Royal League]] after finishing among the top four teams in Norway. In October 2006, Petter Myhre was hired on a permanent basis, but he would resign in July 2007, following a string of bad results.\n\nIn November 2007, [[Martin Andresen]] signed a three-year contract to become the next manager of V\u00e5lerenga. Heavy investment from owners and investors saw the signing of several high-profile players, most notably [[Lars Iver Strand]] and [[Kristoffer H\u00e6stad]]. However, despite winning the [[2008 Norwegian Football Cup]], the following season was a disappointment, with V\u00e5lerenga finishing 10th in the league. In the 2009 season, V\u00e5lerenga finished 7th, reaching the semifinal in the cup. 2010 saw a revitalized V\u00e5lerenga, led by a trio of effective forwards, [[Mohammed Abdellaoue]], [[Bengt S\u00e6ternes]] and [[Luton Shelton]]. V\u00e5lerenga finished second in the league.\n\nHowever, V\u00e5lerenga could not repeat the success in 2011 and 2012. In October 2012, Andresen and V\u00e5lerenga agreed to part ways.\n\n===A new era (2013\u2013present)===\nKjetil Rekdal returned to the club as head coach in January 2013. Facing economic difficulties from previous seasons and being without a shirt sponsorship deal, V\u00e5lerenga spent much of the 2014 season dealing with a severe risk of bankruptcy, finally signing a new shirt sponsorship deal with [[DNB ASA|DnB]] on 29 July.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.klanen.no/blog/2014/07/generalsponsor-er-i-boks/ |language=Norwegian |title=Generalsponsor er i boks! |publisher=Klanen.no |first=|last=|date=29 Jul 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The signing of striker Vidar \u00d6rn Kjartansson in front of 2014 season proved to be a huge success, with the Icelandic player scoring 25 goals in 29 games, helping the Oslo club secure a sixth place in the league after a drop in form in the latter half of the season.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, Ronny Deila was appointed as the new head coach. Deila was originally planned to take over in January 2017, but was involved in the coaching team for the final games of the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronny Deila har signert for V\u00e5lerenga!|url=http://www.vif-fotball.no/latest-news/article/ynfcqrudwiis165xbflg25gcs/title/ronny-deila-har-signert-for-valerenga|website=V\u00e5lerenga fotball|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref> Kjetil Rekdal was to become director of sports, but left the club in early 2017. In December 2019, Ronny Deila left to become the coach of New York City Football Club. In January 2020, [[Dag-Eilev Fagermo]] became the new head coach. \n\nV\u00e5lerenga moved into their newly built stadium, [[Intility Arena]], in September 2017. This was a historic move for the club, after spending 104 years without owning a home stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/na-flytter-vif-hjem-1.1008177 |language=Norwegian |title=N\u00e5 flytter VIF hjem |publisher=Dagsavisen.no |first=|last=|date=15 Aug 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> The new stadium is also close to V\u00e5lerenga neighborhood of Oslo.\n\n==Colours==\nUp to 1913, V\u00e5lerenga's kit was moss green. In 1914, the [[Norwegian State Railways]] had a set of blue and red kits left over, which V\u00e5lerenga bought cheaply, so their official colours became blue and red. The 2006 season away kit was white with a touch of moss green.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Intility Arena}}\n\nIn 2017, V\u00e5lerenga opened their own home ground at [[Valle Hovin]] in Eastern Oslo, called [[Intility Arena]]. The stadium has a capacity of 17,333 on domestic games (15,389 on international games), and the playing surface is [[artificial grass]]. The very first match in the ground saw the V\u00e5lerenga women's team beat [[Kolbotn Fotball]] 2-0 on September 9, 2017, with [[Stephanie Verdoia]] being the first ever goalscorer on the Arena. The next day, the men's team lost 2-1 to [[Sarpsborg 08]] in their first game at the stadium. The ground was first called [[V\u00e5lerenga kultur- og idrettspark]], before the club agreed a contract with the IT company [[Intility]] to rename the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vif-fotball.no/om-stadion/valerengas-nye-stadion-historien/ |language=Norwegian |title=Historien om Intility Arena |publisher=vif-fotball.no |date=27 Oct 2017 |accessdate=5 Feb 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The construction of the new arena===\nFollowing a press statement made on 15 May 2008, V\u00e5lerenga announced that they would be moving home to Valle Hovin after purchasing the area of the proposed stadium for the symbolic sum of 1 Norwegian Krone.

Bislett Stadium also hosted speed skating and track and field events in addition to football, and hosted the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. Poor conditions and maintenance of Bislett forced V\u00e5lerenga to move to [[Ullevaal Stadion|Ullevaal]] and a [[groundshare]] with [[FK Lyn]].\n\nAfter V\u00e5lerenga moved from [[Bislett Stadium]] plans for building their own ground were conceived, but poor results on the field combined with financial problems kept those plans at bay for a few years. After the second place in [[2004 Norwegian Premier League|2004]] and the league title in [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005]] as well as business man [[John Fredriksen]]'s deletion of the club's debt in 2003, the talks of building a ground for V\u00e5lerenga resurfaced.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[Image:Ullevaal Stadion Postbanken 2006-05-12.JPG|thumb|V\u00e5lerenga supporters in the stand nicknamed \"The West Bank\"]]\n\nV\u00e5lerenga has traditionally drawn support from the area around [[V\u00e5lerenga|V\u00e5lerenga, Oslo]] and various other places on the [[East End and West End of Oslo|east end of Oslo]], although today these lines are largely blurred and the club has supporters all over Oslo and the surrounding areas. Up until the early 90s, V\u00e5lerenga's supporters were loosely organised. The supporters were sometimes referred to as ''Apeberget'', but this is actually a misnomer from a journalist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vpn.no/leserbrev/2005/05/hvor-ble-humoristene-av/ |language=Norwegian |title=Hvor ble humoristene av? |publisher=VPN.no |first=|last=|date=|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> An independent supporter club called ''Klanen'' (\"The Clan\") was founded in 1991. It has around 10,000 members today. The senior team of V\u00e5lerenga has reserved shirt number 12 for their supporters. V\u00e5lerenga\u00b4s supporters, and specifically Klanen, are widely considered to be the best football supporters in Norway. \n\n===Rivalries===\nV\u00e5lerenga's main rivals include [[Lillestr\u00f8m SK|Lillestr\u00f8m]], [[Ham Kam]], [[Kongsvinger IL|Kongsvinger]], [[SK Brann|Brann]] and [[FK Lyn|Lyn]].

Founded in 1913, the club is named after the neighbourhood of [[V\u00e5lerenga]]. V\u00e5lerenga's home ground is [[Intility Arena]], located in [[Valle-Hovin]]. V\u00e5lerenga are five-time league champions and four-time [[Norwegian Football Cup]] champions, having last won the league in [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005]] and the cup in [[2008 Norwegian Football Cup|2008]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ved Sota-hj\u00f8rnet p\u00e5 V\u00e5lerenga OB.\u00d846 0067.jpg|thumb|left|VIF players at Sotahj\u00f8rnet in 1946.]]\n\n===Early days (1913\u201345)===\nThe history of V\u00e5lerenga Fotball goes back to ''Fotballpartiet Spark'', which was founded in 1898 by pastor [[Hans M\u00f8ller Gasmann]]. An early mission for Gasmann was to give the local youth social activity and exercise. On a larger scale, the club was part of the movement known as [[Muscular Christianity]].<ref name=vif2013>{{cite book |last=Olstad |first=Finn |date=2012 |title=Heia V\u00e5lerenga! |trans-title= |url= |language=Norwegian |location= |publisher=Aschehoug |isbn=978-82-03-39021-0}}</ref> A successor to this football club, ''Idrettslaget Spring'', was founded on 29 July 1913 by a group of teenage factory workers. A year later, the club changed its name to ''Vaalerengens Idr\u00e6ttsforening''. Rooted in the neighborhood of V\u00e5lerenga on the east end of Oslo, the club would recruit players and supporters from the many workers in the area, in a society then characterized for its low mobility between social strata. Within its first seasons, V\u00e5lerengen would compete with the major clubs in Oslo at that time; [[FK Lyn|Lyn]], [[Mercantile Ski- og Fotballklubb|Mercantile]] and [[Frigg Oslo FK|Frigg]]. Where Lyn and Frigg had a strong identity with the [[academia]] and the upper classes, V\u00e5lerengen developed a [[working class]] identity.<ref name=vif2013 />\n\nV\u00e5lerengens Idrettsforening had mixed success in its first years, but fortunes improved as the 1920s came around and the club secured promotion to the Oslo Championships in 1921. V\u00e5lerengen won the Oslo Championships four times before a national league (Norgesserien) was established in 1937. In the [[1949 in Norwegian football|1948\u201349 season]], V\u00e5lerengen finished second.\n\nAfter this period, V\u00e5lerengen entered a period of instability, being relegated from the top division two times in the 1950s.\n\n===The Bohemians (1946\u201368)===\n[[File:LeifEriksen-NFDB.26102-604.jpg|thumb|[[Leif Eriksen]] was part of the group of players known as ''Bohemene''.]]\nThe charismatic Helmuth Steffens became a central figure in building up the culture in the club after the war. At the beginning of the 1960s, a new generation of local players broke into V\u00e5lerengen's first squad. Players like [[Einar Bruno Larsen]], [[Terje Hellerud]] and [[Leif Eriksen]] became core personalities of a group of players which eventually became known as ''Bohemene'' (''The Bohemians''). The club would become known for its brilliant style of football as the number of people in the audience increased. The players became popular for their charismatic, witty comments and light hearted humour. V\u00e5lerengen secured a third place in 1961.\n\nIn 1965, V\u00e5lerengen won the [[1. divisjon|First Division]] for the first time. By the help of manager Helmuth Steffens and head coach Anton Ploderer, the club had managed to win the title with a team of local players. The league was won in dramatic fashion, with arch-rivals [[FK Lyn|Lyn]] giving V\u00e5lerengen a fight for the title until the very last matches of the season.\n\nThe Bohemian era came to an end when the club was relegated from the First Division in 1968 and then again to the Third Division in 1970. V\u00e5lerengen did not achieve promotion to the top league again until 1974. In 1976, V\u00e5lerenga signed [[Odd Iversen]], who at the time had 112 First Division goals to his name. Iversen would help the club reestablish itself in the First Division.\n\n===The glory years (1977\u201386)===\nThe 80s saw the emergence of a new generation. With the help of players like [[Tom Jacobsen]] and [[Vidar Davidsen]], V\u00e5lerengen would win its first [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup title]] in 1980.\n\nLed by head coach [[Leif Eriksen]], the team won the First Division title for the second time in 1981 with a style of play characterized by intensity and discipline. The club was unable to reclaim the league title in 1982, but won it again in 1983 and 1984. During the decade, V\u00e5lerengen would also become twice runners-up in the cup and also achieve a third place in the league in 1985. V\u00e5lerengen had become a stable top team for the first and, to date, only time.\n\n1985 also saw the signing of striker [[J\u00f8rn Andersen]], who would go on to score 23 goals in 22 matches in his sole season for V\u00e5lerengen. However, as the club had miscalculated the home crowd average, the club entered severe financial difficulties. V\u00e5lerenga was saved from bankruptcy in 1987.\n\n===Ups and downs (1987\u20132003)===\nIn 1990, now known as V\u00e5lerenga, the club was relegated after 14 seasons in the top division. V\u00e5lerenga was close to further relegation in the 1992 season, but managed to remain in the [[1. divisjon|second highest division]] thanks to a last round 3\u20130 win against [[Eik-T\u00f8nsberg IF]]. In 1994, V\u00e5lerenga returned to the top division, but were relegated again in [[1996 Norwegian Premier League|1996]]. In 1997 V\u00e5lerenga won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup]] and the [[1. divisjon]] and were again promoted to [[Tippeligaen]]. As earlier in the 1990s, the stay in the top division lasted only a few years.\n\n[[File:Kjetil Rekdal 2006-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kjetil Rekdal]] joined V\u00e5lerenga in 2000 and became player-manager in 2001.]]\nIn the [[2000 Tippeligaen|2000 season]] V\u00e5lerenga lost the play-off matches against [[Sogndal Fotball|Sogndal]] and was relegated to the 1. divisjon. V\u00e5lerenga returned to [[Tippeligaen]] and won the [[Norwegian Football Cup|cup]] in 2002.\n\nThe [[2003 Tippeligaen|2003 season]] was poor for V\u00e5lerenga and they wound up third last in the league sending them into play-offs against [[Sandefjord Fotball|Sandefjord]] to avoid [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]]. The result was a 0\u20130 draw in Sandefjord and a 5\u20133 victory in [[Oslo]] and so V\u00e5lerenga retained the position in the top league and avoided relegation.\n\n===Success, disappointments and troubles (2004\u201312)===\nV\u00e5lerenga rebounded nicely in the [[2004 Tippeligaen|2004 season]] and proved a serious challenge to the dominant [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] team in the bid for the league's gold medal. After a frantic final round where V\u00e5lerenga beat [[Stab\u00e6k Fotball|Stab\u00e6k]] 3\u20130, they missed out on the league title since [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] beat [[FK Lyn]], V\u00e5lerenga's city rivals 4\u20131. V\u00e5lerenga won the silver medal, finishing 2nd to Rosenborg equal on points and goal difference, but V\u00e5lerenga had scored fewer goals than Rosenborg during the season, leaving Rosenborg as league champions.\n\nAt the start of the [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005 season]] it was apparent that Rosenborg was in bad shape and it seemed like V\u00e5lerenga's season to go all the way. After a strong season opening, the surprise of the season [[IK Start]] \u2013 newly promoted to the Tippeligaen \u2013 looked to give V\u00e5lerenga a fight to the finish, and the two clubs basically alternated on leading the series to the very last round. On 29 October it looked to be a thrilling last round reminiscent of the previous year, as both Start and V\u00e5lerenga had exactly the same number of points, but Start with a slightly better goal difference. Start met [[Fredrikstad FK]] at home, while V\u00e5lerenga met [[Odd Grenland]] away. Eventually Fredrikstad, who faced relegation if they lost, beat Start 3\u20131 while at the same time V\u00e5lerenga managed a 2\u20132 draw against Odd Grenland. V\u00e5lerenga stepped one up from the previous year, and won the title with a one-point margin. The title was V\u00e5lerenga's first league title in 21 years, ending Rosenborg's 13-year reign as league champions.\n\n[[File:Morten Berre 2006 06 06.jpg|thumb|[[Morten Berre]] holds the record for most matches in the highest division for V\u00e5lerenga.]]\nThe follow-up [[2006 Tippeligaen|season of 2006]] did not start out as well for the reigning champions, and a poor start left them at the bottom of the table after seven rounds, having gained only 5 points. A steady rise in form though still brought the team to 6th place by the time the season was half-through. Late July brought a string of bad results, including embarrassing losses to main rival [[FK Lyn]], and the exit from the [[UEFA Champions League]], after losing 5\u20133 on aggregate to Czech club [[FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav]] in the 2nd qualifying round. V\u00e5lerenga had aimed to qualify for the tournament after missing out the previous year by being defeated by Belgian side [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] on a penalty shoot-out. After losing five out of seven games between 22 July and 19 August head-coach [[Kjetil Rekdal]] announced his resignation. Assistant coach [[Petter Myhre]] took over as interim manager, and as a result the club regained their form and scored 25 out of the last 30 possible points, bringing the club to a third place in the league, as well as a qualification spot for the 2007\u201308 [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. V\u00e5lerenga also qualified for play in the 2006\u201307 Scandinavian [[Royal League]] after finishing among the top four teams in Norway. In October 2006, Petter Myhre was hired on a permanent basis, but he would resign in July 2007, following a string of bad results.\n\nIn November 2007, [[Martin Andresen]] signed a three-year contract to become the next manager of V\u00e5lerenga. Heavy investment from owners and investors saw the signing of several high-profile players, most notably [[Lars Iver Strand]] and [[Kristoffer H\u00e6stad]]. However, despite winning the [[2008 Norwegian Football Cup]], the following season was a disappointment, with V\u00e5lerenga finishing 10th in the league. In the 2009 season, V\u00e5lerenga finished 7th, reaching the semifinal in the cup. 2010 saw a revitalized V\u00e5lerenga, led by a trio of effective forwards, [[Mohammed Abdellaoue]], [[Bengt S\u00e6ternes]] and [[Luton Shelton]]. V\u00e5lerenga finished second in the league.\n\nHowever, V\u00e5lerenga could not repeat the success in 2011 and 2012. In October 2012, Andresen and V\u00e5lerenga agreed to part ways.\n\n===A new era (2013\u2013present)===\nKjetil Rekdal returned to the club as head coach in January 2013. Facing economic difficulties from previous seasons and being without a shirt sponsorship deal, V\u00e5lerenga spent much of the 2014 season dealing with a severe risk of bankruptcy, finally signing a new shirt sponsorship deal with [[DNB ASA|DnB]] on 29 July.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.klanen.no/blog/2014/07/generalsponsor-er-i-boks/ |language=Norwegian |title=Generalsponsor er i boks! |publisher=Klanen.no |first=|last=|date=29 Jul 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The signing of striker Vidar \u00d6rn Kjartansson in front of 2014 season proved to be a huge success, with the Icelandic player scoring 25 goals in 29 games, helping the Oslo club secure a sixth place in the league after a drop in form in the latter half of the season.\n\nOn 13 July 2016, Ronny Deila was appointed as the new head coach. Deila was originally planned to take over in January 2017, but was involved in the coaching team for the final games of the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronny Deila har signert for V\u00e5lerenga!|url=http://www.vif-fotball.no/latest-news/article/ynfcqrudwiis165xbflg25gcs/title/ronny-deila-har-signert-for-valerenga|website=V\u00e5lerenga fotball|accessdate=6 October 2016}}</ref> Kjetil Rekdal was to become director of sports, but left the club in early 2017. In December 2019, Ronny Deila left to become the coach of New York City Football Club. In January 2020, [[Dag-Eilev Fagermo]] became the new head coach. \n\nV\u00e5lerenga moved into their newly built stadium, [[Intility Arena]], in September 2017. This was a historic move for the club, after spending 104 years without owning a home stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dagsavisen.no/oslo/na-flytter-vif-hjem-1.1008177 |language=Norwegian |title=N\u00e5 flytter VIF hjem |publisher=Dagsavisen.no |first=|last=|date=15 Aug 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> The new stadium is also close to V\u00e5lerenga neighborhood of Oslo.\n\n==Colours==\nUp to 1913, V\u00e5lerenga's kit was moss green. In 1914, the [[Norwegian State Railways]] had a set of blue and red kits left over, which V\u00e5lerenga bought cheaply, so their official colours became blue and red. The 2006 season away kit was white with a touch of moss green.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Intility Arena}}\n\nIn 2017, V\u00e5lerenga opened their own home ground at [[Valle Hovin]] in Eastern Oslo, called [[Intility Arena]]. The stadium has a capacity of 17,333 on domestic games (15,389 on international games), and the playing surface is [[artificial grass]]. The very first match in the ground saw the V\u00e5lerenga women's team beat [[Kolbotn Fotball]] 2-0 on September 9, 2017, with [[Stephanie Verdoia]] being the first ever goalscorer on the Arena. The next day, the men's team lost 2-1 to [[Sarpsborg 08]] in their first game at the stadium. The ground was first called [[V\u00e5lerenga kultur- og idrettspark]], before the club agreed a contract with the IT company [[Intility]] to rename the stadium.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vif-fotball.no/om-stadion/valerengas-nye-stadion-historien/ |language=Norwegian |title=Historien om Intility Arena |publisher=vif-fotball.no |date=27 Oct 2017 |accessdate=5 Feb 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The construction of the new arena===\nFollowing a press statement made on 15 May 2008, V\u00e5lerenga announced that they would be moving home to Valle Hovin after purchasing the area of the proposed stadium for the symbolic sum of 1 Norwegian Krone.

Bislett Stadium also hosted speed skating and track and field events in addition to football, and hosted the [[1952 Winter Olympics]]. Poor conditions and maintenance of Bislett forced V\u00e5lerenga to move to [[Ullevaal Stadion|Ullevaal]] and a [[groundshare]] with [[FK Lyn]].\n\nAfter V\u00e5lerenga moved from [[Bislett Stadium]] plans for building their own ground were conceived, but poor results on the field combined with financial problems kept those plans at bay for a few years. After the second place in [[2004 Norwegian Premier League|2004]] and the league title in [[2005 Tippeligaen|2005]] as well as business man [[John Fredriksen]]'s deletion of the club's debt in 2003, the talks of building a ground for V\u00e5lerenga resurfaced.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[Image:Ullevaal Stadion Postbanken 2006-05-12.JPG|thumb|V\u00e5lerenga supporters in the stand nicknamed \"The West Bank\"]]\n\nV\u00e5lerenga has traditionally drawn support from the area around [[V\u00e5lerenga|V\u00e5lerenga, Oslo]] and various other places on the [[East End and West End of Oslo|east end of Oslo]], although today these lines are largely blurred and the club has supporters all over Oslo and the surrounding areas. Up until the early 90s, V\u00e5lerenga's supporters were loosely organised. The supporters were sometimes referred to as ''Apeberget'', but this is actually a misnomer from a journalist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vpn.no/leserbrev/2005/05/hvor-ble-humoristene-av/ |language=Norwegian |title=Hvor ble humoristene av? |publisher=VPN.no |first=|last=|date=|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> An independent supporter club called ''Klanen'' (\"The Clan\") was founded in 1991. It has around 10,000 members today. The senior team of V\u00e5lerenga has reserved shirt number 12 for their supporters. V\u00e5lerenga\u00b4s supporters, and specifically Klanen, are widely considered to be the best football supporters in Norway. \n\n===Rivalries===\nV\u00e5lerenga's main rivals include [[Lillestr\u00f8m SK|Lillestr\u00f8m]], [[Ham Kam]], [[Kongsvinger IL|Kongsvinger]], [[SK Brann|Brann]] and [[FK Lyn|Lyn]].
