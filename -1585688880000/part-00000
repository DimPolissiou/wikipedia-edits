avoid mirrors, repetitively change outfits, groom excessively, or restrict eating.<ref name=Phillips-2004/>\n\nBDD's severity can wax and wane, and flareups tend to yield absences from school, work,

It is mainly found in [[Africa]]. The parasite is transmitted through the bite of [[Fly|small flies]]. Studies show that there are elevated levels of [[white blood cells]].\n\nAcanthocheilonemiasis belongs to a group of parasitic diseases known as filarial disease ([[nematode]]), all of which are classified as [[Neglected Tropical Diseases]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webhealthnetwork.com/disease/9-2651/acanthocheilonemiasis-perstans|title=Acanthocheilonemiasis Perstans - Diseases & Condition - Web Health Network|website=www.webhealthnetwork.com|access-date=2016-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Simonsen|first=Paul E.|last2=Onapa|first2=Ambrose W.|last3=Asio|first3=Santa Maria|date=2011-09-01|title=Mansonella perstans filariasis in Africa|url=|journal=Acta Tropica|series=The Diagnostics and Control of Neglected Tropical Helminth Diseases|volume=120, Supplement 1|pages=S109\u2013S120|doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2010.01.014|pmid=20152790}}</ref> Filarial disease results when microfilariae, which are nematode larvae, reach the [[lymphatic system]]; microfilariae reside in the serous cavities of humans. They have a five-stage life cycle that includes birth to thousands of live microfilariae within the host (i.e. human body), and then translocation via blood meal to the dermis layer of the skin. It is here that microfilariae cause major symptoms, which are edema and thickening of the skin and underlying connective tissues. It can also cause [[skin rashes]], [[Abdominal pain|abdominal]] and [[chest pain]]s, [[Muscle pain|muscle]] (myalgia) and [[joint pain]]s, [[neurological disorders]] and skin lumps. In addition, it causes spleen and liver enlargement, which is called [[hepatosplenomegaly]]. Studies show elevated levels of leukocytes, or white blood cells, which is referred to as [[eosinophilia]]. It is mainly found in [[Africa]].

However, if symptoms do arise, it is typically in individuals who are visiting highly infected areas rather than natives to those areas. A major common laboratory finding is an increase in specialized white blood cells, which is called eosinophilia.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOther symptoms include itchy skin, neurological symptoms, abdominal and chest pain, muscle pain, and swelling underneath the skin. If there are abnormally high levels of [[white blood cells]], then a [[physical examination]] will most likely find an enlarged spleen or liver.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn certain scenarios, nematodes may physically lodge into the chest or abdomen, resulting in an inflammation. Diagnosis of this condition usually occurs via a blood smear examination under light microscopy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nAbsolute [[eosinophilia]] in immigrants that is correlated with parasitic diseases that may go undiagnosed. Absolute eosinophilia is clinically diagnosed as >0.45\u00d710<sup>9</sup> eosinophilic leucocytes/L of peripheral blood.<ref name=\":5\" /> Recent studies suggest that around 60% of children with relative eosinophilia contracted this via parasitic infections.

In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with a short white supercilium and warmer brown rump. There are rufous fringes on the closed wings and white edged to the tail. Underparts are whitish-buff.  The sexes are identical except that the male has a blacker bill and mouth in the breeding season.\n\nIn winter, the upperparts are a warmer brown, and the underparts more buff. The tail is longer than in summer. There are a four races differing in plumage shade.  The distinctive [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] race in [[Sri Lanka]], '' P. s.valida'', retains summer plumage, including the shorter tail, all year round, and lacks the supercilium and white in the tail.\n\n==Behaviour==\nLike most warblers, the prinia is insectivorous.  It builds its nest in a shrub or tall grass and lays 3-5 eggs.  The song is a repetitive ''pit-pretty, pit-pretty, pit-pretty''.\n[[File:JPrinia TRSR rec026.ogg|thumb|Song of Jungle Prinia in Tamil Nadu, India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* ''Warblers of Europe, Asia and North Africa'' by Baker, {{ISBN|0-7136-3971-7}}\n* ''Birds of India'' by Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp, {{ISBN|0-691-04910-6}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2226845}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:prinia, jungle}}\n[[Category:Prinia|jungle prinia]]\n[[Category:Birds of India]]\n[[Category:Birds of Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1840|jungle prinia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Speciesbox\n|name=Jungle prinia\n|image=Aravalli BiodivPark Gurgaon DSC9002 v1 (cropped).JPG\n|image_caption=In [[Aravali Biodiversity Park, Gurgaon]]\n|status=LC\n|status_system=IUCN3.1\n|status_ref=<ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22713595/0 |title=''Prinia sylvatica'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n|genus=Prinia\n|species=sylvatica\n|authority=([[Thomas C.
