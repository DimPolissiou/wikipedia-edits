Despite the name, unlike [[wine]], in which [[Ethanol|alcohol]] is produced by [[Fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] sugar that is naturally present in fruit (typically grapes), sake is produced by a [[brewing]] process more akin to that of [[beer]], where [[starch]] is converted into sugars, which ferment into alcohol.\n\nThe brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer(Alexey Topol M), where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other [[rice wine]]s, when ''sake'' is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3\u20139% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], wine generally contains 9\u201316% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/10 10]}}</ref> and undiluted sake contains 18\u201320% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water prior to bottling).\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the word ''sake'' ([[kanji]]: [[wikt:\u9152#Japanese|\u9152]], {{IPA-ja|sake}}) can refer to any [[alcoholic drink]], while the beverage called \"sake\" in English is usually termed '''''nihonshu''''' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152}}; meaning 'Japanese liquor'). Under Japanese [[liquor laws]], sake is labelled with the word \"'''''seishu'''''\" ({{lang|ja|\u6e05\u9152}}; 'clear liquor'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation.\n\nIn Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special [[ceremony]], where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or [[porcelain]] bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a ''[[Sake set#Drinking cups|sakazuki]]''. As with wine, the recommended ''serving temperature'' of sake varies greatly by type.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of sake is unclear. The earliest reference to the use of alcohol in Japan is recorded in the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' in the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]''.

The ''[[Tamon-in Diary]]'', written by abbots of [[Tamon-in]] (temple) from 1478 to 1618, records many details of brewing in the temple. The diary shows that pasteurization and the process of adding ingredients to the main fermentation mash in three stages were established practices by that time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the 16th century, the technique of distillation was introduced into the Kyushu district from Ryukyu.<ref name=\":0\" /> The brewing of [[sh\u014dch\u016b]], called \"Imo\u2014sake\" started, and was sold at the central market in [[Kyoto]].\n\n[[File:Bereiding van sak\u00e9 1781.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of ''Bereiding van Sacki'', by [[Isaac Titsingh]]: earliest explanation of the sake brewing process in a European language.

Around 30,000 breweries sprang up around the country within a year. However, as the years went by, the government levied more and more taxes on the sake industry and slowly the number of breweries dwindled to 8,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nMost of the breweries that grew and survived this period were set up by wealthy landowners. Landowners who grew rice crops would have rice left over at the end of the season and, rather than letting these leftovers go to waste, would ship it to their breweries. The most successful of these family breweries still operate today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nDuring the 20th century, sake-brewing technology grew by leaps and bounds. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the very first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. Yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and being devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered wooden barrels to be unhygienic because of the potential bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using wooden barrels means that a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (somewhere around 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This was the end of the wooden-barrel age of sake and the use of wooden barrels in brewing was completely eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn Japan, sake has long been taxed by the national government. In 1898, this tax brought in about [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]5&nbsp;million out of a total of about \u00a5120&nbsp;million, about 4.6% of the government's total direct tax income.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Casal |first=U. A. |year=1939 |title=Some notes on the Sakazuki and the Role of Drinking Sake in Japan |journal=[[Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan]] |page=73}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905, the government banned the home brewing of sake. At the time, sake still made up an astonishing 30% of Japan's tax revenue. Since home-brewed sake is tax-free sake, the logic was that by banning the home brewing of sake, sales would go up, and more tax money would be collected. This was the end of home-brewed sake, and the law remains in effect today even though sake sales now make up only 2% of government income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nWhen [[World War II]] brought rice shortages, the sake-brewing industry was dealt a hefty blow as the government clamped down on the use of rice for brewing. As early as the late 17th century, it had been discovered that small amounts of alcohol could be added to sake before pressing to extract aromas and flavors from the rice solids, but during the war, pure alcohol and [[glucose]] were added to small quantities of rice mash, increasing the yield by as much as four times. 75% of today's sake is made using this technique, left over from the war years. There were even a few breweries producing \"sake\" that contained no rice at all. Naturally, the quality of sake during this time varied greatly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter the war, breweries slowly began to recover, and the quality of sake gradually went up. However, new players on the scene\u2014beer, wine, and spirits\u2014became very popular in Japan, and in the 1960s beer consumption surpassed sake for the first time. Sake consumption continued to go down while, in contrast, the quality of sake steadily improved.\n\nToday, sake has become a world beverage with a few breweries springing up in China, Southeast Asia, South America, North America, and Australia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2019/05/04/food/american-based-breweries-creating-brand-sake/|title=American-based breweries are creating their own brand of sake|last=Hirano|first=Ko|date=2019-05-04|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2019-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref> More breweries are also turning to older methods of production.\n\nWhile the rest of the world may be drinking more sake and the quality of sake has been increasing, sake production in Japan has been declining since the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gauntner|first= John |year=2002 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=5y7X-mfWCEIC&printsec=frontcover#PPA78,M1 |title=The Sake Handbook| page= 78|isbn= 9780804834254 }}</ref> The number of sake breweries is also declining.

Unrefined sake was squeezed out at the brewery and there are about 180 holes (60 cm  wide, 20 cm deep) for holding storage jars. A hollow (1.8 meter wide, 1 meter deep) for a pot to collect drops of pressed sake and 14th-century [[Bizen ware]] jars were also found. It is estimated to be utilized until the [[Onin War]] (1467-1477). Sake was brewed at [[Tenry\u016b-ji]] during the [[Muromachi Period]] (1336-1573).<ref>{{cite web |title=Oldest sake brewery found at former temple site in Kyoto |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ202001190005.html |publisher= The Asahi Shimbun |access-date=January 20, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brasserie de sak\u00e9 Takayama.jpg|thumb|Sake brewery, [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]], with a ''sugitama'' (\u6749\u7389) globe of cedar leaves indicating sake.]]\n\n===Rice===\nThe rice used for brewing sake is called ''saka mai'' {{lang|ja|\u9152\u7c73}} (sake rice), or officially ''shuz\u014d k\u014dtekimai'' {{lang|ja|\u9152\u9020\u597d\u9069\u7c73}} (sake-brewing suitable rice). There are at least 80 types of sake rice in Japan.\nAmong these, [[Yamada Nishiki|Yamadanishiki]], Gohyakumangoku, Miyamanishiki and Omachi rice are very popular.\nThe grain is larger, stronger (If a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing), and contains less protein and lipid than the ordinary rice eaten by the Japanese.\nSake rice is used only for making sake, because it is unpalatable for eating.\n\nSake rice is usually polished to a much higher degree than rice that is used for eating.\nThe reason for polishing is a result of the composition and structure of the rice grain itself.\nThe core of the rice grain is rich in starch, while the outer layers of the grain contain higher concentrations of fats, vitamins and proteins.\nSince higher concentration of fat and protein in the sake would lead to off-flavors and contribute rough elements to the sake, the outer layers of the sake rice grain is milled away in a polishing process, leaving only the starchy part of the grain (some sake brewers remove over 60% of the rice grain in the polishing process).\nThat desirable pocket of starch in the center of the grain is called the shinpaku (\u5fc3\u767d).\nIt usually takes 2 to 3 days to polish rice down to less than half its original size. The rice powder that is a by-product of the polishing is very often used for making [[rice crackers]], or Japanese sweets (i.e. [[Dango]]), and other food stuffs.\n\nIf the sake is made with rice that has a higher percentage of its husk and outer portion of the core milled off, then more rice will be required to make that particular sake, and it will take longer to make. As a result, sake made with rice that has been highly milled (much of the rice has been polished off) is usually more expensive than a sake that has been made using less polished rice. However, this does not always mean that sake made by highly milled rice is of better quality than sake made by rice that has been milled less.\n\n'''Rice polishing ratio''', called ''Seimai-buai'' {{lang|ja|\u7cbe\u7c73\u6b69\u5408}} (see [[Glossary of sake terms]]) measures the degree of rice polishing. For example, rice polishing ratio of 60% means that the 60% of the original rice grain remains and the 40% has been polished away.\n\n===Water===\nWater is one of the important ingredients for making sake.  It is involved in almost every major process of sake brewing from washing the rice to dilution of the final product before bottling.  The mineral content of the water can play a large role in the final product.  [[Iron]] will bond with an [[amino acid]] produced by the k\u014dji to produce off flavors and a yellowish color.  [[Manganese]], when exposed to ultraviolet light, will also contribute to discoloration.  Conversely [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[phosphoric acid]] serve as nutrients for yeast during fermentation and are considered desirable.<ref name=water>{{cite web|last=Gauntner|first=John|title=How Sake Is Made|url=http://sake-world.com/about-sake/how-sake-is-made/the-water/|publisher=Sake World|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref>  The yeast will use those nutrients to work faster and multiply resulting in more sugar being converted into alcohol. While soft water will typically yield sweeter sake, hard water with a higher nutrient content is known for producing [[Dryness (taste)|drier-style]] sake.\n\nThe first region known for having great water was the [[Nada-Gog\u014d]] in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]].  A particular water source called \"Miyamizu\" was found to produce high quality sake and attract many producers to the region.  To this day Hy\u014dgo has the most sake brewers of any prefecture.<ref name=water />\n\nTypically breweries source their water from wells, though lakes and rivers can be used as well.  Also breweries may use tap water and filter and adjust components as they see fit.<ref name=water />\n\n=== K\u014dji-kin ===\n''K\u014dji-kin'' (''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'') spores are another important component of sake.

the conversion of starch into glucose followed by immediate conversion into alcohol.<ref name=\":5\" /> This process distinguishes sake from other [[liquor]]s like beer because it occurs in a single vat, whereas with beer, for instance, starch to glucose conversion and glucose to alcohol conversion occur in separate vats.<ref name=\":5\" /> The breakdown of starch into glucose is caused by the k\u014dji-kin fungus, while the conversion of glucose into alcohol is caused by yeast.<ref name=\":5\" /> Due to the yeast being available as soon as the glucose is produced, the conversion of glucose to alcohol is very efficient in sake brewing.<ref name=\":5\" /> This results in sake having a generally higher alcohol content than other types of liquor.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite

Nine to twelve months are required for sake to mature. Maturation is caused by physical and chemical factors such as oxygen supply, the broad application of external heat, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes and amino acids, among other unknown factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=National Research Institute of Brewing|date=March 2017|title=Sake Brewing: The Integration of Science and Technology|url=http://www.nrib.go.jp/English/sake/pdf/SakeNo02_en.pdf|journal=The Story of Sake|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===T\u014dji===\n{{nihongo|T\u014dji|\u675c\u6c0f}} is the job title of the sake [[brewer]], named after [[Du Kang]]. It is a highly respected job in the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], with t\u014dji being regarded like [[Japanese music|musicians]] or [[Japanese painting|painters]]. The title of t\u014dji was historically passed on from father to son; today new t\u014dji are either veteran brewery workers or are trained at universities. While modern breweries with refrigeration and cooling tanks operate year-round, most old-fashioned sake breweries are seasonal, operating only in the cool winter months. During the summer and fall most t\u014dji work elsewhere, and are commonly found on farms, only periodically returning to the brewery to supervise storage conditions or bottling operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esake.com/Knowledge/Ingredients/People/people.html|title=The People|publisher=eSake}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Varieties==\n\n===Special-designation sake===\nThere are two basic types of sake: {{nihongo||\u666e\u901a\u9152|'''Futs\u016b-shu'''|ordinary sake}} and {{nihongo||\u7279\u5b9a\u540d\u79f0\u9152|'''Tokutei meish\u014d-shu'''|special-designation sake}}. ''Futs\u016b-shu'' is the equivalent of [[table wine]] and accounts for the majority of sake produced. ''Tokutei meish\u014d-shu'' refers to premium sake distinguished by the degree to which the rice has been polished and the added percentage of brewer's alcohol or the absence of such additives. There are eight varieties of special-designation sake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/hyoji/seishu/gaiyo/02.htm\n|title=<span lang=\"ja\">\u300c\u6e05\u9152\u306e\u88fd\u6cd5\u54c1\u8cea\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u6e96\u300d\u306e\u6982\u8981</span>\n|trans-title=Summary of Sake brewing quality labeling standard |publisher=National Tax Agency Japan|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nThe four main grades of sake are ''junmai'', ''honjozo'', ''ginjo'' and ''daiginjo''.

This method was the standard for 300 years, but it is rare today.\n* '''Yamahai''' ({{lang|ja|\u5c71\u5ec3}}) is a simplified version of the kimoto method, introduced in the early 1900s. Yamahai skips the step of making a paste out of the starter mash. That step of the kimoto method is known as yama-oroshi, and the full name for yamahai is \u201cyama-oroshi haishi\u201d ({{lang|ja|\u5c71\u5378\u5ec3\u6b62}}), meaning \u201cdiscontinuation of yama-oroshi.\u201d While the yamahai method was originally developed to speed production time, it is slower than the modern method and is now used only in specialty brews for the earthy flavors it produces.\n* '''Sokuj\u014d''' ({{lang|ja|\u901f\u91b8}}), \"quick fermentation\", is the modern method of preparing the starter mash. Lactic acid, produced naturally in the two slower traditional methods, is added to the starter to inhibit unwanted bacteria. Sokuj\u014d sake tends to have a lighter flavor than kimoto or yamahai.\n\n===Different handling after fermentation===\n[[File:Unfiltered Sake at Gyu-Kaku.jpg|thumb|[[Nigori]], or unfiltered sake]]\n* '''Namazake''' ({{lang|ja|\u751f\u9152}}) is sake that has not been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]]. It requires refrigerated storage and has a shorter shelf-life than pasteurized sake.\n* '''Genshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u539f\u9152}}) is undiluted sake. Most sake is diluted with water after brewing to lower the alcohol content from 18\u201320% down to 14\u201316%, but genshu is not.\n* '''Muroka''' ({{lang|ja|\u7121\u6ffe\u904e}}) means unfiltered. It refers to sake that has not been carbon filtered, but which ''has'' been pressed and separated from the lees, and thus is clear, not cloudy.  Carbon filtration can remove desirable flavors and odors as well as bad ones, thus muroka sake has stronger flavors than filtered varieties.\n* '''[[Nigori]]zake''' ({{lang|ja|\u6fc1\u308a\u9152}}) is cloudy sake. The sake is passed through a loose mesh to separate it from the mash.  It is not filtered thereafter and there is much rice sediment in the bottle. Before serving, the bottle is shaken to mix the sediment and turn the sake white or cloudy.\n* '''Seishu''' ({{lang|ja|\u6e05\u9152}}), \"clear/clean sake\", is the Japanese legal definition of sake and refers to sake in which the solids have been strained out, leaving clear liquid.  Thus nigorizake and ''doburoku'' (see below) are not seishu and therefore are not actually sake under Japanese law. However, nigorizake can receive the seishu status by being strained clear and having the lees put back in afterward.\n* '''Koshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u53e4\u9152}}) is \"aged sake\". Most sake does not age well, but this specially made type can age for decades, turning yellow and acquiring a honeyed flavor.\n* '''Taruzake''' ({{lang|ja|\u6a3d\u9152}}) is sake aged in wooden barrels or bottled in wooden casks. The wood used is ''[[Cryptomeria]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u6749}}, ''sugi''), which is also known as Japanese cedar. Sake casks are often tapped ceremonially for the opening of buildings, businesses, parties, etc. Because the wood imparts a strong flavor, premium sake is rarely used for this type.\n* '''Shiboritate''' ({{lang|ja|\u643e\u7acb\u3066}}), \"freshly pressed\", refers to sake that has been shipped without the traditional six-month aging/maturation period.  The result is usually a more acidic, \"greener\" sake.\n* '''Fukurozuri''' ({{lang|ja|\u888b\u540a\u308a}}) is a method of separating sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under its own weight. Sake produced this way is sometimes called ''shizukuzake'' ({{lang|ja|\u96eb\u9152}}), meaning \"drip sake\".\n* '''Tobingakoi''' ({{lang|ja|\u6597\u74f6\u56f2\u3044}}) is sake pressed into {{convert|18|l|impgal USgal|sp=us|adj=on}} bottles (\"tobin\") with the brewer selecting the best sake of the batch for shipping.\n\n===Others===\n* '''[[Amazake]]''' ({{lang|ja|\u7518\u9152}}) is a traditional sweet, low-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice.\n* '''Doburoku''' ({{lang|ja|\u6fc1\u9152}}) is the classic home-brew style of sake (although home brewing is illegal in Japan). It is created by simply adding ''k\u014dji'' mold to steamed rice and water and letting the mixture ferment. The resulting sake is somewhat like a chunkier version of nigorizake.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Jizake}}''' ({{lang|ja|\u5730\u9152}}) is locally brewed sake, the equivalent of [[microbrewing]] beer.\n* '''Kuroshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u9ed2\u9152}}) is sake made from unpolished rice (i.e., brown rice), and is more like [[Huangjiu|Chinese rice wine]].\n* '''Teiseihaku-shu''' ({{lang|ja|\u4f4e\u7cbe\u767d\u9152}}) is sake with a deliberately high rice-polishing ratio. It is generally held that the lower the rice polishing ratio (the percent weight after polishing), the better the potential of the sake. However, beginning around 2005, teiseihaku-shu has been produced as a specialty sake made with high rice-polishing ratios, usually around 80%, to produce sake with the characteristic flavor of rice itself.\n\nSome other terms commonly used in connection with sake:\n* ''Nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}), also called the Sake Meter Value, or SMV\n::<math>\\text{SMV} = \\left( \\left| \\frac{1}\\text{specific gravity} \\right| - 1 \\right) \\times 1443</math>\n:[[Specific gravity]] is measured on a scale weighing the same volume of water at {{convert|4|C}} and sake at {{convert|15|C}}. The sweeter the sake, the lower the number. When the SMV was first used, 0 was designated the point between sweet sake and dry sake. Now +3 is considered neutral.\n* ''Seimai-buai'' ({{lang|ja|\u7cbe\u7c73\u6b69\u5408}}) is the rice polishing ratio, the percentage of weight remaining after polishing. Generally, the lower the number, the better the sake's potential. A lower percentage usually results in a fruitier sake, whereas a higher percentage will taste more like rice.\n* ''[[Sake kasu|Kasu]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7c95}}) are pressed sake lees, the solids left after pressing and filtering. These are used for making [[tsukemono|pickles]], livestock feed, and [[sh\u014dch\u016b]], and as an ingredient in dishes like kasu soup.\n\n==Taste and flavor==\n\nThe label on a bottle of sake gives a rough indication of its taste. Terms found on the label may include ''nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}), ''san-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u9178\u5ea6}}), and ''aminosan-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u5ea6}}).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nihonshu-do; Acidity in Sake | publisher = Sake World | date = 2002-03-01 | first = John | last = Gauntner | issue = 29| id = | url = http://www.sake-world.com/html/sw-2002_2.html | access-date = 2014-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325113057/http://sake-world.com/html/sw-2002_2.html|archive-date=March 25, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=article mentions san-do but not aminosan-do; anyway is this a reliable source?}}\n\n''Nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}) is calculated from the [[specific gravity]] of the sake and indicates the sugar and alcohol content of the sake on an arbitrary scale. Typical values are between \u22123 (sweet) and +10 (dry), equivalent to specific gravities ranging between 1.007 and 0.998.\n\n''San-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u9178\u5ea6}}) indicates the [[concentration]] of acid, which is determined by [[titration]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] solution. This number is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the acid in {{convert|10|ml|abbr=on}} of sake.\n\n''Aminosan-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u5ea6}}) indicates a taste of [[umami]] or savoriness. As the proportion of [[amino acid]]s rises, the sake tastes more savory. This number is determined by titration of the sake with a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and [[formaldehyde]], and is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the amino acids in 10&nbsp;ml of sake.\n\nSake can have many [[Aroma of wine|flavor notes]], such as fruits, flowers, herbs, and spices. Many types of sake have notes of apple from [[ethyl caproate]], and banana from [[isoamyl acetate]], particularly {{nihongo|''ginj\u014dshu''|\u541f\u91b8\u9152}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Serving sake==\n{{Main|Sake set}}\n[[File:Sake set.jpg|right|thumb|Sake can be served in a wide variety of cups; here is a ''sakazuki'' (a flat, saucer-like cup), an ''ochoko'' (a small, cylindrical cup), and a ''[[Masu (Japanese)|masu]]'' (a wooden, box-like cup).]]\n[[File:Japanese - Sake Ewer from a Portable Picnic Set - Walters 49957 - Three Quarter View A.jpg|thumb|\"Sake Ewer from a Portable Picnic Set\", Japan, c. 1830 - 1839.]]\nIn Japan, sake is served chilled (''reishu'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u9152}}), at room temperature (''j\u014don'' {{lang|ja|\u5e38\u6e29}} or ''hiya'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u3084}}), or heated (''atsukan'' {{lang|ja|[[:ja:\u71d7\u9152|\u71b1\u71d7]]}}), depending on the preference of the drinker, the quality of the sake, and the season. Typically, hot sake is a winter drink, and high-grade sake is not drunk hot, because the flavors and aromas will be lost. This masking of flavor is the reason that low-quality and old sake is often served hot. There are gradations of temperature both for chilling and heating, about every {{convert|5|C-change}}, with hot sake generally served around {{convert|50|C}}, and chilled sake around {{convert|10|C}}, like white wine. Hot sake that has cooled (''kanzamashi'' {{lang|ja|\u71d7\u51b7\u307e\u3057}}) may be reheated.\n\nSake is traditionally drunk from small cups called ''choko'' or ''o-choko'' ({{lang|ja|\u304a\u732a\u53e3}}) and poured into the choko from ceramic flasks called ''tokkuri''. This is very common for hot sake, where the flask is heated in hot water and the small cups ensure that the sake does not get cold in the cup, but may also be used for chilled sake. Traditionally one does not pour one's own drink, which is known as ''tejaku'' ({{lang|ja|\u624b\u914c}}), but instead members of a party pour for each other, which is known as ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|\u914c}}). This has relaxed in recent years, but is generally observed on more formal occasions, such as business meals, and is still often observed for the first drink.\n\nAnother traditional cup is the ''[[Masu (Japanese)|masu]]'', a box usually made of ''[[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki]]'' or ''[[Cryptomeria|sugi]]'', which was originally used for measuring rice. The masu holds exactly {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}}, so the sake is served by filling the masu to the brim; this is done for chilled or room temperature sake. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the masu or put the masu on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers.\n\nSaucer-like cups called ''sakazuki'' are also used, most commonly at weddings and other ceremonial occasions, such as the start of the year or at the beginning of a [[kaiseki]] meal. In cheap bars, sake is often served room temperature in glass tumblers and called ''koppu-zake'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7\u9152}}). In more modern restaurants wine glasses are also used, and recently footed glasses made specifically for premium sake have also come into use.\n\nSake is traditionally served in units of {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (one ''g\u014d''), and this is still common, but other sizes are sometimes also available.\n\nTraditionally sake is heated immediately before serving, but today restaurants may buy sake in boxes which can be heated in a specialized hot sake dispenser, thus allowing hot sake to be served immediately, though this is detrimental to the flavor. There are also a variety of devices for heating sake and keeping it warm, beyond the traditional tokkuri.\n\nAside from being served straight, sake can be used as a mixer for [[cocktail]]s, such as [[tamagozake]], [[saketini]]s or nogasake.<ref>''Ume Cocktail Menu''.

While it can now be brewed year-round, there is still seasonality associated with sake, particularly artisanal ones. The most visible symbol of this is the ''sugitama'' ({{lang|ja|\u6749\u7389}}), a globe of [[Cedrus|cedar]] leaves traditionally hung outside a brewery when the new sake is brewed. The leaves start green, but turn brown over time, reflecting the maturation of the sake. These are now hung outside many restaurants serving sake. The new year's sake is called ''shinshu'' {{lang|ja|\u65b0\u9152}} (\"new sake\"), and when initially released in late winter or early spring, many brewers have a celebration, known as ''kurabiraki'' {{lang|ja|\u8535\u958b\u304d}} (warehouse opening). Traditionally sake was best transported in the cool spring, to avoid spoilage in the summer heat, with a secondary transport in autumn, once the weather had cooled, known as ''hiyaoroshi'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u5378\u3057}} (\"cold wholesale distribution\") \u2013 this autumn sake has matured over the summer.\n\nThere is not traditionally a notion of [[vintage]] of sake \u2013 it is generally drunk within the year, and if aged, it does not vary significantly from year to year. Today, with influence from [[wine]] vintages, some breweries label sake intended for aging with a vintage, but this is otherwise rare.\n\n==Storage==\nSake is sold in volume units divisible by {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (a ''[[G\u014d (unit of measurement)|g\u014d]]''), the [[Japanese units of measurement|traditional Japanese unit]] for [[Cup (unit)|cup size]]: sake is traditionally sold by the g\u014d-sized cup, or in a {{convert|1.8|l|floz|abbr=on}} (one ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Volume|sh\u014d]],'' ten g\u014d) sized flask. Today sake is also often sold in {{convert|720|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (four g\u014d) bottles \u2013 note that this is almost the same as the {{convert|750|ml|floz|abbr=on}} standard for [[wine bottle]]s, but is divisible into 4 g\u014d. Particularly in convenience stores, sake may be sold in a {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} single serving glass with a pull-off top ({{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u9152}} ''kappu-zake'') \u2013 this is generally cheap sake \u2013 or in a small {{convert|360|ml|floz|abbr=on}} bottle.\n\nIn general, it is best to keep sake refrigerated in a cool or dark room, as prolonged exposure to heat or direct light will lead to spoilage. In addition, sake stored at relatively high temperature can lead to formation of [[dicetopiperazine]], a cyclo (Pro-Leu) that makes it bitter as it ages <ref>(Lecture Note, Oct. 2011).</ref> Sake has high microbiological stability due to its high content of ethanol. However, incidences of spoilage have been known to occur.  One of the microorganisms implicated in this spoilage is [[lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB) that has grown tolerant to ethanol and is referred to as hiochi-bacteria.<ref>(Suzuki ''et al.'', 2008).</ref> Sake stored at room temperature is best consumed within a few months after purchase.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nAfter opening a bottle of sake, it is best consumed within 2 or 3 hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is possible to store sake in the refrigerator, but it is recommended to finish the sake within 2 days.  This is because once premium sake is opened it begins to oxidize, which affects the taste.  If the sake is kept in the refrigerator for more than 3 days, it will lose its \"best\" flavor.  However, this does not mean it should be disposed of if not consumed.  Generally, sake can keep very well and still taste just fine after weeks in the refrigerator.  How long a sake will remain drinkable depends on the quality of the  product, and whether it is sealed with a vacuum top which removes air and helps decrease oxidation.\n\n==Ceremonial use==\n[[File:Sake before the kagami biraki.jpg|thumb|upright|A cask of sake before the [[kagami biraki]]]]\n[[File:SakeContainers.jpg|thumb|Decorative sake containers in a [[Nakatsugawa]] shop]]\nSake is often consumed as part of [[Shinto]] purification rituals. Sake served to gods as offerings prior to drinking are called {{nihongo|''o-miki''|[[wikt:\u5fa1\u795e\u9152#Japanese|\u5fa1\u795e\u9152]]}} or {{nihongo|''miki''|[[wikt:\u795e\u9152#Japanese|\u795e\u9152]]}}.\n\nIn a ceremony called ''[[kagami biraki]]'', wooden casks of sake are opened with mallets during Shinto festivals, weddings, store openings, sports and election victories, and other celebrations.

Despite the name, unlike [[wine]], in which [[Ethanol|alcohol]] is produced by [[Fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] sugar that is naturally present in fruit (typically grapes), sake is produced by a [[brewing]] process more akin to that of [[beer]], where [[starch]] is converted into sugars, which ferment into alcohol.\n\nThe brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other [[rice wine]]s, when ''sake'' is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. Furthermore, the alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3\u20139% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], wine generally contains 9\u201316% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/10 10]}}</ref> and undiluted sake contains 18\u201320% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water prior to bottling).\n\nIn [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the word ''sake'' ([[kanji]]: [[wikt:\u9152#Japanese|\u9152]], {{IPA-ja|sake}}) can refer to any [[alcoholic drink]], while the beverage called \"sake\" in English is usually termed '''''nihonshu''''' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152}}; meaning 'Japanese liquor'). Under Japanese [[liquor laws]], sake is labelled with the word \"'''''seishu'''''\" ({{lang|ja|\u6e05\u9152}}; 'clear liquor'), a synonym not commonly used in conversation.\n\nIn Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special [[ceremony]], where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or [[porcelain]] bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a ''[[Sake set#Drinking cups|sakazuki]]''. As with wine, the recommended ''serving temperature'' of sake varies greatly by type.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of sake is unclear.

Around 30,000 breweries sprang up around the country within a year. However, as the years went by, the government levied more and more taxes on the sake industry and slowly the number of breweries dwindled to 8,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nMost of the breweries that grew and survived this period were set up by wealthy landowners. Landowners who grew rice crops would have rice left over at the end of the season and, rather than letting these leftovers go to waste, would ship it to their breweries. The most successful of these family breweries still operate today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nDuring the 20th century, sake-brewing technology grew by leaps and bounds. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the very first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. Yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and being devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered wooden barrels to be unhygienic because of the potential bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using wooden barrels means that a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (somewhere around 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This was the end of the wooden-barrel age of sake and the use of wooden barrels in brewing was completely eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn Japan, sake has long been taxed by the national government. In 1898, this tax brought in about [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]5&nbsp;million out of a total of about \u00a5120&nbsp;million, about 4.6% of the government's total direct tax income.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Casal |first=U. A. |year=1939 |title=Some notes on the Sakazuki and the Role of Drinking Sake in Japan |journal=[[Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan]] |page=73}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905, the government banned the home brewing of sake. At the time, sake still made up an astonishing 30% of Japan's tax revenue. Since home-brewed sake is tax-free sake, the logic was that by banning the home brewing of sake, sales would go up, and more tax money would be collected. This was the end of home-brewed sake, and the law remains in effect today even though sake sales now make up only 2% of government income.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nWhen [[World War II]] brought rice shortages, the sake-brewing industry was dealt a hefty blow as the government clamped down on the use of rice for brewing. As early as the late 17th century, it had been discovered that small amounts of alcohol could be added to sake before pressing to extract aromas and flavors from the rice solids, but during the war, pure alcohol and [[glucose]] were added to small quantities of rice mash, increasing the yield by as much as four times. 75% of today's sake is made using this technique, left over from the war years. There were even a few breweries producing \"sake\" that contained no rice at all. Naturally, the quality of sake during this time varied greatly.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter the war, breweries slowly began to recover, and the quality of sake gradually went up. However, new players on the scene\u2014beer, wine, and spirits\u2014became very popular in Japan, and in the 1960s beer consumption surpassed sake for the first time. Sake consumption continued to go down while, in contrast, the quality of sake steadily improved.\n\nToday, sake has become a world beverage with a few breweries springing up in China, Southeast Asia, South America, North America, and Australia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2019/05/04/food/american-based-breweries-creating-brand-sake/|title=American-based breweries are creating their own brand of sake|last=Hirano|first=Ko|date=2019-05-04|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2019-12-04|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref> More breweries are also turning to older methods of production.\n\nWhile the rest of the world may be drinking more sake and the quality of sake has been increasing, sake production in Japan has been declining since the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gauntner|first= John |year=2002 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=5y7X-mfWCEIC&printsec=frontcover#PPA78,M1 |title=The Sake Handbook| page= 78|isbn= 9780804834254 }}</ref> The number of sake breweries is also declining.

Unrefined sake was squeezed out at the brewery and there are about 180 holes (60 cm  wide, 20 cm deep) for holding storage jars. A hollow (1.8 meter wide, 1 meter deep) for a pot to collect drops of pressed sake and 14th-century [[Bizen ware]] jars were also found. It is estimated to be utilized until the [[Onin War]] (1467-1477). Sake was brewed at [[Tenry\u016b-ji]] during the [[Muromachi Period]] (1336-1573).<ref>{{cite web |title=Oldest sake brewery found at former temple site in Kyoto |url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ202001190005.html |publisher= The Asahi Shimbun |access-date=January 20, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brasserie de sak\u00e9 Takayama.jpg|thumb|Sake brewery, [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]], with a ''sugitama'' (\u6749\u7389) globe of cedar leaves indicating sake.]]\n\n===Rice===\nThe rice used for brewing sake is called ''saka mai'' {{lang|ja|\u9152\u7c73}} (sake rice), or officially ''shuz\u014d k\u014dtekimai'' {{lang|ja|\u9152\u9020\u597d\u9069\u7c73}} (sake-brewing suitable rice). There are at least 80 types of sake rice in Japan.\nAmong these, [[Yamada Nishiki|Yamadanishiki]], Gohyakumangoku, Miyamanishiki and Omachi rice are very popular.\nThe grain is larger, stronger (If a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing), and contains less protein and lipid than the ordinary rice eaten by the Japanese.\nSake rice is used only for making sake, because it is unpalatable for eating.\n\nSake rice is usually polished to a much higher degree than rice that is used for eating.\nThe reason for polishing is a result of the composition and structure of the rice grain itself.\nThe core of the rice grain is rich in starch, while the outer layers of the grain contain higher concentrations of fats, vitamins and proteins.\nSince higher concentration of fat and protein in the sake would lead to off-flavors and contribute rough elements to the sake, the outer layers of the sake rice grain is milled away in a polishing process, leaving only the starchy part of the grain (some sake brewers remove over 60% of the rice grain in the polishing process).\nThat desirable pocket of starch in the center of the grain is called the shinpaku (\u5fc3\u767d).\nIt usually takes 2 to 3 days to polish rice down to less than half its original size. The rice powder that is a by-product of the polishing is very often used for making [[rice crackers]], or Japanese sweets (i.e. [[Dango]]), and other food stuffs.\n\nIf the sake is made with rice that has a higher percentage of its husk and outer portion of the core milled off, then more rice will be required to make that particular sake, and it will take longer to make. As a result, sake made with rice that has been highly milled (much of the rice has been polished off) is usually more expensive than a sake that has been made using less polished rice. However, this does not always mean that sake made by highly milled rice is of better quality than sake made by rice that has been milled less.\n\n'''Rice polishing ratio''', called ''Seimai-buai'' {{lang|ja|\u7cbe\u7c73\u6b69\u5408}} (see [[Glossary of sake terms]]) measures the degree of rice polishing. For example, rice polishing ratio of 60% means that the 60% of the original rice grain remains and the 40% has been polished away.\n\n===Water===\nWater is one of the important ingredients for making sake.  It is involved in almost every major process of sake brewing from washing the rice to dilution of the final product before bottling.  The mineral content of the water can play a large role in the final product.  [[Iron]] will bond with an [[amino acid]] produced by the k\u014dji to produce off flavors and a yellowish color.  [[Manganese]], when exposed to ultraviolet light, will also contribute to discoloration.  Conversely [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[phosphoric acid]] serve as nutrients for yeast during fermentation and are considered desirable.<ref name=water>{{cite web|last=Gauntner|first=John|title=How Sake Is Made|url=http://sake-world.com/about-sake/how-sake-is-made/the-water/|publisher=Sake World|accessdate=January 1, 2016}}</ref>  The yeast will use those nutrients to work faster and multiply resulting in more sugar being converted into alcohol. While soft water will typically yield sweeter sake, hard water with a higher nutrient content is known for producing [[Dryness (taste)|drier-style]] sake.\n\nThe first region known for having great water was the [[Nada-Gog\u014d]] in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]].  A particular water source called \"Miyamizu\" was found to produce high quality sake and attract many producers to the region.  To this day Hy\u014dgo has the most sake brewers of any prefecture.<ref name=water />\n\nTypically breweries source their water from wells, though lakes and rivers can be used as well.  Also breweries may use tap water and filter and adjust components as they see fit.<ref name=water />\n\n=== K\u014dji-kin ===\n''K\u014dji-kin'' (''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'') spores are another important component of sake.

therefore especially susceptible to infections in general.<ref name=\":3\" /> Aside from these cases, there is no evidence to indicate ''A. oryzae'' is a harmful pathogen to either plants or animals in the scientific literature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Therefore, Health Canada considers ''A. oryzae'' \u201cunlikely to be a serious hazard to [[livestock]] or to other organisms,\u201d including \"healthy or debilitated humans.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Given its safety record in the scientific literature and extensive history of safe use (spanning several hundred years) in the Japanese food industry, the FDA and [[World Health Organization]] ([[World Health Organization|WHO]]) also support the safety of ''A. oryzae'' for use in the production of foods like sake.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the U.S., the FDA classifies ''A.oryzae'' as a [[Generally recognized as safe|Generally Recognized as Safe]] ([[Generally recognized as safe|GRAS]]) organism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n[[File:Moromi.JPG|thumb|Moromi (the main fermenting mash) undergoing fermentation|alt=|159x159px]]\n\nSake fermentation is a 3-step process called ''sandan shikomi''.<ref name=\":4\" /> The first step, called ''hatsuzoe'', involves the steamed rice, water, and k\u014dji-kin being added to the yeast starter called ''shubo,'' which is made from a mixture of steamed rice, water, [[Aspergillus oryzae|k\u014dji]], and yeast.<ref name=\":4\" /> This mixture becomes known as the ''moromi'' (the main mash during sake fermentation).<ref name=\":4\" /> The high yeast content of the shubo promotes the fermentation of the ''moromi.''<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.japansake.or.jp/sake/english/howto/process.html|title=Brewing Process {{!}} How to {{!}} Japan Sake and Shochu Makers

step (the third day of the process), called ''nakazoe'', involves the addition of a second batch of k\u014dji, steamed rice, and water to the mixture.<ref name=\":4\" /> On the fourth day of the fermentation, the third step of the process, called ''tomezoe'', takes place.<ref name=\":4\" /> Here, the third and final batch of k\u014dji, steamed rice, and water is added to the mixture to complete the 3-step process.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe fermentation process of sake is a multiple parallel fermentation, which is unique to sake.<ref name=\":4\" /> Multiple parallel fermentation is the conversion of starch into glucose followed by immediate conversion into alcohol.<ref name=\":5\" /> This process distinguishes sake from other [[liquor]]s like beer because it occurs in a single vat, whereas with beer, for instance, starch to glucose conversion and glucose to alcohol conversion occur in separate vats.<ref name=\":5\" /> The breakdown of starch into glucose is caused by the k\u014dji-kin fungus, while the conversion of glucose into alcohol is caused by yeast.<ref name=\":5\" /> Due to the yeast being available as soon as the glucose is produced, the conversion of glucose to alcohol is very efficient in sake brewing.<ref name=\":5\" /> This results in sake having a generally higher alcohol content than other types of liquor.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite

complete, the fermented moromi is pushed through a press to remove the sake [[Lees (fermentation)|lees]] and then pasteurized and filtered for color.<ref name=\":4\" /> The sake is then stored in bottles under cold conditions (see \"Maturation\" below).<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe entire process of making sake can range from 60\u201390 days (2\u20133 months), while the fermentation alone can take two weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sake-world.com/about-sake/how-sake-is-made/sake-brewing-process/|title=Sake brewing process|last=Gauntner|first=John|date=|website=Sake

Nine to twelve months are required for sake to mature. Maturation is caused by physical and chemical factors such as oxygen supply, the broad application of external heat, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes and amino acids, among other unknown factors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=National Research Institute of Brewing|date=March 2017|title=Sake Brewing: The Integration of Science and Technology|url=http://www.nrib.go.jp/English/sake/pdf/SakeNo02_en.pdf|journal=The Story of Sake|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===T\u014dji===\n{{nihongo|T\u014dji|\u675c\u6c0f}} is the job title of the sake [[brewer]], named after [[Du Kang]]. It is a highly respected job in the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese society]], with t\u014dji being regarded like [[Japanese music|musicians]] or [[Japanese painting|painters]]. The title of t\u014dji was historically passed on from father to son; today new t\u014dji are either veteran brewery workers or are trained at universities. While modern breweries with refrigeration and cooling tanks operate year-round, most old-fashioned sake breweries are seasonal, operating only in the cool winter months. During the summer and fall most t\u014dji work elsewhere, and are commonly found on farms, only periodically returning to the brewery to supervise storage conditions or bottling operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esake.com/Knowledge/Ingredients/People/people.html|title=The People|publisher=eSake}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Varieties==\n\n===Special-designation sake===\nThere are two basic types of sake: {{nihongo||\u666e\u901a\u9152|'''Futs\u016b-shu'''|ordinary sake}} and {{nihongo||\u7279\u5b9a\u540d\u79f0\u9152|'''Tokutei meish\u014d-shu'''|special-designation sake}}. ''Futs\u016b-shu'' is the equivalent of [[table wine]] and accounts for the majority of sake produced. ''Tokutei meish\u014d-shu'' refers to premium sake distinguished by the degree to which the rice has been polished and the added percentage of brewer's alcohol or the absence of such additives. There are eight varieties of special-designation sake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nta.go.jp/shiraberu/senmonjoho/sake/hyoji/seishu/gaiyo/02.htm\n|title=<span lang=\"ja\">\u300c\u6e05\u9152\u306e\u88fd\u6cd5\u54c1\u8cea\u8868\u793a\u57fa\u6e96\u300d\u306e\u6982\u8981</span>\n|trans-title=Summary of Sake brewing quality labeling standard |publisher=National Tax Agency Japan|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nThe four main grades of sake are ''junmai'', ''honjozo'', ''ginjo'' and ''daiginjo''.

This method was the standard for 300 years, but it is rare today.\n* '''Yamahai''' ({{lang|ja|\u5c71\u5ec3}}) is a simplified version of the kimoto method, introduced in the early 1900s. Yamahai skips the step of making a paste out of the starter mash. That step of the kimoto method is known as yama-oroshi, and the full name for yamahai is \u201cyama-oroshi haishi\u201d ({{lang|ja|\u5c71\u5378\u5ec3\u6b62}}), meaning \u201cdiscontinuation of yama-oroshi.\u201d While the yamahai method was originally developed to speed production time, it is slower than the modern method and is now used only in specialty brews for the earthy flavors it produces.\n* '''Sokuj\u014d''' ({{lang|ja|\u901f\u91b8}}), \"quick fermentation\", is the modern method of preparing the starter mash. Lactic acid, produced naturally in the two slower traditional methods, is added to the starter to inhibit unwanted bacteria. Sokuj\u014d sake tends to have a lighter flavor than kimoto or yamahai.\n\n===Different handling after fermentation===\n[[File:Unfiltered Sake at Gyu-Kaku.jpg|thumb|[[Nigori]], or unfiltered sake]]\n* '''Namazake''' ({{lang|ja|\u751f\u9152}}) is sake that has not been [[pasteurization|pasteurized]]. It requires refrigerated storage and has a shorter shelf-life than pasteurized sake.\n* '''Genshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u539f\u9152}}) is undiluted sake. Most sake is diluted with water after brewing to lower the alcohol content from 18\u201320% down to 14\u201316%, but genshu is not.\n* '''Muroka''' ({{lang|ja|\u7121\u6ffe\u904e}}) means unfiltered. It refers to sake that has not been carbon filtered, but which ''has'' been pressed and separated from the lees, and thus is clear, not cloudy.  Carbon filtration can remove desirable flavors and odors as well as bad ones, thus muroka sake has stronger flavors than filtered varieties.\n* '''[[Nigori]]zake''' ({{lang|ja|\u6fc1\u308a\u9152}}) is cloudy sake. The sake is passed through a loose mesh to separate it from the mash.  It is not filtered thereafter and there is much rice sediment in the bottle. Before serving, the bottle is shaken to mix the sediment and turn the sake white or cloudy.\n* '''Seishu''' ({{lang|ja|\u6e05\u9152}}), \"clear/clean sake\", is the Japanese legal definition of sake and refers to sake in which the solids have been strained out, leaving clear liquid.  Thus nigorizake and ''doburoku'' (see below) are not seishu and therefore are not actually sake under Japanese law. However, nigorizake can receive the seishu status by being strained clear and having the lees put back in afterward.\n* '''Koshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u53e4\u9152}}) is \"aged sake\". Most sake does not age well, but this specially made type can age for decades, turning yellow and acquiring a honeyed flavor.\n* '''Taruzake''' ({{lang|ja|\u6a3d\u9152}}) is sake aged in wooden barrels or bottled in wooden casks. The wood used is ''[[Cryptomeria]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u6749}}, ''sugi''), which is also known as Japanese cedar. Sake casks are often tapped ceremonially for the opening of buildings, businesses, parties, etc. Because the wood imparts a strong flavor, premium sake is rarely used for this type.\n* '''Shiboritate''' ({{lang|ja|\u643e\u7acb\u3066}}), \"freshly pressed\", refers to sake that has been shipped without the traditional six-month aging/maturation period.  The result is usually a more acidic, \"greener\" sake.\n* '''Fukurozuri''' ({{lang|ja|\u888b\u540a\u308a}}) is a method of separating sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under its own weight. Sake produced this way is sometimes called ''shizukuzake'' ({{lang|ja|\u96eb\u9152}}), meaning \"drip sake\".\n* '''Tobingakoi''' ({{lang|ja|\u6597\u74f6\u56f2\u3044}}) is sake pressed into {{convert|18|l|impgal USgal|sp=us|adj=on}} bottles (\"tobin\") with the brewer selecting the best sake of the batch for shipping.\n\n===Others===\n* '''[[Amazake]]''' ({{lang|ja|\u7518\u9152}}) is a traditional sweet, low-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice.\n* '''Doburoku''' ({{lang|ja|\u6fc1\u9152}}) is the classic home-brew style of sake (although home brewing is illegal in Japan). It is created by simply adding ''k\u014dji'' mold to steamed rice and water and letting the mixture ferment. The resulting sake is somewhat like a chunkier version of nigorizake.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Jizake}}''' ({{lang|ja|\u5730\u9152}}) is locally brewed sake, the equivalent of [[microbrewing]] beer.\n* '''Kuroshu''' ({{lang|ja|\u9ed2\u9152}}) is sake made from unpolished rice (i.e., brown rice), and is more like [[Huangjiu|Chinese rice wine]].\n* '''Teiseihaku-shu''' ({{lang|ja|\u4f4e\u7cbe\u767d\u9152}}) is sake with a deliberately high rice-polishing ratio. It is generally held that the lower the rice polishing ratio (the percent weight after polishing), the better the potential of the sake. However, beginning around 2005, teiseihaku-shu has been produced as a specialty sake made with high rice-polishing ratios, usually around 80%, to produce sake with the characteristic flavor of rice itself.\n\nSome other terms commonly used in connection with sake:\n* ''Nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}), also called the Sake Meter Value, or SMV\n::<math>\\text{SMV} = \\left( \\left| \\frac{1}\\text{specific gravity} \\right| - 1 \\right) \\times 1443</math>\n:[[Specific gravity]] is measured on a scale weighing the same volume of water at {{convert|4|C}} and sake at {{convert|15|C}}. The sweeter the sake, the lower the number. When the SMV was first used, 0 was designated the point between sweet sake and dry sake. Now +3 is considered neutral.\n* ''Seimai-buai'' ({{lang|ja|\u7cbe\u7c73\u6b69\u5408}}) is the rice polishing ratio, the percentage of weight remaining after polishing. Generally, the lower the number, the better the sake's potential. A lower percentage usually results in a fruitier sake, whereas a higher percentage will taste more like rice.\n* ''[[Sake kasu|Kasu]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u7c95}}) are pressed sake lees, the solids left after pressing and filtering. These are used for making [[tsukemono|pickles]], livestock feed, and [[sh\u014dch\u016b]], and as an ingredient in dishes like kasu soup.\n\n==Taste and flavor==\n\nThe label on a bottle of sake gives a rough indication of its taste. Terms found on the label may include ''nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}), ''san-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u9178\u5ea6}}), and ''aminosan-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u5ea6}}).<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nihonshu-do; Acidity in Sake | publisher = Sake World | date = 2002-03-01 | first = John | last = Gauntner | issue = 29| id = | url = http://www.sake-world.com/html/sw-2002_2.html | access-date = 2014-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325113057/http://sake-world.com/html/sw-2002_2.html|archive-date=March 25, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=article mentions san-do but not aminosan-do; anyway is this a reliable source?}}\n\n''Nihonshu-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u5ea6}}) is calculated from the [[specific gravity]] of the sake and indicates the sugar and alcohol content of the sake on an arbitrary scale. Typical values are between \u22123 (sweet) and +10 (dry), equivalent to specific gravities ranging between 1.007 and 0.998.\n\n''San-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u9178\u5ea6}}) indicates the [[concentration]] of acid, which is determined by [[titration]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] solution. This number is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the acid in {{convert|10|ml|abbr=on}} of sake.\n\n''Aminosan-do'' ({{lang|ja|\u30a2\u30df\u30ce\u9178\u5ea6}}) indicates a taste of [[umami]] or savoriness. As the proportion of [[amino acid]]s rises, the sake tastes more savory. This number is determined by titration of the sake with a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and [[formaldehyde]], and is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the amino acids in 10&nbsp;ml of sake.\n\nSake can have many [[Aroma of wine|flavor notes]], such as fruits, flowers, herbs, and spices. Many types of sake have notes of apple from [[ethyl caproate]], and banana from [[isoamyl acetate]], particularly {{nihongo|''ginj\u014dshu''|\u541f\u91b8\u9152}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Serving sake==\n{{Main|Sake set}}\n[[File:Sake set.jpg|right|thumb|Sake can be served in a wide variety of cups; here is a ''sakazuki'' (a flat, saucer-like cup), an ''ochoko'' (a small, cylindrical cup), and a ''[[Masu (Japanese)|masu]]'' (a wooden, box-like cup).]]\n[[File:Japanese - Sake Ewer from a Portable Picnic Set - Walters 49957 - Three Quarter View A.jpg|thumb|\"Sake Ewer from a Portable Picnic Set\", Japan, c. 1830 - 1839.]]\nIn Japan, sake is served chilled (''reishu'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u9152}}), at room temperature (''j\u014don'' {{lang|ja|\u5e38\u6e29}} or ''hiya'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u3084}}), or heated (''atsukan'' {{lang|ja|[[:ja:\u71d7\u9152|\u71b1\u71d7]]}}), depending on the preference of the drinker, the quality of the sake, and the season. Typically, hot sake is a winter drink, and high-grade sake is not drunk hot, because the flavors and aromas will be lost. This masking of flavor is the reason that low-quality and old sake is often served hot. There are gradations of temperature both for chilling and heating, about every {{convert|5|C-change}}, with hot sake generally served around {{convert|50|C}}, and chilled sake around {{convert|10|C}}, like white wine. Hot sake that has cooled (''kanzamashi'' {{lang|ja|\u71d7\u51b7\u307e\u3057}}) may be reheated.\n\nSake is traditionally drunk from small cups called ''choko'' or ''o-choko'' ({{lang|ja|\u304a\u732a\u53e3}}) and poured into the choko from ceramic flasks called ''tokkuri''. This is very common for hot sake, where the flask is heated in hot water and the small cups ensure that the sake does not get cold in the cup, but may also be used for chilled sake. Traditionally one does not pour one's own drink, which is known as ''tejaku'' ({{lang|ja|\u624b\u914c}}), but instead members of a party pour for each other, which is known as ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|\u914c}}). This has relaxed in recent years, but is generally observed on more formal occasions, such as business meals, and is still often observed for the first drink.\n\nAnother traditional cup is the ''[[Masu (Japanese)|masu]]'', a box usually made of ''[[Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki]]'' or ''[[Cryptomeria|sugi]]'', which was originally used for measuring rice. The masu holds exactly {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}}, so the sake is served by filling the masu to the brim; this is done for chilled or room temperature sake. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the masu or put the masu on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers.\n\nSaucer-like cups called ''sakazuki'' are also used, most commonly at weddings and other ceremonial occasions, such as the start of the year or at the beginning of a [[kaiseki]] meal. In cheap bars, sake is often served room temperature in glass tumblers and called ''koppu-zake'' ({{lang|ja|\u30b3\u30c3\u30d7\u9152}}). In more modern restaurants wine glasses are also used, and recently footed glasses made specifically for premium sake have also come into use.\n\nSake is traditionally served in units of {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (one ''g\u014d''), and this is still common, but other sizes are sometimes also available.\n\nTraditionally sake is heated immediately before serving, but today restaurants may buy sake in boxes which can be heated in a specialized hot sake dispenser, thus allowing hot sake to be served immediately, though this is detrimental to the flavor. There are also a variety of devices for heating sake and keeping it warm, beyond the traditional tokkuri.\n\nAside from being served straight, sake can be used as a mixer for [[cocktail]]s, such as [[tamagozake]], [[saketini]]s or nogasake.<ref>''Ume Cocktail Menu''.

While it can now be brewed year-round, there is still seasonality associated with sake, particularly artisanal ones. The most visible symbol of this is the ''sugitama'' ({{lang|ja|\u6749\u7389}}), a globe of [[Cedrus|cedar]] leaves traditionally hung outside a brewery when the new sake is brewed. The leaves start green, but turn brown over time, reflecting the maturation of the sake. These are now hung outside many restaurants serving sake. The new year's sake is called ''shinshu'' {{lang|ja|\u65b0\u9152}} (\"new sake\"), and when initially released in late winter or early spring, many brewers have a celebration, known as ''kurabiraki'' {{lang|ja|\u8535\u958b\u304d}} (warehouse opening). Traditionally sake was best transported in the cool spring, to avoid spoilage in the summer heat, with a secondary transport in autumn, once the weather had cooled, known as ''hiyaoroshi'' {{lang|ja|\u51b7\u5378\u3057}} (\"cold wholesale distribution\") \u2013 this autumn sake has matured over the summer.\n\nThere is not traditionally a notion of [[vintage]] of sake \u2013 it is generally drunk within the year, and if aged, it does not vary significantly from year to year. Today, with influence from [[wine]] vintages, some breweries label sake intended for aging with a vintage, but this is otherwise rare.\n\n==Storage==\nSake is sold in volume units divisible by {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (a ''[[G\u014d (unit of measurement)|g\u014d]]''), the [[Japanese units of measurement|traditional Japanese unit]] for [[Cup (unit)|cup size]]: sake is traditionally sold by the g\u014d-sized cup, or in a {{convert|1.8|l|floz|abbr=on}} (one ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Volume|sh\u014d]],'' ten g\u014d) sized flask. Today sake is also often sold in {{convert|720|ml|floz|abbr=on}} (four g\u014d) bottles \u2013 note that this is almost the same as the {{convert|750|ml|floz|abbr=on}} standard for [[wine bottle]]s, but is divisible into 4 g\u014d. Particularly in convenience stores, sake may be sold in a {{convert|180|ml|floz|abbr=on}} single serving glass with a pull-off top ({{lang|ja|\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u9152}} ''kappu-zake'') \u2013 this is generally cheap sake \u2013 or in a small {{convert|360|ml|floz|abbr=on}} bottle.\n\nIn general, it is best to keep sake refrigerated in a cool or dark room, as prolonged exposure to heat or direct light will lead to spoilage. In addition, sake stored at relatively high temperature can lead to formation of [[dicetopiperazine]], a cyclo (Pro-Leu) that makes it bitter as it ages <ref>(Lecture Note, Oct. 2011).</ref> Sake has high microbiological stability due to its high content of ethanol. However, incidences of spoilage have been known to occur.  One of the microorganisms implicated in this spoilage is [[lactic acid bacteria]] (LAB) that has grown tolerant to ethanol and is referred to as hiochi-bacteria.<ref>(Suzuki ''et al.'', 2008).</ref> Sake stored at room temperature is best consumed within a few months after purchase.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nAfter opening a bottle of sake, it is best consumed within 2 or 3 hours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It is possible to store sake in the refrigerator, but it is recommended to finish the sake within 2 days.  This is because once premium sake is opened it begins to oxidize, which affects the taste.  If the sake is kept in the refrigerator for more than 3 days, it will lose its \"best\" flavor.  However, this does not mean it should be disposed of if not consumed.  Generally, sake can keep very well and still taste just fine after weeks in the refrigerator.  How long a sake will remain drinkable depends on the quality of the  product, and whether it is sealed with a vacuum top which removes air and helps decrease oxidation.\n\n==Ceremonial use==\n[[File:Sake before the kagami biraki.jpg|thumb|upright|A cask of sake before the [[kagami biraki]]]]\n[[File:SakeContainers.jpg|thumb|Decorative sake containers in a [[Nakatsugawa]] shop]]\nSake is often consumed as part of [[Shinto]] purification rituals. Sake served to gods as offerings prior to drinking are called {{nihongo|''o-miki''|[[wikt:\u5fa1\u795e\u9152#Japanese|\u5fa1\u795e\u9152]]}} or {{nihongo|''miki''|[[wikt:\u795e\u9152#Japanese|\u795e\u9152]]}}.\n\nIn a ceremony called ''[[kagami biraki]]'', wooden casks of sake are opened with mallets during Shinto festivals, weddings, store openings, sports and election victories, and other celebrations. This sake, called ''iwai-zake'' (\"celebration sake\"), is served freely to all to spread good fortune.\n\nAt the [[New Year]] many Japanese people drink a special sake called [[toso]].  Toso is a sort of iwai-zake made by soaking ''tososan'', a Chinese powdered medicine, overnight in sake. Even children sip a portion. In some regions, the first sips of toso are taken in order of age, from the youngest to the eldest.\n\n==Events==\n*October 1 is the official \"Sake Day\" ({{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u306e\u65e5}}, \"Nihonshu no Hi\") of Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=10\u67081\u65e5\u306e\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u9152\u306e\u65e5\u300d\u306b\u306f\u78ba\u304b\u306a\u6839\u62e0\u3042\u308a |url=http://www.sakejapan.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27 |publisher=Sake Service Institute |access-date=December 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116022441/http://www.sakejapan.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27 |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It is also called \"World Sake Day\".

[[Paul Shaffer]]  was the musical director. He first achieved fame as a cast member of the Canadian TV comedy series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', joining ''Godspell'' castmates Levy, Martin and later Short, plus [[Rick Moranis]], [[John Candy]], [[Harold Ramis]], [[Catherine O'Hara]] and others. Notable characters on the show include [[Bob and Doug McKenzie|Doug McKenzie]] of beer-swilling brothers [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]], editorialist ''Bill Needle'', Scottish scone-chef/bluesman ''Angus Crock'', motor-mouthed TV ad announcer ''Harvey K-Tel'', Lowery organist/curio pitchman ''Tex Boil'' and the unforgettable \"Cruising Gourmet\".\n\nThomas's first movie was ''[[Home to Stay]]'' directed by [[Delbert Mann]] where Thomas played in a scene with Hollywood legend [[Henry Fonda]]. He then wrote for, co-directed and starred in the Bob & Doug McKenzie feature film ''[[Strange Brew]]''.

In 1996, Thomas played the title role in the Fox TV movie ''Mr. Foster's Field Trip'' aka ''[[Kidz in the Wood (film)|Kidz in the Wood]]'' with [[Julia Duffy]]. In  1996, he wrote the book ''SCTV: Behind the Scenes'' ([[McClelland & Stewart]], publishers). From 1999-2002, he voiced various roles on the animated series ''[[Mission Hill (TV series)|Mission Hill]]''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} He also voiced Rex Banner in the Simpsons.\n\nThomas co-starred in the Paramount feature ''[[Rat Race (2001 film)|Rat Race]]''.

In 2005, he had a guest stint as [[Charlize Theron]]'s \"Uncle Trevor\" on Fox's ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]''. In 2006, he reprised his voice role in ''[[Brother Bear 2]]'' and appeared as himself in the feature film ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]''. He began production on ''ArnoldSpeaks.com'', a [[video blog]], as the voice of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]; Animax Entertainment won an Emmy for a broadband animated series produced for ESPN, ''Off Mikes''.\n\nIn 2007, Thomas and [[Rick Moranis]] reprised their roles as Bob and Doug McKenzie in a one-hour special \"[[Bob & Doug McKenzie's Two-Four Anniversary]]\" for CBC Television. The show featured cameos from McKenzie celeb fans like [[Ben Stiller]], [[Dave Foley]], [[Tom Green]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[Andy Dick]], [[Matt Groening]], [[Barry Pepper]], [[Martin Short]], and [[Geddy Lee]]. Former Prime Minister of Canada [[Paul Martin]] was the host. In 2008, Thomas revived Bob and Doug McKenzie in a new animated series, ''[[Bob & Doug (2009 TV series)|Bob & Doug]]''. While Thomas reprises the character of Doug in the new series, Moranis chose not to voice the character of Bob, which instead is voiced by [[Dave Coulier]]. Moranis is, however, involved in the series as an executive producer.<ref name=star>Rob Salem, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Television/article/620381 \"Bob & Doug taking off again\"].
