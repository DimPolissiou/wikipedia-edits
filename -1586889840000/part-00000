Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n'''Section 5.''' The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |title=Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11\u201327 |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526170111/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |url-status=live  }}</ref>}}\n\n==Adoption==\n===Proposal by Congress===\n{{see also|Presidency of Andrew Johnson}}\n\nIn the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866.

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so\u2014something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/>\n\n===Enforcement===\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title=\"An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census\", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6.

The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.'''

Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so\u2014something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/>\n\n===Enforcement===\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title=\"An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census\", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6.

With the ability to control one's actions, a Straight edge participant would be better suited to stand up against the mainstream. The first wave of straight edge did not impose rules on others, rather participants chose to follow the ways of self-control. With the second wave of straight edge these rules were used to control others. In addition the second wave experienced a change in music style. Where the first wave was influenced by hardcore punk, the second wave brought in aspects of [[heavy metal music]] which further pushed for power and control over others. The slowing down of the music reflected the focus of individuals in their journey to self control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsos|first=William|date=1999|title=Rules of Rebellion: Slamdancing, Moshing, and the American Alternative Scene|url=|journal=Popular Music|volume=18|issue=3|pages=397\u2013414|doi=10.1017/S0261143000008941}}</ref>\n\n== X symbol ==\n[[File:ToKill2-stillarbeit.de.jpg|thumb|Italian straight edge band To Kill performing at a club]]\nThe letter X is the most known symbol of straight edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins. According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X can be traced to the [[Teen Idles]]' brief West Coast tour in 1980.<ref name=\"mazerrad\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=127}}</ref> The band's members were scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Mabuhay Gardens]], but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' hands with a large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band.\n\nUpon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol.<ref name=\"mazerrad\" /> The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called ''[[Minor Disturbance]]'' with the cover shot being two hands with black Xs on the back.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Punk\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=132}}</ref> The mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Punk\" /> It can also be used by [[drinking establishment]]s to note a patron as under the drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs such as alcohol.\n\nLater bands used the X symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia in a variety of ways.

During this period, the straight edge scene birthed two major offshoots: the more [[conservative]] [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]]<ref name=\"Wood (1999) p. 140\">{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref> and the religiously influenced [[Hare Krishna in popular culture#Straight Edge subculture|Krishna Consciousness]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|1999|pp=143\u201346}}</ref> While the majority of straight edge punks and Hare Krishna converts were pacifists, those influenced by hardline showed a willingness to resort to violence in order to promote their subculture.<ref name=\"haenfler88\">{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p=88}}</ref> Musically, the straight edge scene was increasingly drawing from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and was a founding influence on [[metalcore]].\n\n====Outside the United States====\n[[File:Xponrx.jpg|thumb|left|140px|The Brazilian vegan straight edge band [[Point of No Return (band)|Point of No Return]] in 2006.]]\nIn the late 1980s a vegetarian straight edge scene emerged in [[Durham, England]]. Heavily inspired by the sound of U.S. youth crew and straight edge bands, groups in the scene included Steadfast, False Face, No Way Out, Long Cold Stare, Know Your Enemy, The MacDonalds and Northern Wolfpack.<ref>{{cite AV media|date=1989 |title= UK Straight Edge}}</ref> Members of multiple of these bands would eventually form [[Voorhees (band)|Voorhees]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Voorhees \"What You See Is What You Get\" 7\" |url=http://socialnapalm.limitedrun.com/products/625163-voorhees-what-you-see-is-what-you-get-7 |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, straight edge spread from the United States to Northern Europe,<ref name=\"Kuhn 2010 121\"/> Eastern Europe,<ref name=\"Kuhn 2010 132\"/> the Middle East,<ref name=\"Kuhn 2010 112\"/> and South America.<ref name=\"Kuhn 2010 66\"/> It grew around the world due to the relentless touring of youth crew bands and the ease of ordering records from American record labels via mail.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|pp=50\u201352}}</ref> [[Fluff Fest]], which has been held in the Czech Republic since 2000 and draws audiences from across Europe, is linked to straight edge through its organizers and showcases prominent straight edge bands.<ref name=\"Kuhn 137\">{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=137}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD BANDS THAT HAVE ONE OR TWO MEMBERS WHO ARE EDGE! -->\n[[File:HAVE HEARTFinalTour,TheOnlyFloridaDate.jpg|thumb|right|Boston straight edge band Have Heart's 2019 reunion show outside the [[Worcester Palladium]] had the highest attendance of any hardcore show in history<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bastias |first1=Steven |title=HAVE HEART\u2019S REUNION WAS THE BIGGEST HARDCORE SHOW EVER |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/have-hearts-reunion-show-was-the-biggest-hardcore-show-ever/ |website=[[Kerrang!]] |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref>]]\nBy the beginning of the 2000s, only small groups of militant straight edge individuals remained.<ref name=\"Haenfler (2006)\"/> Contrary to news reports that portrayed straight edge as a gang,<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2003|pp= 45}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p= 91}}</ref> several studies have shown that straight edge individuals as a whole are mostly peaceful people.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2003|p= 46}}</ref> In the 2000s, there was a growing amount of tolerance of people who do not follow the straight edge lifestyle by straight edge individuals.<ref>{{harvnb|Wood|2003|pp= 46\u201347}}</ref> In this incarnation of straight edge, the musical styles of the bands involved are more varied, ranging from a youth crew revival style to [[metalcore]] to [[posicore]].<ref name=\"Haenfler (2006)\" /> Straight edge bands from the 2000s include [[Champion (band)|Champion]], [[Down to Nothing]], [[Embrace Today]], [[Have Heart]], and [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]].<ref>{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|p= 219}}</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\nIn the early stages of straight edge, its philosophy was to rebel through self-control. With the ability to control one's actions, a Straight edge participant would be better suited to stand up against the mainstream. The first wave of straight edge did not impose rules on others, rather participants chose to follow the ways of self-control. With the second wave of straight edge these rules were used to control others. In addition the second wave experienced a change in music style. Where the first wave was influenced by hardcore punk, the second wave brought in aspects of [[heavy metal music]] which further pushed for power and control over others. The slowing down of the music reflected the focus of individuals in their journey to self control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsitsos|first=William|date=1999|title=Rules of Rebellion: Slamdancing, Moshing, and the American Alternative Scene|url=|journal=Popular Music|volume=18|issue=3|pages=397\u2013414|doi=10.1017/S0261143000008941}}</ref>\n\n== X symbol ==\n[[File:ToKill2-stillarbeit.de.jpg|thumb|Italian straight edge band To Kill performing at a club]]\nThe letter X is the most known symbol of straight edge, and is sometimes worn as a marking on the back of both hands, though it can be displayed on other body parts as well. Some followers of straight edge have also incorporated the symbol into clothing and pins. According to a series of interviews by journalist Michael Azerrad, the straight edge X can be traced to the [[Teen Idles]]' brief West Coast tour in 1980.<ref name=\"mazerrad\">{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=127}}</ref> The band's members were scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Mabuhay Gardens]], but when they arrived, club management discovered that they were all under the legal drinking age and would be denied entry to the club. As a compromise, management marked each of the members' hands with a large black X as a warning to the club's staff not to serve alcohol to the band.\n\nUpon returning to Washington, D.C., the band suggested this same system to local clubs as a means to allow teenagers in to see musical performances without being served alcohol.<ref name=\"mazerrad\" /> The Teen Idles released a record in 1980 called ''[[Minor Disturbance]]'' with the cover shot being two hands with black Xs on the back.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Punk\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|2001|p=132}}</ref> The mark soon became associated with the straight edge lifestyle.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Punk\" /> It can also be used by [[drinking establishment]]s to note a patron as under the drinking age, regardless of their views towards drugs such as alcohol.\n\nLater bands used the X symbol on album covers and other paraphernalia in a variety of ways. The cover of ''No Apologies'' by [[Judge (band)|Judge]] shows two crossed [[gavel]]s in the X formation.<ref name=\"Wood 2006 p.119\">{{harvnb|Wood|2006|p=119}}</ref> Other objects that have been used include shovels, baseball bats, and hockey sticks.<ref name=\"Wood 2006 p.119\" /> A variation involving a trio of Xs is often used in flyers and tattoos. It can also be ironic, based on the fact that three Xs was popularized in cartoons and television shows to signify alcohol or poison. [[Moonshine]]rs used an X to note how many times a particular batch of moonshine ran through the still, adding irony.<ref name=\"Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge.\">{{harvnb|Helton|Staudenmeier|2002|p=445}}</ref> The term is sometimes abbreviated by including an X with the abbreviation of the term \"straight edge\" to give \"sXe\".<ref>{{harvnb|Haenfler|2006|pp=4}}</ref> By analogy, hardcore punk is sometimes abbreviated to \"hXc\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hannon|2010|pp=162}}</ref>\n\n== Approaches ==\nWhile some straight edge groups are treated as a \"[[gang]]\" by law enforcement officials,<ref name=\"national geographic special2\">{{Cite episode|title=Inside Straight Edge|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/episodes/inside-straight-edge/|accessdate=1 January 2013|series=Inside|network=National Geographic Society|season=|seriesno=|number=|minutes=50|transcript=|quote=|language=|episodelink=|serieslink=|credits=Writer: David Shadrack Smith.

edge.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuhn|2010|p=14}}</ref>\n\n== Veganism ==\nBy the late 1990s, many straight edge participants gave [[veganism]] the same degree of importance as abstinence from intoxicants, and some

In the series, Howard is portrayed as cocky, arrogant and self-centered. However, many fans of the show believe that Howard is actually a good person. Fabian commented by saying \"You know, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy [McGill]]] called Howard '[[Darth Vader|Lord Vader]]' in the very first episode of ''Better Call Saul''. And when the lead character calls your character Lord Vader, the audience goes, 'Wow, what a dick that guy's gonna be.' Then everybody starts looking at everything that falls out of my mouth as evidence backing that claim up. And even when it goes in the opposite direction -- like at the end of Season 1, where it turns out I was sort of protecting Jimmy from [[Chuck McGill|Chuck [McGill]]], there is a bit of a hitch of 'Oh, maybe Howard's not so bad,' but as soon as I was quote-unquote being a dick to [[Kim Wexler|Kim [Wexler]]] in Season 2, they all got back on board and said, 'Yeah, he's Lord Vader.' I'm not complaining at all. It sort of parallels Howard's character in the show. Who's really supporting his point of view? Nobody. He's kind of on an island all to himself, saying 'This is not fair. This is not right. And it's also not my fault.' We'll see where those chickens come home to roost, as they say.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1670090/why-better-call-sauls-howard-isnt-really-a-villain-according-to-patrick-fabian |title=Why Better Call Saul's Howard Isn't Really A Villain, According To Patrick Fabian |date=June 14, 2017 |website=Cinema Blend |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319214541/https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1670090/why-better-call-sauls-howard-isnt-really-a-villain-according-to-patrick-fabian |archive-date=March 19, 2020 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/is-better-call-saul-s-howard-hamlin-a-dick-or-not-1798163576 |title=Is Better Call Saul's Howard Hamlin a dick or not? |last=Teti |first=John |date=April 6, 2016 |website=[[The A.V.

The firm was originally established by Howard's father George and Chuck McGill, who later added Howard as a partner. When George died and Chuck became housebound as a result of his supposed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], Howard became the firm's managing partner.\n\nWhen Chuck brings his younger brother Jimmy from Chicago to turn him away from his conman past, Howard agrees to employ Jimmy in HHM's mail room. Jimmy becomes impressed with Chuck's legal work as well as that of Kim Wexler, a law student who also works in the mail room, leading Jimmy to get his own law degree through correspondence school. After Jimmy passes the bar exam, Chuck secretly instructs Howard to deny him advancement at HHM. Unaware of Chuck's machinations, Jimmy becomes resentful towards Howard and starts his own moderately successful practice.\n\nWith Chuck unable to leave his house, Howard attempts to buy out his share of the partnership with a token payment. As Chuck's caregiver and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Jimmy refuses and demands that if Howard buys Chuck out, he pay the full value.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nJimmy accepts a bribe from the Kettlemans, a married couple accused of embezzlement.  He spends the money on a personal appearance and wardrobe makeover and a billboard advertisement, both of which copy the signature looks of Howard and HHM. Howard persuades Kim to confront Jimmy over the imitation, but Jimmy refuses to stop.  Howard sues Jimmy for [[trademark infringement]], and Jimmy is ordered to have the advertisement removed within 48 hours, but uses the opportunity to stage a phony rescue of the billboard worker, which generates favorable publicity for Jimmy's law practice. \n\nWhen Jimmy delivers Chuck's newspapers the next day, he removes the local one so that Chuck will not see the story about the billboard rescue. Chuck braves the outdoors to take his neighbor's paper and sees the story about Jimmy's trick. The neighbor calls police, who break into Chuck's home and use a taser to subdue him. Chuck is rushed to the hospital, where the doctor tells Jimmy that Chuck's illness and recommends he be [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to a mental institution. Howard arrives and tells Jimmy the district attorney has agreed to drop the charges and allow Chuck to return home. Jimmy believes Howard does not want Chuck to be hospitalized so that Howard can continue attempting to buy out his partnership. Jimmy angrily tells Howard he intends to have Chuck committed, but tells Kim he said it only to irritate Howard.\n\nThe media attention from Jimmy's staged rescue causes him to start an elder law practice. When he uncovers possible fraud at the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, Chuck helps him confirm the details. Jimmy and Chuck initiate a class-action suit, which becomes too large for them to handle alone, so Chuck suggests taking the case to HHM. Howard arranges for a meeting with Jimmy and Chuck at HHM and takes steps to accommodate Chuck's EHS. When Chuck arrives, the entire staff gives him a standing ovation. HHM agrees to take the case and Howard offers Jimmy twenty percent of the final judgment or settlement and an [[of counsel]] fee of $20,000, but makes clear that Jimmy will not continue to participate in the case.  Jimmy demands to know why Howard has always excluded him. Howard does not provide satisfactory answers, so Jimmy angrily refuses to hand off the case.\n\nKim confronts Howard about his treatment of Jimmy. Howard is initially resistant, but then tells Kim the truth -- that Chuck secretly asked him to block Jimmy. Jimmy figures out on his own that Chuck was responsible. He gives HHM the Sandpiper case, disengages from daily interaction with Chuck, and obtains Howard's agreement to continue Chuck's care. After seeing Jimmy's routine for himself, Howard is impressed with the time and effort Jimmy has put in and assigns Ernesto, an HHM employee, to continue caring for Chuck.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nHHM finds that Jimmy and Chuck's assessment that Sandpiper has engaged in fraud across several states is correct. With the case becoming too big for HHM, Howard brings in another firm, Davis & Main (D&M).  Kim vouches for Jimmy to managing partner Clifford Main, and the D&M partners are impressed with Jimmy's knowledge of the case and rapport with clients, so they hire him as an associate. With responsibility for client outreach, Jimmy bypasses both Howard's and Clifford's oversight to attract more plaintiffs, including a melodramatic television commercial he produces himself and airs without approval. Howard, Clifford, and Chuck reprimand Jimmy, and Howard relegates Kim to entry-level document review work for failing to warn them. Jimmy quits D&M, while Kim attempts to regain her status by working her contacts to obtain a new client for HHM. She succeeds with Mesa Verde Bank, a local bank that is planning a multi-state expansion. Howard is happy to nhave the nbusiness, but denies Kim credit and keeps her working in document review. When Jimmy proposes they start a partnership, Kim counters with an offer to establish separate practices in a shared office. Jimmy accepts, so Kim quits HHM.\n\nHoward and Kim each work to obtain Mesa Verde as a client. The bank's president and legal counsel, Kevin and Paige, initially agree to hire Kim. Howard and Chuck meet with Kevin and Paige, and Chuck's damning of Kim with faint praise causes them to change their mind and retain HHM. When Chuck breaks down from the stress of appearing \"normal\" while meeting with Kevin and Paige, Jimmy tells Ernesto he will stay overnight with Chuck. Jimmy uses the opportunity to alter several documents in an application for a new Mesa Verde branch. At the next meeting of the banking board, the errors are uncovered. With Mesa Verde facing a loss of time and money because of the incorrect documents, Kevin and Paige leave HHM and retain Kim. \n\nChuck immediately suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him and works to prove it. He feigns a severe breakdown, which causes Jimmy to confess to his deceit. Unknown to Jimmy, Chuck recorded his confession.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck reveals Jimmy's confession to Howard, who wonders what Chuck can do with it, since it cannot be used in court. Chuck tells Howard the recording has a use. He first arranges for Ernesto to overhear a portion of the confession, then swears him to silence. Ernesto informs Kim about the recording, and Kim tells Jimmy. Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house and destroys the tape. Howard and a private investigator Chuck hired reveal themselves and tell Jimmy they are witnesses to his crimes, enabling Chuck to report Jimmy to the police. The prosecutor assigned to the case asures Chuck she takes the charges seriously and will press for jail time, but Chuck offers to drop the charges if Jimmy faces a bar association disciplinary hearing, which will likely result in disbarment. Jimmy agrees, but Kim and he plan a defense. At the hearing, Jimmy's cross-examination and revalation of Chuck's symptoms as psychosomatic causes Chuck to break down again. Jimmy law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. Howard tries to cheer up Chuck and tells himt hey should consider the suspension a victory, but Chuck becomes even more withdrawn.\n\nAs a cost-cutting move, Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund on his malpractice insurance premium. Informed that the policy has to stay in effect in case he is sued during his suspension, Jimmy feigns worry over Chuck's condition, but his knowing smile as he leaves indicates he is aware he has caused a problem for Chuck. Insurance company representatives inform Howard and Chuck that because of Chuck's condition, he will need to be constantly supervised by another attorney or HHM will face a steep increase in its premium. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard uses personal funds and loans to raise the first of three $3 million payments that will enable him to buy Chuck out. Chuck is forced to retire, and becomes even more reclusive. Jimmy tries to see Chuck and make amends, but Chuck tells Jimmy that Jimmy was never that important to him. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck angrily kicks a table several times, purposely knocking over a camping lantern and starting a fire.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nChuck dies in the fire. Howard is his emergency contact, and after police notify him, Howard notifies Jimmy and Kim.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/howards-reaction-to-chucks-death-is-crucial-to-better-call-saul-season-4-according-to-patrick-fabian-9999928 |title=How That Shocking \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Death Will Twist Relationships In Season 4 |last=Gallagher |first=Caitlin |date=August 6, 2018 |website=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510152239/https://www.bustle.com/p/howards-reaction-to-chucks-death-is-crucial-to-better-call-saul-season-4-according-to-patrick-fabian-9999928 |archive-date=May 10, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> Over the following week, Howard crafts an obituary and invites Chuck's friends and colleagues to a memorial service. Afterward, he confesses to Jimmy and Kim that he may be responsible for Chuck's death because he forced Chuck to retire after the increase in HHM's malpractice insurance premium. Relieved that someone else is taking responsibility, Jimmy continues to conceal his role in causing the insurance premium to go up and regains his usual upbeat demeanor. Howard is burdened with guilt and HHM suffers from his inattention, the financial strain of paying out to Chuck's estate, and the loss of clients resulting from the firm's damaged reputation.  As it becomes clear that Howard is floundering, Jimmy tries a \"tough love\" pep talk to rouse him to action. A year after Chuck's death, Howard gives a speech at the dedication for a new law library reading room in Chuck's honor, in which he indicates that HHM has recovered its financial footing and standing in Albuquerque's legal community.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nHoward encounters Jimmy at the courthouse, now practicing under the name Saul Goodman. Howard informs Jimmy that Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill's recovery is still strong, and that the firm has been restored to profitability.  He invites Jimmy to lunch, where he apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy is visibly unsettled by the reminder of his past. He begins to harass Howard, including using bowling balls to vandalize Howard's expensive car and prostitutes to disrupt Howard's business lunch with Clifford Main. Howard realizes that Jimmy is behind the harassment and rescinds the job offer. Jimmy lashes out at Howard, blaming him for Chuck's death and claiming that as Saul Goodman, he has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Better Call Saul}}\n\n[[Category:Better Call Saul characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional American lawyers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2015]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #133E51\n| name               = Howard Hamlin\n| series             = [[Better Call Saul]]\n| image              = HowardHamlinBCS.jpg\n| caption            = [[Patrick Fabian]] as Howard Hamlin in a promotional poster for [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|''Better Call Saul''{{'}}s fourth season]].\n| first              = \"[[Uno (Better Call Saul)|Uno]]\" (2015)\n| last               = \n| creator            = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Vince Gilligan]]\n* [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]]\n}}\n| portrayer          = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Patrick Fabian]]\n}}\n| full_name          = \n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Lawyer|Attorney]]\n* [[Criminal defense lawyer|Criminal lawyer]]\n* CEO of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill\n}}\n| family             = George M.

In the series, Howard is portrayed as cocky, arrogant and self-centered. However, many fans of the show believe that Howard is actually a good person. Fabian commented by saying \"You know, [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy [McGill]]] called Howard '[[Darth Vader|Lord Vader]]' in the very first episode of ''Better Call Saul''. And when the lead character calls your character Lord Vader, the audience goes, 'Wow, what a dick that guy's gonna be.' Then everybody starts looking at everything that falls out of my mouth as evidence backing that claim up. And even when it goes in the opposite direction -- like at the end of Season 1, where it turns out I was sort of protecting Jimmy from [[Chuck McGill|Chuck [McGill]]], there is a bit of a hitch of 'Oh, maybe Howard's not so bad,' but as soon as I was quote-unquote being a dick to [[Kim Wexler|Kim [Wexler]]] in Season 2, they all got back on board and said, 'Yeah, he's Lord Vader.' I'm not complaining at all. It sort of parallels Howard's character in the show. Who's really supporting his point of view? Nobody. He's kind of on an island all to himself, saying 'This is not fair. This is not right. And it's also not my fault.'

The firm was originally established by Howard's father George and Chuck McGill, who later added Howard as a partner. When George died and Chuck became housebound as a result of his supposed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], Howard became the firm's managing partner.\n\nWhen Chuck brings his younger brother Jimmy from Chicago to turn him away from his conman past, Howard agrees to employ Jimmy in HHM's mail room. Jimmy becomes impressed with Chuck's legal work as well as that of Kim Wexler, a law student who also works in the mail room, leading Jimmy to get his own law degree through correspondence school. After Jimmy passes the bar exam, Chuck secretly instructs Howard to deny him advancement at HHM. Unaware of Chuck's machinations, Jimmy becomes resentful towards Howard and starts his own moderately successful practice.\n\nWith Chuck unable to leave his house, Howard attempts to buy out his share of the partnership with a token payment. As Chuck's caregiver and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Jimmy refuses and demands that if Howard buys Chuck out, he pay the full value.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nJimmy accepts a bribe from the Kettlemans, a married couple accused of embezzlement.  He spends the money on a personal appearance and wardrobe makeover and a billboard advertisement, both of which copy the signature looks of Howard and HHM. Howard persuades Kim to confront Jimmy over the imitation, but Jimmy refuses to stop.  Howard sues Jimmy for [[trademark infringement]], and Jimmy is ordered to have the advertisement removed within 48 hours, but uses the opportunity to stage a phony rescue of the billboard worker, which generates favorable publicity for Jimmy's law practice. \n\nWhen Jimmy delivers Chuck's newspapers the next day, he removes the local one so that Chuck will not see the story about the billboard rescue. Chuck braves the outdoors to take his neighbor's paper and sees the story about Jimmy's trick. The neighbor calls police, who break into Chuck's home and use a taser to subdue him. Chuck is rushed to the hospital, where the doctor tells Jimmy that Chuck's illness and recommends he be [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to a mental institution. Howard arrives and tells Jimmy the district attorney has agreed to drop the charges and allow Chuck to return home. Jimmy believes Howard does not want Chuck to be hospitalized so that Howard can continue attempting to buy out his partnership. Jimmy angrily tells Howard he intends to have Chuck committed, but tells Kim he said it only to irritate Howard.\n\nThe media attention from Jimmy's staged rescue causes him to start an elder law practice. When he uncovers possible fraud at the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, Chuck helps him confirm the details. Jimmy and Chuck initiate a class-action suit, which becomes too large for them to handle alone, so Chuck suggests taking the case to HHM. Howard arranges for a meeting with Jimmy and Chuck at HHM and takes steps to accommodate Chuck's EHS. When Chuck arrives, the entire staff gives him a standing ovation. HHM agrees to take the case and Howard offers Jimmy twenty percent of the final judgment or settlement and an [[of counsel]] fee of $20,000, but makes clear that Jimmy will not continue to participate in the case.  Jimmy demands to know why Howard has always excluded him. Howard does not provide satisfactory answers, so Jimmy angrily refuses to hand off the case.\n\nKim confronts Howard about his treatment of Jimmy. Howard is initially resistant, but then tells Kim the truth -- that Chuck secretly asked him to block Jimmy. Jimmy figures out on his own that Chuck was responsible. He gives HHM the Sandpiper case, disengages from daily interaction with Chuck, and obtains Howard's agreement to continue Chuck's care. After seeing Jimmy's routine for himself, Howard is impressed with the time and effort Jimmy has put in and assigns Ernesto, an HHM employee, to continue caring for Chuck.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nHHM finds that Jimmy and Chuck's assessment that Sandpiper has engaged in fraud across several states is correct. With the case becoming too big for HHM, Howard brings in another firm, Davis & Main (D&M).  Kim vouches for Jimmy to managing partner Clifford Main, and the D&M partners are impressed with Jimmy's knowledge of the case and rapport with clients, so they hire him as an associate. With responsibility for client outreach, Jimmy bypasses both Howard's and Clifford's oversight to attract more plaintiffs, including a melodramatic television commercial he produces himself and airs without approval. Howard, Clifford, and Chuck reprimand Jimmy, and Howard relegates Kim to entry-level document review work for failing to warn them. Jimmy quits D&M, while Kim attempts to regain her status by working her contacts to obtain a new client for HHM. She succeeds with Mesa Verde Bank, a local bank that is planning a multi-state expansion. Howard is happy to nhave the nbusiness, but denies Kim credit and keeps her working in document review. When Jimmy proposes they start a partnership, Kim counters with an offer to establish separate practices in a shared office. Jimmy accepts, so Kim quits HHM.\n\nHoward and Kim each work to obtain Mesa Verde as a client. The bank's president and legal counsel, Kevin and Paige, initially agree to hire Kim. Howard and Chuck meet with Kevin and Paige, and Chuck's damning of Kim with faint praise causes them to change their mind and retain HHM. When Chuck breaks down from the stress of appearing \"normal\" while meeting with Kevin and Paige, Jimmy tells Ernesto he will stay overnight with Chuck. Jimmy uses the opportunity to alter several documents in an application for a new Mesa Verde branch. At the next meeting of the banking board, the errors are uncovered. With Mesa Verde facing a loss of time and money because of the incorrect documents, Kevin and Paige leave HHM and retain Kim. \n\nChuck immediately suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him and works to prove it. He feigns a severe breakdown, which causes Jimmy to confess to his deceit. Unknown to Jimmy, Chuck recorded his confession.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck reveals Jimmy's confession to Howard, who wonders what Chuck can do with it, since it cannot be used in court. Chuck tells Howard the recording has a use. He first arranges for Ernesto to overhear a portion of the confession, then swears him to silence. Ernesto informs Kim about the recording, and Kim tells Jimmy. Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house and destroys the tape. Howard and a private investigator Chuck hired reveal themselves and tell Jimmy they are witnesses to his crimes, enabling Chuck to report Jimmy to the police. The prosecutor assigned to the case asures Chuck she takes the charges seriously and will press for jail time, but Chuck offers to drop the charges if Jimmy faces a bar association disciplinary hearing, which will likely result in disbarment. Jimmy agrees, but Kim and he plan a defense. At the hearing, Jimmy's cross-examination and revalation of Chuck's symptoms as psychosomatic causes Chuck to break down again. Jimmy law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. Howard tries to cheer up Chuck and tells himt hey should consider the suspension a victory, but Chuck becomes even more withdrawn.\n\nAs a cost-cutting move, Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund on his malpractice insurance premium. Informed that the policy has to stay in effect in case he is sued during his suspension, Jimmy feigns worry over Chuck's condition, but his knowing smile as he leaves indicates he is aware he has caused a problem for Chuck. Insurance company representatives inform Howard and Chuck that because of Chuck's condition, he will need to be constantly supervised by another attorney or HHM will face a steep increase in its premium. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard uses personal funds and loans to raise the first of three $3 million payments that will enable him to buy Chuck out. Chuck is forced to retire, and becomes even more reclusive. Jimmy tries to see Chuck and make amends, but Chuck tells Jimmy that Jimmy was never that important to him. After Jimmy leaves, Chuck angrily kicks a table several times, purposely knocking over a camping lantern and starting a fire.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nChuck dies in the fire.

Over the following week, Howard crafts an obituary and invites Chuck's friends and colleagues to a memorial service. Afterward, he confesses to Jimmy and Kim that he may be responsible for Chuck's death because he forced Chuck to retire after the increase in HHM's malpractice insurance rate.  Relieved that someone else is taking responsibility, Jimmy continues to conceal his role in causing the insurance premium to go up and regains his usual upbeat demeanor. Howard is burdened with guilt and HHM begins to fall apart from a combination of his inattention to his work, the financial strain of paying out to Chuck's estate, and the loss of clients resulting from the firm's damaged reputation.  As it becomes clear that Howard has no solution, Jimmy tries a \"tough love\" pep talk.

Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest Festival]], he was signed to [[Aware Records]], and then [[Columbia Records]], which released his first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''. His following two full-length albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014did well commercially, achieving [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] status. In 2003, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\".\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the [[blues]] and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released a live album in 2005 called ''[[Try!]]'', and his third studio album ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' in 2006. Both albums received critical acclaim, and ''Continuum'' earned Mayer a [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. He also won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\". That album was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' in 2009, a return to pop, with a [[Battle Studies World Tour]].\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'', which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]]. However, the discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'', which incorporates [[country music]] influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://music.yahoo.com/photos/top-new-acts-since-2000-1403561474-slideshow/| title=USA: Top 20 New Acts Since 2000| website=Yahoo!

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \" [[Truckin']].\" Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Quote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with John-boy and chase the music around, get to know each other. When that dream came to me, it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved, musically speaking \u2013 being able to intuit the songs.

Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 [[South by Southwest Festival]], he was signed to [[Aware Records]], and then [[Columbia Records]], which released his first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Inside Wants Out]]''. His following two full-length albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014did well commercially, achieving [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]] status. In 2003, he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\".\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the [[blues]] and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as [[B. B. King]], [[Buddy Guy]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released a live album in 2005 called ''[[Try!]]'', and his third studio album ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' in 2006. Both albums received critical acclaim, and ''Continuum'' earned Mayer a [[49th Annual Grammy Awards|2007]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. He also won [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\". That album was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' in 2009, a return to pop, with a [[Battle Studies World Tour]].\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'', which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]]. However, the discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'', which incorporates [[country music]] influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://music.yahoo.com/photos/top-new-acts-since-2000-1403561474-slideshow/| title=USA: Top 20 New Acts Since 2000| website=Yahoo!

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \" [[Truckin']].\" Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Quote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time.
