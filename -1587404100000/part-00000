It airs between 4:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=YTV Shows: The Zone|url=https://www.ytv.com/shows/the-zone|website=YTV.com|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> On Saturday mornings, it is called '''''The Zone Weekend''''' (formerly ''[[Crunch (TV programming block)|Crunch]]'').\n\n==Current version==\nCurrently, the hosts of ''The Zone'' are [[Jason Agnew]], Spencer Litzinger, and Tyra Sweet.\n\nThe program usually features the hosts and the addition of one guest host. The \"guest host\" is sometimes an inanimate or personified object that is spoken to by Nayan Patel. Some examples would be \"The Hand in the Toilet\" (the toilet was embedded in the wall; a hand came out the hole once in a while) and \"The Camera Man\".\n\nAnother voice on the show was Egghead (the director Greg Dickinson, who worked on ''The Zone'' from 1993-2008)  Egghead's face was never seen. He also appeared several times as \"the guy in the gorilla suit\".\n\nIn its early history, the Zone had featured a group of [[puppet]]s known as ''Grogs'' as the co-hosts. A large television with a frame resembling a piece of purple [[bubble gum]] with eyes and other mechanical miscellany called Snit (Atul N.

Similar programming existed on YTV's weekend morning broadcasts, also starring variety of hosts, labeled \"PJs\", or program jockeys, as a take on [[Disc jockey|DJ]] (disc jockey) and [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] (video jockey). This was done primarily as a tactic to comply with [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] restrictions on advertising in children's programming: popular imported programming would run a few minutes short due to fewer ads being permitted compared to US stations. Instead of filling the time with [[public service announcement]]s or other filler material (which had been the previous practice of YTV in the late 1980s/early 1990s), the idea of devoting several minutes between programs to interaction between live-action hosts was used, and has proven successful to this day.\n\nThe \"Afterschool\" portion of the title was soon dropped and PJ \"Phresh\" Phil was sometimes joined by another PJ, Jenn (although she featured more prominently during weekend morning programming and was rarely on The Zone). The segments usually involved discussion or banter on various topics, video clips, previews, and viewer mail.\n\nEventually, the PJs were joined by a variety of puppets named the [[Grogs (YTV)|Grogs]] and Spitfire. 1994 saw the introduction of animatronic character Snit (Atul N. Rao), which displayed a pair of moving teeth on a television screen covered with what appeared to be purple [[bubble gum]]. When a primetime version of The Zone, ''YTV Shift'', was cancelled, its former host [[Paul McGuire (television host)|Paul McGuire]] joined Phil. On October 31, 1997, the two sent Snit into space, and Snit was replaced with the prop Elvays, a plastic Elvis head with a digitally added moving mouth.\n\nEventually, a week of programming was devoted to a plotline which featured PJs Phil and Paul on a quest hunting for [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] and making a discovery. This discovery was revealed to be the return of the Snit character (minus its familiar purple coloring). Following cosmetic and technological upgrades, Snit went on to host ''Snit Station'', a weekend morning programming block, replacing ''Brainwash''; the block was later renamed ''The Vortex'', before it was renamed ''CRUNCH''.\n\nA female co-host, Sandra Jackson, was added to the Zone in 1999. She began hosting alongside Paul and Phil.\n\nAs a slight format change, the \"You Rule!\" campaign was replaced with a \"Keep it Weird!\" theme. When the New Year came, Sandra, Paul, and Phil were found to not be \"Y2K Compatible\", venturing into other opportunities and were thus replaced with comedian Pat Kelly and Jenny Katie Racicot (previously PJ Katie on [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], with no relation to the original PJ Jenn or PJ Jazzy Jan) Elvays was replaced with \"the Hand in the Toilet\".\n\nWhile Jenny and Pat were hosts, they formed the band \"Nuclear Donkey\", which was featured at the end of the YTV's compilation album ''Big Fun Party Mix''.\n\nAt one point during their tenure, a bizarre plotline emerged involving electronic insects known as Yokomites that were under the control of a mysterious chicken-man named Fiendly Fowl. They were created by Fowl to destroy the station, should his demand to be given the station was ignored. At the end, there was an animated comic where Pat and Jenny went into the Yokomites' lair to defeat them. The hand in the toilet was \"killed\" when it saved them.\n\nWith Jenny's departure, Pat had a brief breakdown as a one-week plotline, where he demanded a new co-host or he would no longer host. He built a giant wooden crate in the studio parking lot and locked himself inside it as a protest until YTV hired a new co-host. At the end of the week [[Sugar Lyn Beard|Sugar Beard]] came along claiming to be Pat's new co-host and she opened the crate with a crowbar to reveal a disheveled Pat who was in desperate need of a shower. The two co-hosted the block afterwards. However, Pat himself soon also departed, leaving Sugar as the lone host. A plotline emerged where Sugar would discover that one of the YTV's janitors was playing with the cameras during off-hours, clandestinely acting out as a host for ''The Zone''. Employing detective skills to track down this janitor, Sugar eventually discovered Carlos and invited him to become her co-host.\n\nSugar and Carlos hosted together for several years, introducing such segments as \"A Dash of Sugar\" and \"Late Afternoon With Tito Lemmy\", along with many characters such as Van Vogel, Pretty Tiffany, Johnny \"The Brick\" Wahl, and Wiwyam Birdie. They also co-wrote six songs together as the band \"Nuclear Donkey\".\n\nOn January 19, 2007, Sugar announced on that she would leave ''The Zone'' on January 26, 2007. Sugar's last \"Nuclear Donkey\" song appeared on ''Big Fun Party Mix 8'', a compilation from YTV. Carlos hosted ''The Zone'' alone until Monday, December 31, 2007, on ''The Zone'''s Countdown to Halfway to New Year's party, where he introduced his new co-host, Joyce. She had recently appeared on ''The Zone'' working at the Tree Farm, where Carlos chose ''The Zone''s Christmas Tree. Joyce co-hosted until January 2, 2009, when she left to travel the world. In fall 2009, ''The Zone'' returned to starting at 3:00 p.m. instead of 4:00 p.m.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, ''The Zone'' began doing the 4@4 lineup featuring four back-to-back episodes of ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' on Mondays and Wednesdays, ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' on Fridays. ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'' was formerly on the block as well. On July 5, 2013, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' was added to the block; encore presentations of the episodes which air on Saturdays at 5:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.\n\nOn August 26, 2013, ''The Zone'''s lineup returned to the way it was the previous year.\n\nIn October 2013, two new hosts were announced, ''The Next Star'''s Mark \"Suki\" Suknanan and TFC's Rachel Bonnetta. Suki is responsible for all things celebrities and Rachel talks about the latest trends. These are the first two new cast members since Andrew Chapman.\n\nOn December 31, 2013, Andy Chapman announced he was leaving the Zone.\n\nIn November 2014, Rachel Bonnetta and Adam Christie left ''The Zone'', and Lisa Gilroy from ''Undercover High'' got added to the team. Around the same time, a brand new contest called \"The Z-Head Zearch\" was introduced asking fans to submit videos to be aired on ''The Zone''.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'', ''[[Scaredy Squirrel]]'', and ''[[Breadwinners (TV series)|Breadwinners]]'' were removed from the lineup to make room for ''[[Pig Goat Banana Cricket]]'', ''[[Littlest Pet Shop (2012 TV series)|Littlest Pet Shop]]'', and ''[[Harvey Beaks]]''.\n\nOn September 11, 2016, ''[[Harvey Beaks]]'' was replaced by ''[[The Loud House]]'', and ''[[Pig Goat Banana Cricket]]'' was replaced by ''[[The Amazing Spiez!]]''. ''[[Littlest Pet Shop (2012 TV series)|Littlest Pet Shop]]'' was removed from the lineup.\n\nOn January 7, 2017, Meisha Watson began co-hosting ''The Zone Weekend''.<ref>{{cite web |title=YTV (2017) - 1st Zone Weekend of 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYQzKRK19Gs |website=YouTube |publisher=MIKER PHONE |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn June 5, 2017, ''[[The Amazing Spiez!]]'' and ''[[Numb Chucks]]'' were removed from the lineup to make room for ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (TV series)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' and ''[[Bunsen Is a Beast]]''.\n\nOn July 17, 2017, ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'' was replaced by ''[[The ZhuZhus]]''.\n\nOn August 28, 2017, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' was replaced by ''[[Grojband]]'', while ''[[Nerds and Monsters]]'' was replaced by ''[[Mysticons]]''.\n\nOn May 23, 2018, Spencer Litzinger joined ''The Zone''.<ref>{{cite web |title=YTV (2018) - The Zone: TMNT Day Segments ft.

The stories were set in the past but contained many [[anachronism]]s. [[Robert van Gulik]] came across the 18th century anonymously-written Chinese manuscript ''[[Di Gong An]]'', in his view closer to the Western tradition of detective fiction than other ''gong'an'' tales and so more likely to appeal to non-Chinese readers, and in 1949 published it in English as ''[[Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee]]''.

Afghanistan}}\nRape in [[Afghanistan]] is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of honour killings perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country: they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be [[punishable by death]].

During the first half of the 20th century, in some areas of Italy, like in many other places, rape victims were often expected and forced to marry their rapist. In 1965, a 17-year-old girl from [[Sicily]], created a sensation when she refused to marry the man who [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and raped her. In refusing this \"rehabilitating marriage\" to the perpetrator, she went against the traditional social norms of the time which dictated such a solution. The Criminal Code of Italy also supported this practice, by exonerating the rapist who married his victim. The article of law whereby a rapist could extinguish his crime by marrying his victim was abolished in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivaldeldiritto.it/app/document-detail.jsp?id_prodotto=2996&IdC1=1169&css=&tipo=0 |title=Festival del diritto |publisher=Festivaldeldiritto.it |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> The Franca Viola incident was made into a movie called [[La moglie pi\u00f9 bella]].\n\nIn 1999, in an infamous case that gained international attention, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] of Italy declared a man not guilty of the rape of a woman who was wearing tight jeans, claiming that it was impossible to forcibly remove tight jeans \"without the collaboration of the person wearing them\" if she resists. The court also equated the removal of the jeans with consent to sexual penetration. Following this ruling, there was outrage, both in Italy and abroad.

Tuerkheimer reviewed the literature on rape allegations, and reported on the problems surrounding credibility of rape victims, and how that relates to false rape accusations. She pointed to national survey data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that indicates 1 in every 5 women (and 1 in 71 men) will be raped during their lifetime at some point. Despite the prevalence of rape and the fact that false rape allegations are rare, Tuerkheimer reported that law enforcement officers often default to disbelief about an alleged rape. This documented prejudice leads to reduced investigation and criminal justice outcomes that are faulty compared to other crimes. Tuerkheimer says that women face \"credibility discounts\" at all stages of the justice system, including from police, jurors, judges and prosecutors. These credibility discounts are especially pronounced when the victim is acquainted with the accuser, and the vast majority of rapes fall into this category.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deborah|first=Tuerkheimer|date=2017|title=Incredible Women: Sexual Violence and the Credibility Discount|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol166/iss1/1/|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|language=en|volume=166|issue=1}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] estimated from 2005-2007 that about 2% of victims who were raped while incapacitated (from drugs, alcohol or other reason) reported the rape to the police, compared to 13% of victims who experienced physically forced sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Justice: Campus Sex Assault (CSA) Study|last=|first=|date=December 2007|website=www.ncjrs.gov|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 1998 the National Violence Against Women Survey, based on a sample size of 8000, described the incidence of rape as 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men based upon the report of experiencing an attempted or completed rape in her or his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/172837.pdf|title=Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings of the National Violence Against Women Survey|date=November 1998|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>\n\nA 1997 study on the non-institutionalized, non-military population by the U.S. [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], which defines rape as forced penetration by the offender,<ref>Bureau of Justice Statistics, [http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=317#terms_def Terms and Definitions]</ref> found that 91% of reported rape victims are female and 9% are male.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF|title=Pages 5 and 8|publisher=Bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov|accessdate=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305070553/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/soo.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of rapes in the United States go unreported.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reporting of Sexual Violence Incidents|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/pages/rape-notification.aspx|work=[[National Institute of Justice]]|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"huffpost\">{{Cite newspaper|last1=Thomas|first1=Emily|title=Rape Is Grossly Underreported In The U.S., Study Finds|journal=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/rape-study-report-america-us_n_4310765.html|accessdate=7 June 2016|date=21 November 2013}}</ref> According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most [[Under-reporting|under-reported]] violent crime.<ref>American Medical Association (1995) Sexual Assault in America.

The study found that 3.1% of undergraduate women reported experiencing an act that met the researchers' definition of rape or attempted rape during a 6\u20137-month academic year. However, of those found to have experienced completed rape, only 46.5% of the victims answered that they considered the incident to be a rape, while 48.8% did not and 4.7% were unsure. The study also found that 10.1% of college women experienced rape and 10.9% experienced attempted rape prior to entering college. Victimization of men was not considered as part of this study.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Bonnie|title=The Sexual Victimization of College Women|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf|publisher=The U.S. Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\nIn a different section of the report, the authors speculate about whether statistics during an academic year generalize to an entire college experience. For a full discussion, read more on page 10 of the report, stating that \"... the percentage of completed or attempted rape victimization among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter\" and further acknowledging in the corresponding footnote, #18, that \"These projections are suggestive. To assess accurately the victimization risk for women throughout a college career, longitudinal research following a cohort of female students across time is needed.\"\n\n80,000 American children are sexually abused each year.

Sexually violent crimes targeting children involve forced sexual activities such as intercourse, masturbation, and/or other explicit contact with a minor. According to Child Protective Services, eighty percent of the time, a parent ends up being the perpetrator.

Afghanistan}}\nRape in [[Afghanistan]] is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of honour killings perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country: they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be [[punishable by death]]. Furthermore, they can be forced by their families to marry their rapist. In 2011, Afghanistan made international news in regard to the story of a woman who was raped by a man, jailed for adultery, gave birth to a child in jail, and was then subsequently pardoned by president [[Hamid Karzai]], and in the end married the man who raped her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16179236 |title=Jailed Afghanistan rape victim Gulnaz is freed |work=BBC News |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/gulnaz-afghan-rape-afghanistan-adultery-karzai |title=Gulnaz: the Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist - Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref> In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honour killings and 160 cases of rape, but the number for both honour killings and rapes is estimated to be much higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/240-cases-of-honor-killing-recorded-in-afghanistan-aihrc-2177 |title=240 cases of honor killing recorded in Afghanistan |publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=9 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/ |title=AIHRC: 400 rape, honor killings registered in Afghanistan in 2 years |work=Latin Business Today |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214224858/http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/|archivedate=2015}}</ref> In 2013, in eastern Ghazni, a man attacked a woman and attempted to rape her, and as a result the relatives of the woman killed both the woman and the man in an honour killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/honor-killing-afghan-man-and-woman-killed-in-ghazni-1254 |title=Honor killing: Afghan man and woman killed in Ghazni|publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=16 January 2013}}</ref> In Afghanistan, crimes such as adultery, rape and trafficking are often conflated with each other,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |title=Executive Summary : Human Trafficking and Afghanistan |publisher=Cimicweb.org |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104055649/https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and it is generally not acceptable for a woman and a man to be alone together (unless married or related), and if this happens the response can be very violent: an Afghan medical doctor and his female patient were attacked by an angry mob who threw stones at them after the two were discovered in his private examining room without a chaperon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/asia/afghan-doctor-is-killed.html?_r=0|title=Mob Attacks Afghan Doctor and Female Patient|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-12-04|first=Rod|last=Nordland|date=13 June 2013}}</ref> Recently, the security forces have been also alleged to rape children in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/routine-child-rape-by-afghan-police/ |title=Routine Child Rape by Afghan Police |work=The American Conservative |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n{{Further|Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women}}\nArticle 336 of the Penal Code stipulates that rape is a punishable offence, but does not give a definition of rape (which is left to the courts).

More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists, signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called \"demeaning\", to be abolished, as it \"does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/bangladesh-activists-urge-ban-on-rape-victim-finger-test-326175 |title=Bangladesh activists urge ban on rape victim 'finger test' |publisher=NDTV.com |date=4 February 2013 |access-date=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/rape-exam-india/index.html |title=Activists: Get rid of 'degrading' parts of India's sexual assault exam |publisher=CNN.com |access-date=2013-12-03 |date=6 February 2013}}</ref> On 12 April 2018 Bangladesh High Court banned the \"two-finger test\" on the ground that the tests have no scientific merit or evidential value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/court/2018/04/12/high-court-bans-two-finger-tests-rape/|title=High Court bans 'two finger tests' for rape {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29|date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/04/12/hc-bans-use-of-two-finger-test-bio-manual-test-during-examinations-of-rape-victims|title=HC bans use of 'two-finger test', 'bio-manual test' during examinations of rape victims|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween the years of 2010 and 2013, the United Nations Multi-country Study on Men and Violence asked men in rural and urban Bangladesh if they had forced a woman to have sex at any point in their lives. 14.1% of men in rural Bangladesh and 9.5% of men in urban Bangladesh said yes (10% averaged). 2.7% of men in rural Bangladesh and 0.5% (6/1252) in urban Bangladesh had raped in the past year.

Despite the prevalence of rape and the fact that false rape allegations are rare, Tuerkheimer reported that law enforcement officers often default to disbelief about an alleged rape. This documented prejudice leads to reduced investigation and criminal justice outcomes that are faulty compared to other crimes. Tuerkheimer says that women face \"credibility discounts\" at all stages of the justice system, including from police, jurors, judges and prosecutors.

For a full discussion, read more on page 10 of the report, stating that \"... the percentage of completed or attempted rape victimization among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter\" and further acknowledging in the corresponding footnote, #18, that \"These projections are suggestive.

This ensures that the area biopsies correlates to the abnormality seen on mammogram. It\u2019s called stereotactic since it utilizes images taken from two different angles of the same location.

The key to understanding DBT is analogous to understanding the difference between an x-ray and CT.  Specifically, one is three dimensional whereas the other is flat. A mammogram usually takes two x-rays of each breast from different angles whereas digital tomosynthesis creates a 3-dimensional picture of the breast using x-rays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/dig_tomosynth|title=Digital Tomosynthesis|date=2016-06-23|website=Breastcancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nIn DBT, like conventional mammography, compression is used to improve image quality and decreases radiation dose.  The laminographic imaging technique dates back to the 1930s and belongs to the category of geometric or linear tomography.<ref>Dedicated Computed Tomography of the Breast: Image Processing and Its Impact on Breast Mass Detectability. Qing Xia. 2007. {{ISBN|0549663193}} pp.4</ref> Because the data acquired are very high resolution (85 \u2013 160 micron typical ), much higher than CT, DBT is unable to offer the  narrow slice widths that CT offers (typically 1-1.5&nbsp;mm). However, the higher resolution detectors permit very high in-plane resolution, even if the Z-axis resolution is less. The primary interest in DBT is in breast imaging, as an extension to [[mammography]], where it offers better detection rates .<ref>Smith AP, Niklason L, Ren B, Wu T, Ruth C, Jing Z.

The laminographic imaging technique dates back to the 1930s and belongs to the category of geometric or linear tomography.<ref>Dedicated Computed Tomography of the Breast: Image Processing and Its Impact on Breast Mass Detectability. Qing Xia. 2007. {{ISBN|0549663193}} pp.4</ref> Because the data acquired are very high resolution (85 \u2013 160 micron typical ), much higher than CT, DBT is unable to offer the  narrow slice widths that CT offers (typically 1-1.5&nbsp;mm).
