truss]]-type [[road bridge]] that carries the [[Silver City Highway]] across the [[Murray River]], between {{NSWcity|Curlwaa}} in [[New South Wales]], and {{VICcity|Yelta}} in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Department of Public Works]] and was designed by [[Percy Allan]]. It was the second last [[vertical-lift bridge]] to be built over the river, the last being the [[Nyah]] Bridge, which opened in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wakool.nsw.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1056591:nyah-lift-span-bridge&catid=2300&Itemid=3493|title=Nyah Lift Span Bridge|publisher=Wakool Shire Council|accessdate=26 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was constructed over a three-year period from 1925. The project was not originally planned to take as long, but there were delays due to problems with a contractor, and [[industrial action]]. The bridge was designed to carry the [[Mildura railway line]] over the Murray River and into New South Wales, to service significant cross-border traffic arising from the fruit-growing industry, but the line was never extended beyond the terminus at Yelta. The bridge currently carries a single lane of road controlled by [[traffic light]]s.\n\nIn 1931, there was a major accident at the bridge when a [[paddle steamer]] clipped the lift span, tearing apart the upper deck of the boat.\n\n==Description==\nAbbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss bridge that is about {{convert|240|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name=\"Google Maps Length\"/> The bridge also contains a single [[vertical-lift bridge|lift span]] about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, which is still in working order.<ref name=\"oeh\">{{cite web|title=Abbotsford Bridge over Murray River|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4301082|publisher=NSW Office of Environment and Heritage|accessdate=2017-02-01}}</ref><ref name=\"BridgeRecent\">{{cite news | url=http://www.milduraindependent.com/news/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5170:wentworth-shire-announces-new-procedures-associated-with-bridge-span-lifts-&catid=1:news&Itemid=2 | title=Wentworth Shire announces new procedures associated with bridge span lifts |newspaper=Mildura Independent | date=4 February 2013 | accessdate=28 August 2013}}</ref> It is two lanes wide through most of its length, but the lift span is only capable of carrying a single lane.<ref name=\"oeh\"/> The entire bridge has been marked with a single lane and has traffic lights on both ends to control vehicular flow.<ref name=\"Google MapsSV\">{{Google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=-34.113208,141.989177&spn=0.002134,0.004128&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=-34.113321,141.989212&panoid=D6DVovn9bso_juyGiMQ9tg&cbp=12,212.9,,0,4.15 |title=Abbotsford Bridge (Streetview) |accessdate=28 August 2013 |link= no}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was completed in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, it was designed to carry the loads required for a railway,<ref name=\"oeh\"/> once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge.<ref name=\"rails\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2058043 |title=Border Railways |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=28 October 1924 |accessdate=29 August 2013 |page=17}}</ref><ref name=\"rails2\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46011028 |title=Outback Conditions |newspaper=[[The Barrier Miner]] |location=Broken Hill, NSW |date=5 May 1927 |accessdate=29 August 2013 |page=3}}</ref> The line was never extended beyond [[Yelta, Victoria|Yelta]], where the terminus remains to this day.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vrhistory.com/Locations/Mildura-Yelta.pdf |format= PDF | title=Midura\u2013Yelta | work=Signalling Histories | date=February 2003 | accessdate=29 August 2013 | author=Waugh, Andrew | pages=4\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"LANDmap\">{{cite web | url=http://services.land.vic.gov.au/maps/interactive.jsp | title=Interactive Map | publisher=Department of Environment and Primary Industries | work=Land Channel | accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the [[Sturt Highway]] without travelling farther upstream to [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]].

In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit [[Curlwaa, New South Wales|Curlwaa]], Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at \u00a378,000.

The town lies on the [[R445 road|R445]], some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) west of Dublin \u2013 near enough for it to have become, despite being a regional centre in its own right, a [[commuter town]] for the capital. Although Kildare gives its name to the county, [[Naas]] is the county town.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding by Saint Brigid===\nRich in heritage and history, Kildare Town dates from the 5th century, when it was the site of the original 'Church of the Oak' and monastery founded by Saint Brigid. This became one of the three most important Christian foundations in Celtic Ireland.\n\nIt was said that Brigid's mother was a Christian and that Brigid was reared in her father's family, that is with the children of his lawful wife. From her mother, Brigid learned dairying and the care of the cattle, and these were her occupations after she made a vow to live a life of holy chastity. Both Saint Mel of Ardagh and Bishop {{lang|ga|Mac Caille}} have been credited with the consecration of Brigid and some companions, after which the woman established a community beneath an oak tree, on a hill on the edge of the Curragh. Hence the name {{lang|ga|Cill Dara}}, the church of the oak.\n\nNot too far away, on {{lang|ga|[[D\u00fan Ailinne]]}}, lived the King of Leinster who had donated the site to the holy woman. A story told was that the King had offered Brigid as much land as her cloak would cover. When she spread her garment it miraculously stretched out to embrace the entire Curragh. True to his promise, the King gave her the fertile plain, and there the new community grazed their sheep and cows.\n\n===Carmelite Friary (White Abbey) Church, Kildare===\n\nThe Carmelite Friars accepted the invitation of Lord William de Vesci and came to Kildare in 1290. This same de Vesci also established the Franciscans in the Grey Abbey and built the original castle of Kildare. With the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII, White Abbey was surrendered on 3 April 1539. The Friars, however, continued to minister clandestinely to the people of the area during the next two centuries. When the Penal Laws were relaxed in the 1750s the Carmelites returned to Kildare and erected a church and a school close to or on the original 1290 foundation. This eighteenth century church served the Carmelites and the people in the district for more than one hundred years. The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 8 December 1884. The architect was William Hague who designed churches in the Pugin style. The church is therefore gothic in design and the builder was John Harris of Monasterevan, who used Wicklow granite and local stone from Boston, Rathangan. The church is cruciform in plan with the nave being set off with alternating window and arched roof-truss. The transepts are defined by polished granite pillars with moulded bases and carved caps which support arches in line with the walls of the nave. The side chapels are seen from the transepts and chancel through arches springing from moulded piers which also support the large chancel arch with its polished granite corbel shafts, moulded bases and carved caps. The principal entrance doorway faces east with pillared jambs, carved tympanum and moulded arches set in a projecting porch. The tower, with its lantern belfry, extends above the level of the nave roof. It has deeply recessed windows on each face and is finished with a moulded cornice. From this point, the tapering spire rises to a height of 40 metres and is surmounted by a cross. On the north transept wall of the church are inserted \u2013 for safekeeping \u2013 some interesting fifteenth/sixteenth century stone sculptures which came from the ruins of the Franciscan Grey Abbey. They are similar to the carvings from Great Connell and Dunfierth, also in Co Kildare, and probably came from the same workshop. The stained glass in the church includes scenes from the lives of Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, from the Scapular Vision, as well as Saints Patrick and Brigid, and the four Evangelists. The rose window over the main entrance is of special interest with its centrepiece being the Prophet Elijah, the spiritual founder of the Order. The surrounding panels show St Telesphorus, St Dionysius, St Albert (Patriarch of Jerusalem), St Andrew Corsini, St Cyril of Alexandria, St Louis IX, St Angelus, and St Albert of Sicily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmelites.ie/whiteabbeykildare.html|title=Carmelite Friary, White Abbey, Kildare Town|website=www.carmelites.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016,  the Carmelite Church and Friary were entrusted to the Indian Carmelites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocarm.in/index.php/home/communities/white-abbey-kildare-irelnad/|title=White Abbey, Kildare Town (Ireland) {{!}} O.Carm|website=www.ocarm.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Milestone in early motorsport===\n[[File:Kildare Town and Surrounds.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Kildare Castle]]\n{{see|1903 Gordon Bennett Cup}}\nIn July 1903, the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]] ran through Kildare. It was the first international motor race to be held in Britain or Ireland. The [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland]] wanted the race to be hosted in Britain or Ireland, and Ireland was suggested as racing was illegal on British public roads. The editor of the ''Dublin Motor News'' suggested an area in [[County Kildare]], and letters were sent to politicians, newspapers, railway companies, hoteliers, and clergy to win support and amend local laws. Kildare was chosen, among other candidate venues, partly because the straightness of the roads was deemed a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in [[Variations of green#Shamrock green|Shamrock green]]{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} which became known as [[British racing green]].<ref name=Champanellois/><ref name=Leinster/><ref name=Forix_GBT_1903/><ref name=Forix_Gordon_B/> The 528&nbsp;km race ran on a loop through parts of counties Kildare and Carlow, including Kildare town.

The town lies on the [[R445 road|R445]], some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) west of Dublin \u2013 near enough for it to have become, despite being a regional centre in its own right, a [[commuter town]] for the capital. Although Kildare gives its name to the county, [[Naas]] is the county town.\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding by Saint Brigid===\nRich in heritage and history, Kildare Town dates from the 5th century, when it was the site of the original 'Church of the Oak' and monastery founded by Saint Brigid. This became one of the three most important Christian foundations in Celtic Ireland.\n\nIt was said that Brigid's mother was a Christian and that Brigid was reared in her father's family, that is with the children of his lawful wife. From her mother, Brigid learned dairying and the care of the cattle, and these were her occupations after she made a vow to live a life of holy chastity. Both Saint Mel of Ardagh and Bishop {{lang|ga|Mac Caille}} have been credited with the consecration of Brigid and some companions, after which the woman established a community beneath an oak tree, on a hill on the edge of the Curragh. Hence the name {{lang|ga|Cill Dara}}, the church of the oak.\n\nNot too far away, on {{lang|ga|[[D\u00fan Ailinne]]}}, lived the King of Leinster who had donated the site to the holy woman. A story told was that the King had offered Brigid as much land as her cloak would cover. When she spread her garment it miraculously stretched out to embrace the entire Curragh. True to his promise, the King gave her the fertile plain, and there the new community grazed their sheep and cows.\n\n===Carmelite Friary (White Abbey) Church, Kildare===\n\nThe Carmelite Friars accepted the invitation of Lord William de Vesci and came to Kildare in 1290. This same de Vesci also established the Franciscans in the Grey Abbey and built the original castle of Kildare. With the suppression of the monasteries under Henry VIII, White Abbey was surrendered on 3 April 1539. The Friars, however, continued to minister clandestinely to the people of the area during the next two centuries. When the Penal Laws were relaxed in the 1750s the Carmelites returned to Kildare and erected a church and a school close to or on the original 1290 foundation. This eighteenth century church served the Carmelites and the people in the district for more than one hundred years. The foundation stone of the present church was laid on 8 December 1884. The architect was William Hague who designed churches in the Pugin style. The church is therefore gothic in design and the builder was John Harris of Monasterevan, who used Wicklow granite and local stone from Boston, Rathangan. The church is cruciform in plan with the nave being set off with alternating window and arched roof-truss. The transepts are defined by polished granite pillars with moulded bases and carved caps which support arches in line with the walls of the nave. The side chapels are seen from the transepts and chancel through arches springing from moulded piers which also support the large chancel arch with its polished granite corbel shafts, moulded bases and carved caps. The principal entrance doorway faces east with pillared jambs, carved tympanum and moulded arches set in a projecting porch. The tower, with its lantern belfry, extends above the level of the nave roof. It has deeply recessed windows on each face and is finished with a moulded cornice. From this point, the tapering spire rises to a height of 40 metres and is surmounted by a cross. On the north transept wall of the church are inserted \u2013 for safekeeping \u2013 some interesting fifteenth/sixteenth century stone sculptures which came from the ruins of the Franciscan Grey Abbey. They are similar to the carvings from Great Connell and Dunfierth, also in Co Kildare, and probably came from the same workshop. The stained glass in the church includes scenes from the lives of Our Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, from the Scapular Vision, as well as Saints Patrick and Brigid, and the four Evangelists. The rose window over the main entrance is of special interest with its centrepiece being the Prophet Elijah, the spiritual founder of the Order. The surrounding panels show St Telesphorus, St Dionysius, St Albert (Patriarch of Jerusalem), St Andrew Corsini, St Cyril of Alexandria, St Louis IX, St Angelus, and St Albert of Sicily.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmelites.ie/whiteabbeykildare.html|title=Carmelite Friary, White Abbey, Kildare Town|website=www.carmelites.ie|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2016,  the Carmelite Church and Friary were entrusted to the Indian Carmelites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocarm.in/index.php/home/communities/white-abbey-kildare-irelnad/|title=White Abbey, Kildare Town (Ireland) {{!}} O.Carm|website=www.ocarm.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===Milestone in early motorsport===\n[[File:Kildare Town and Surrounds.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Kildare Castle]]\n{{see|1903 Gordon Bennett Cup}}\nIn July 1903, the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett Cup]] ran through Kildare. It was the first international motor race to be held in Britain or Ireland. The [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland]] wanted the race to be hosted in Britain or Ireland, and Ireland was suggested as racing was illegal on British public roads. The editor of the ''Dublin Motor News'' suggested an area in [[County Kildare]], and letters were sent to politicians, newspapers, railway companies, hoteliers, and clergy to win support and amend local laws. Kildare was chosen, among other candidate venues, partly because the straightness of the roads was deemed a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in [[Variations of green#Shamrock green|Shamrock green]]{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} which became known as [[British racing green]].<ref name=Champanellois/><ref name=Leinster/><ref name=Forix_GBT_1903/><ref name=Forix_Gordon_B/> The 528&nbsp;km race ran on a loop through parts of counties Kildare and Carlow, including Kildare town.

Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as \"clubs\".

Late{{clarify|date=August 2018}} [[rugby football|rugby]] clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a \"football club\", or as a \"rugby football club\". \"[[Sports club|Club]]\" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few [[high school]] or university ''teams'' were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as \"clubs\". That has always been the case, for example, in [[American football]], which has always had ties to [[college sport]] in general. Conversely, however, the ''oldest'' still-existing \"football club\" with a well-documented, continuous history is [[Dublin University Football Club]], a rugby union club founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Ireland (country of the United Kingdom)|Ireland]], although there exists some record of [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]] being founded in 1843.\n\n==British Isles==\n\n===Defunct clubs===\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | header =\n | image1 = Bodyguard vs Fearnoughts 1841.png\n | caption1 =\n | image2 = Bodyguard vs Fearnoughts Report 1842.png\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Newspaper articles describing the game between the Body-guard Club and the Fear-nought Club, held on Christmas Day 1841}}\nWhile the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct.

Some accounts, like [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', state he won and his jealous competitors ambushed and murdered him. Others, such as ''Graeciae Descriptio'' by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], say he was trampled to death by a [[cretan bull|mad bull]].\n\n==Religious festival==\n\nThe competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event \u2013 Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waldstein|first1=Charles|title=The Panathenaic Festival and the Central Slab of the Parthenon Frieze|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=1885|volume=1|issue=1|pages=10\u201317|doi=10.2307/495977|ref=JSTOR|jstor=495977}}</ref> A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3\u20134 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of [[Athens]], but not as important as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] or the other [[Panhellenic Games]].\n\n==Ceremony==\n\n\n\nAward ceremonies included the giving of [[Panathenaic amphora]]e which were the large ceramic vessels that contained the oil given as prizes.  The winner of the [[chariot race]] received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.\n\n== Cultural events ==\n\nThe Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions.  Prizes were awarded for [[rhapsode|rhapsodic]] recitation of [[Homer]]ic poetry, for instrumental music on the [[aulos|aulus]] and [[cithara]], and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara ([[citharede|citharody]]). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n\n==The Panathenaic Stadium==\n\nThe athletic events were staged at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], which is still in use today. In 1865, [[Evangelis Zappas]] left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years \"in the manner of our ancestors\".<ref>The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C.

The stadium also hosted the [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] [[Intercalated Games]].\n\n== Contests ==\nThe Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12\u201316; beardless youths: 16\u201320; men: over 20.<ref name=Neils>{{cite book|last1=Neils|first1=Jennifer|title=Goddess and Polis: The Panathenanic Festival In Ancient Athens|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}</ref> One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor.\n\nUsing the inscription, experts put together a general program like so: Day 1: Musical and Rhapsodic Contest; Day 2: Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths; Day 3: Athletic Contest for Men; Day 4: Equestrian Contest; Day 5: Tribal Contest; Day 6: Torch Race and Sacrifice; Day 7: Boat Race; Day 8: Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations.<ref name=Neils/> Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling was also a part of the contest as well as discus.\n\nThe musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphoras of olive oil.<ref name=Neils />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Roisman, Joseph, and translated by J.C Yardley, ''Ancient Greece from Homer to Alexander'', Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2011, {{ISBN|1-4051-2776-7}}\n* Young, David C., ''A Brief History of the Olympic Games'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-1129-4}}\n\n{{Multi-sport events}}\n{{Greek religion}}\n\n[[Category:Panathenaic Games| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek athletic festivals]]\n[[Category:Archaic Athens]]\n[[Category:Festivals in ancient Athens]]\n[[Category:Festivals of Athena]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established before 1750]]\n[[Category:Sports festivals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}\n[[Image:Greek vase with runners at the panathenaic games 530 bC.jpg|thumb|Greek vase depicting runners at the Panathenaic Games c. 530 BC]]\n\nThe '''Panathenaic Games''' ({{lang-grc|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1}}) were held every four years in [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]] from 566 BC<ref>A Brief History of the Olympic Games by David C.

Some accounts, like [[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]'s ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', state he won and his jealous competitors ambushed and murdered him. Others, such as ''Graeciae Descriptio'' by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], say he was trampled to death by a [[cretan bull|mad bull]].\n\n==Religious festival==\n\nThe competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event - Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waldstein|first1=Charles|title=The Panathenaic Festival and the Central Slab of the Parthenon Frieze|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=1885|volume=1|issue=1|pages=10\u201317|doi=10.2307/495977|ref=JSTOR|jstor=495977}}</ref> A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3\u20134 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of [[Athens]], but not as important as the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] or the other [[Panhellenic Games]].\n\n==Ceremony==\n\n\n\nAward ceremonies included the giving of [[Panathenaic amphora]]e which were the large ceramic vessels that contained the oil given as prizes.  The winner of the [[chariot race]] received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.\n\n== Cultural events ==\n\nThe Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions.  Prizes were awarded for [[rhapsode|rhapsodic]] recitation of [[Homer]]ic poetry, for instrumental music on the [[aulos|aulus]] and [[cithara]], and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara ([[citharede|citharody]]). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n\n==The Panathenaic Stadium==\n\nThe athletic events were staged at the [[Panathenaic Stadium]], which is still in use today. In 1865, [[Evangelis Zappas]] left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years \"in the manner of our ancestors\".<ref>The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C.
