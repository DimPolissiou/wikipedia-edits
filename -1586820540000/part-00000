The two ships were a British response to the express [[superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]] built by German, Italian and French companies in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\n''Queen Mary'' sailed on her [[maiden voyage]] on 27 May 1936 and won the [[Blue Riband]] that August;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/fascinating-facts-about-queen-mary-cruise-ship/|title=Remarkable things you didn't know about the Queen Mary ocean liner|work=The Telegraph|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> she lost the title to {{SS|Normandie}} in 1937 and recaptured it in 1938, holding it until 1952 when it was taken by the new {{SS|United States}}. With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], she was converted into a [[troopship]] and ferried [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers during the conflict.\n\nFollowing the war, ''Queen Mary'' was refitted for passenger service and along with ''Queen Elizabeth'' commenced the two-ship [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] passenger service for which the two ships were initially built. The two ships dominated the transatlantic passenger transportation market until the dawn of the [[jet age]] in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, ''Queen Mary'' was ageing and was operating at a loss.\n\nAfter several years of decreased profits for Cunard Line, ''Queen Mary'' was officially retired from service in 1967. She left [[Southampton]] for the last time on 31 October 1967 and sailed to the port of [[Long Beach, California]], United States, where she remains [[Hulk (ship type)|permanently moored]]. The ship serves as a tourist attraction featuring restaurants, a [[museum ship|museum]] and a hotel. The ship is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The loan was granted, with enough money to complete the unfinished ship, and also to build a running mate, with the intention to provide a two-ship weekly service to New York.<ref name=\"OConnor\"/>\n\nOne condition of the loan was that Cunard would merge with the White Star Line, which was Cunard's chief British rival at the time and which had already been forced by the depression to cancel construction of its ''Oceanic''. Both lines agreed and the merger was completed on 10 May 1934. Work on ''Queen Mary'' resumed immediately and she was launched on 26 September 1934.

Until her launch, the name was kept a closely guarded secret. Legend has it that Cunard intended to name the ship ''[[Queen Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', in keeping with company tradition of giving its ships names ending in \"ia\", but when company representatives asked the king's permission to name the ocean liner after Britain's \"greatest Queen\", he said his wife, Mary of Teck, would be delighted.<ref name=\"cross288-289\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Maxtone-Graham\n|first=John\n|title=The Only Way to Cross\n|location=New York\n|publisher=Collier Books\n|year=1972\n|pages=288\u2013289\n}}</ref> And so, the legend goes, the delegation had of course no other choice but to report that No. 534 would be called ''Queen Mary''.<ref name=\"cross288-289\" />\n\nThis story was denied by company officials, and traditionally the names of sovereigns have only been used for capital ships of the [[Royal Navy]].

Bates told him the story of the naming of the ship \"on condition you won't print it during my lifetime.\" The name ''Queen Mary'' could also have been decided upon as a compromise between Cunard and the [[White Star Line]], as both lines had traditions of using names either ending in \"ic\" with White Star and \"ia\" with Cunard.<ref name=\"cross288-289\" />\n\nThe name had already been given to the [[Clyde steamer|Clyde turbine steamer]] {{ship|TS|Queen Mary}}, so Cunard made an arrangement with its owners and this older ship was renamed ''Queen Mary II''.<ref name=\"Baldwin2010\">{{cite book|author=David Baldwin|title=Royal Prayer: A Surprising History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7DZlsPleCSsC&pg=PA20|date=2 February 2010|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2303-0|page=20}}</ref>\n\n''Queen Mary'' was fitted with 24 Yarrow boilers in four boiler rooms and four Parsons turbines in two engine rooms.

It had been decided to clear almost every area of the ship below \"C\" deck (called \"R\" deck after 1950, to lessen passenger confusion, as the restaurants were located on \"R\" deck) to make way for [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s new Living Sea Museum. This increased museum space to {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}}.\n\nIt required removal of all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both turbo generator rooms, the ship stabilisers and the water softening plant. The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had been affected by the removal of the various components and structure. Only the aft engine room and \"shaft alley\", at the stern of the ship, would be spared. Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.\n\nOne problem that arose during the conversion was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The [[United States Coast Guard]] had final say. ''Queen Mary'' was deemed a building, since most of her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previous. During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary Hotel Cabin Corridor.jpg|thumb|Passageway in First Class accommodation, now part of the onboard hotel]]\n\nWith all of the lower decks nearly gutted from R deck and down, [[Diners Club]], the initial lessee of the ship, converted the remainder of the vessel into a hotel. Diners Club Queen Mary dissolved and vacated the ship in 1970 after their parent company, Diners Club International, was sold, and a change in corporate direction was mandated during the conversion process. Specialty Restaurants, a Los Angeles-based company that focused on theme-based restaurants, took over as master lessee the following year.\n\nThis second plan was based on converting most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces. On Promenade Deck, the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and caf\u00e9 named [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson's]] and [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton's]]; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th century sailing ships. The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary bridge.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Mary''{{'s}} bridge]]\n\nThe smaller first-class public rooms, such as the Drawing Room, Library, Lecture Room and the Music Studio, would be stripped of most of their fittings and converted to commercial use. This markedly expanded retail space on the ship. Two more shopping malls were built on the Sun Deck in separate spaces previously used for first-class cabins and engineers' quarters.\n\nA post-war feature of the ship, the first-class cinema, was removed for kitchen space for the new Promenade Deck dining venues. The first-class lounge and smoking room were reconfigured and converted into banquet space. The second-class smoking room was subdivided into a wedding chapel and office space. On the Sun Deck, the elegant Verandah Grill would be gutted and converted into a fast-food eatery, while a new upscale dining venue was created directly above it on Sports Deck, in space once used for crew quarters.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary Panoramic Sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Sun setting behind the Queen Mary in Long Beach.]]\n\nThe second-class lounges were expanded to the sides of the ship and used for banqueting. On R deck, the first-class dining room was reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor Room. The second-class dining room was subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class dining room was initially used as storage and crew space.\n\nAlso on R deck, the first-class Turkish bath complex, the 1930s equivalent to a spa, was removed. The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was open for viewing by hotel guests and visitors. Because of modern safety codes and the compromised structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool could not be used for swimming after the conversion, although it was filled with water until the late 1980s. Today the pool can only be seen on guided tours and is in a derelict condition, having never been maintained by the hotel operators. No second-class, third-class or crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.\n\n===As a tourist attraction===\n[[File:Hotel Queen Mary, Long Beach 01.jpg|thumb|Ship as a hotel, with permanent boarding gangways]]\n\nOn 8 May 1971 ''Queen Mary'' opened her doors to tourists. Initially, only portions of the ship were open to the public as Specialty Restaurants had yet to open its dining venues and [[Pacific Southwest Airlines|PSA]] had not completed work converting the ship's original First Class staterooms into the hotel. As a result, the ship was open only on weekends. On 11 December 1971 [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s Museum of the Sea opened, with a quarter of the planned exhibits completed. Within the decade, Cousteau's museum closed due to low ticket sales and the deaths of many of the fish that were housed in the museum. On 2 November 1972 the PSA Hotel Queen Mary opened its initial 150 guest rooms. Two years later, with all 400 rooms finished, PSA brought in [[Hyatt Hotels]] to manage the hotel, which operated from 1974 to 1980 as the Queen Mary Hyatt Hotel.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750112&id=JrEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8WYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7148,4713999\n|title=Queen Mary now Hyatt House\n|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]\n|date=12 January 1975\n|first=Andrew H\n|last=Malcolm\n|agency=New York Times News Service\n|accessdate=29 December 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 1980, it had become apparent that the existing system was not working.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19760411&id=eHMjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M2cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6793,4464045\n|title=Queen Mary Ocean Liner Becomes an Albatross\n|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]\n|date=11 April 1976\n|first=Holger\n|last=Jensen\n|accessdate=29 December 2012\n}}</ref> The ship was losing millions each year for the city because the hotel, restaurants and museum were run by three separate concessionaires, while the city owned the vessel and operated guided tours.

Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property. He oversaw the display of the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|''Spruce Goose'']], on long-term loan. The immense plane, which had been sitting in a [[hangar]] in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge [[geodesic dome]] adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHis Wrather Port Properties operated the entire attraction after his death in 1984 until 1988, when his holdings were bought by the [[Walt Disney Company]]. Wrather had built the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] in 1955, when [[Walt Disney]] had insufficient funds to construct the hotel himself. Disney had been trying to buy the hotel for 30 years. When they finally succeeded, they also acquired  the ''Queen Mary.'' This was never marketed as a Disney property.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary cabin.jpg|thumb|left|First Class accommodation on ''Queen Mary'', converted into a present-day hotel room with modern curtains, bedding, fixtures and amenities surrounded by original wood panelling and portholes]]\n\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s the ''Queen Mary'' struggled financially.

It was to include an attraction known as [[DisneySea (California)|''DisneySea'']], a theme park celebrating the world's oceans. The plans eventually fell through; in 1992 Disney gave up the lease on the ship to focus on building what would become [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. The DisneySea concept was recycled a decade later in Japan as [[Tokyo DisneySea]], with a recreated ocean liner resembling ''Queen Mary'' named the [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|SS ''Columbia'']] as the centrepiece of the American Waterfront area.\n\nWith Disney gone, the Hotel ''Queen Mary'' closed on 30 September 1992. The owners of the ''Spruce Goose'', the Aero Club of Southern California, sold the plane to the [[Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum]] in [[Oregon]]. The plane departed on barges on 2 October 1992, leaving the huge dome empty. The Queen Mary tourist attraction remained open for another two months, but on 31 December 1992, the ''Queen Mary'' completely closed her doors to tourists and visitors.\n\nOn 5 February 1993, RMS Foundation, Inc signed a five-year lease with the city of Long Beach to act as the operators of the property. The foundation was run by President and C.E.O. Joseph F. Prevratil, who had managed the attraction for Wrather. On 26 February 1993 the tourist attraction reopened completely, while the hotel reopened partially on 5 March with 125 rooms and the banquet facilities, with the remainder of the rooms coming online on 30 April. In 1995, RMS Foundation's lease was extended to twenty years, while the scope of the lease was reduced to operation of the ship. A new company, Queen's Seaport Development, Inc. (QSDI), was established in 1995 to control the real estate adjacent to the vessel. In 1998, the city of Long Beach extended the QSDI lease to 66 years.\n\nIn 2004, ''Queen Mary'' and Stargazer Productions added Tibbies Great American Cabaret to the space previously occupied by the ship's bank and wireless telegraph room. Stargazer Productions and ''Queen Mary'' transformed the space into a working dinner theatre complete with stage, lights, sound and scullery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibbiescabaret.com/History.html|title=History|publisher=Tibbies Cabaret|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907104145/http://tibbiescabaret.com/History.html|archivedate=7 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Starboard sun deck of Queen Mary docked in Long Beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Starboard sun deck, 1972]]\n\nIn 2005, QSDI sought [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] protection due to a rent credit dispute with the city. In 2006, the bankruptcy court requested bids from parties interested in taking over the lease from QSDI. The minimum required opening bid was $41M. The operation of the ship, by RMS Foundation, remained independent of the bankruptcy. In summer 2007, ''Queen Mary''{{'s}} lease was sold to a group named \"Save the Queen\", managed by Hostmark Hospitality Group.\n\nThey planned to develop the land adjacent to ''Queen Mary'', and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with [[iPod]] docking stations and flatscreen TVs and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color. The portside Promenade Deck's planking was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.\n\nIn late September 2009, management of ''Queen Mary'' was taken over by [[Delaware North Companies]], who plan to continue restoration and renovation of the ship and its property. They were determined to revitalise and enhance the ship as an attraction.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://media.delawarenorth.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=689 |title=Delaware North on Board at Queen Mary |publisher=media.delawarenorth.com |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> But in April 2011, The city of Long Beach was informed that Delaware North was no longer managing ''Queen Mary''.

The two ships were a British response to the express [[superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]] built by German, Italian and French companies in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\n''Queen Mary'' sailed on her [[maiden voyage]] on 27 May 1936 and won the [[Blue Riband]] that August;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/fascinating-facts-about-queen-mary-cruise-ship/|title=Remarkable things you didn't know about the Queen Mary ocean liner|work=The Telegraph|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> she lost the title to {{SS|Normandie}} in 1937 and recaptured it in 1938, holding it until 1952 when it was taken by the new {{SS|United States}}. With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], she was converted into a [[troopship]] and ferried [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers during the conflict.\n\nFollowing the war, ''Queen Mary'' was refitted for passenger service and along with ''Queen Elizabeth'' commenced the two-ship [[Transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] passenger service for which the two ships were initially built. The two ships dominated the transatlantic passenger transportation market until the dawn of the [[jet age]] in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, ''Queen Mary'' was ageing and was operating at a loss.\n\nAfter several years of decreased profits for Cunard Line, ''Queen Mary'' was officially retired from service in 1967. She left [[Southampton]] for the last time on 31 October 1967 and sailed to the port of [[Long Beach, California]], United States, where she remains [[Hulk (ship type)|permanently moored]]. The ship serves as a tourist attraction featuring restaurants, a [[museum ship|museum]] and a hotel. The ship is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

It had been decided to clear almost every area of the ship below \"C\" deck (called \"R\" deck after 1950, to lessen passenger confusion, as the restaurants were located on \"R\" deck) to make way for [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s new Living Sea Museum. This increased museum space to {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}}.\n\nIt required removal of all the boiler rooms, the forward engine room, both turbo generator rooms, the ship stabilisers and the water softening plant. The ship's empty fuel tanks were filled with local mud to keep the ship's centre of gravity and draft at the correct levels, as these critical factors had been affected by the removal of the various components and structure. Only the aft engine room and \"shaft alley\", at the stern of the ship, would be spared. Remaining space would be used for storage or office space.\n\nOne problem that arose during the conversion was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The [[United States Coast Guard]] had final say. ''Queen Mary'' was deemed a building, since most of her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previous. During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to lift out the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary Hotel Cabin Corridor.jpg|thumb|Passageway in First Class accommodation, now part of the onboard hotel]]\n\nWith all of the lower decks nearly gutted from R deck and down, [[Diners Club]], the initial lessee of the ship, converted the remainder of the vessel into a hotel. Diners Club Queen Mary dissolved and vacated the ship in 1970 after their parent company, Diners Club International, was sold, and a change in corporate direction was mandated during the conversion process. Specialty Restaurants, a Los Angeles-based company that focused on theme-based restaurants, took over as master lessee the following year.\n\nThis second plan was based on converting most of her first- and second-class cabins on A and B decks into hotel rooms, and converting the main lounges and dining rooms into banquet spaces. On Promenade Deck, the starboard promenade was enclosed to feature an upscale restaurant and caf\u00e9 named [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson's]] and [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton's]]; it was themed in the fashion of early-19th century sailing ships. The famed and elegant Observation Bar was redecorated as a western-themed bar.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary bridge.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Mary''{{'s}} bridge]]\n\nThe smaller first-class public rooms, such as the Drawing Room, Library, Lecture Room and the Music Studio, would be stripped of most of their fittings and converted to commercial use. This markedly expanded retail space on the ship. Two more shopping malls were built on the Sun Deck in separate spaces previously used for first-class cabins and engineers' quarters.\n\nA post-war feature of the ship, the first-class cinema, was removed for kitchen space for the new Promenade Deck dining venues. The first-class lounge and smoking room were reconfigured and converted into banquet space. The second-class smoking room was subdivided into a wedding chapel and office space. On the Sun Deck, the elegant Verandah Grill would be gutted and converted into a fast-food eatery, while a new upscale dining venue was created directly above it on Sports Deck, in space once used for crew quarters.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary Panoramic Sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Sun setting behind the Queen Mary in Long Beach.]]\n\nThe second-class lounges were expanded to the sides of the ship and used for banqueting. On R deck, the first-class dining room was reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor Room. The second-class dining room was subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class dining room was initially used as storage and crew space.\n\nAlso on R deck, the first-class Turkish bath complex, the 1930s equivalent to a spa, was removed. The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was open for viewing by hotel guests and visitors. Because of modern safety codes and the compromised structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool could not be used for swimming after the conversion, although it was filled with water until the late 1980s. Today the pool can only be seen on guided tours and is in a derelict condition, having never been maintained by the hotel operators. No second-class, third-class or crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.\n\n===As a tourist attraction===\n[[File:Hotel Queen Mary, Long Beach 01.jpg|thumb|Ship as a hotel, with permanent boarding gangways]]\n\nOn 8 May 1971 ''Queen Mary'' opened her doors to tourists. Initially, only portions of the ship were open to the public as Specialty Restaurants had yet to open its dining venues and [[Pacific Southwest Airlines|PSA]] had not completed work converting the ship's original First Class staterooms into the hotel. As a result, the ship was open only on weekends. On 11 December 1971 [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s Museum of the Sea opened, with a quarter of the planned exhibits completed. Within the decade, Cousteau's museum closed due to low ticket sales and the deaths of many of the fish that were housed in the museum. On 2 November 1972 the PSA Hotel Queen Mary opened its initial 150 guest rooms. Two years later, with all 400 rooms finished, PSA brought in [[Hyatt Hotels]] to manage the hotel, which operated from 1974 to 1980 as the Queen Mary Hyatt Hotel.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19750112&id=JrEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8WYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7148,4713999\n|title=Queen Mary now Hyatt House\n|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]\n|date=12 January 1975\n|first=Andrew H\n|last=Malcolm\n|agency=New York Times News Service\n|accessdate=29 December 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 1980, it had become apparent that the existing system was not working.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19760411&id=eHMjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M2cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6793,4464045\n|title=Queen Mary Ocean Liner Becomes an Albatross\n|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]\n|date=11 April 1976\n|first=Holger\n|last=Jensen\n|accessdate=29 December 2012\n}}</ref> The ship was losing millions each year for the city because the hotel, restaurants and museum were run by three separate concessionaires, while the city owned the vessel and operated guided tours.

Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property. He oversaw the display of the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|''Spruce Goose'']], on long-term loan. The immense plane, which had been sitting in a [[hangar]] in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge [[geodesic dome]] adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHis Wrather Port Properties operated the entire attraction after his death in 1984 until 1988, when his holdings were bought by the [[Walt Disney Company]]. Wrather had built the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] in 1955, when [[Walt Disney]] had insufficient funds to construct the hotel himself. Disney had been trying to buy the hotel for 30 years. When they finally succeeded, they also acquired  the ''Queen Mary.'' This was never marketed as a Disney property.\n\n[[File:Queen Mary cabin.jpg|thumb|left|First Class accommodation on ''Queen Mary'', converted into a present-day hotel room with modern curtains, bedding, fixtures and amenities surrounded by original wood panelling and portholes]]\n\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s the ''Queen Mary'' struggled financially.

It was to include an attraction known as [[DisneySea (California)|''DisneySea'']], a theme park celebrating the world's oceans. The plans eventually fell through; in 1992 Disney gave up the lease on the ship to focus on building what would become [[Disney California Adventure Park]]. The DisneySea concept was recycled a decade later in Japan as [[Tokyo DisneySea]], with a recreated ocean liner resembling ''Queen Mary'' named the [[SS Columbia (Tokyo DisneySea)|SS ''Columbia'']] as the centrepiece of the American Waterfront area.\n\nWith Disney gone, the Hotel ''Queen Mary'' closed on 30 September 1992. The owners of the ''Spruce Goose'', the Aero Club of Southern California, sold the plane to the [[Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum]] in [[Oregon]]. The plane departed on barges on 2 October 1992, leaving the huge dome empty. The Queen Mary tourist attraction remained open for another two months, but on 31 December 1992, the ''Queen Mary'' completely closed her doors to tourists and visitors.\n\nOn 5 February 1993, RMS Foundation, Inc signed a five-year lease with the city of Long Beach to act as the operators of the property. The foundation was run by President and C.E.O. Joseph F. Prevratil, who had managed the attraction for Wrather. On 26 February 1993 the tourist attraction reopened completely, while the hotel reopened partially on 5 March with 125 rooms and the banquet facilities, with the remainder of the rooms coming online on 30 April. In 1995, RMS Foundation's lease was extended to twenty years, while the scope of the lease was reduced to operation of the ship. A new company, Queen's Seaport Development, Inc. (QSDI), was established in 1995 to control the real estate adjacent to the vessel. In 1998, the city of Long Beach extended the QSDI lease to 66 years.\n\nIn 2004, ''Queen Mary'' and Stargazer Productions added Tibbies Great American Cabaret to the space previously occupied by the ship's bank and wireless telegraph room. Stargazer Productions and ''Queen Mary'' transformed the space into a working dinner theatre complete with stage, lights, sound and scullery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tibbiescabaret.com/History.html|title=History|publisher=Tibbies Cabaret|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907104145/http://tibbiescabaret.com/History.html|archivedate=7 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Starboard sun deck of Queen Mary docked in Long Beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Starboard sun deck, 1972]]\n\nIn 2005, QSDI sought [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] protection due to a rent credit dispute with the city. In 2006, the bankruptcy court requested bids from parties interested in taking over the lease from QSDI. The minimum required opening bid was $41M. The operation of the ship, by RMS Foundation, remained independent of the bankruptcy. In summer 2007, ''Queen Mary''{{'s}} lease was sold to a group named \"Save the Queen\", managed by Hostmark Hospitality Group.\n\nThey planned to develop the land adjacent to ''Queen Mary'', and upgrade, renovate and restore the ship. During their management, staterooms were updated with [[iPod]] docking stations and flatscreen TVs and the ship's three funnels and waterline area were repainted their original Cunard Red color. The portside Promenade Deck's planking was restored and refinished. Many lifeboats were repaired and patched, and the ship's kitchens were renovated with new equipment.\n\nIn late September 2009, management of ''Queen Mary'' was taken over by [[Delaware North Companies]], who plan to continue restoration and renovation of the ship and its property. They were determined to revitalise and enhance the ship as an attraction.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://media.delawarenorth.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=689 |title=Delaware North on Board at Queen Mary |publisher=media.delawarenorth.com |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> But in April 2011, The city of Long Beach was informed that Delaware North was no longer managing ''Queen Mary''.
