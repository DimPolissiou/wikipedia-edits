In 1984, the raceway became part of the newly incorporated city of [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]]. Riverside was noted for its hot, dusty environment and for being a somewhat complicated and dangerous track for drivers. It was also considered one of the finest tracks in the United States.<ref name=\"track types-history\">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=C. |title=One of America's finest tracks |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_D4sIFKi02 |website=racingcircuirs.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400,<ref name=\"last race Riverside\">{{cite web |title=Budweiser 400 88 |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1988_Budweiser_400/W |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> won by Rusty Wallace,<ref name=\"R.Wallace Stats\">{{cite web |title=Racing Reference |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Rusty_Wallace |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> held in 1988.

It was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp.. The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a man by the name of Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe. However the building of the raceway met with funding difficulties early on and a businessman by the name of John Edgar provided a much needed cash bailout. This action prevented any halt in the track's construction.<ref name=\"latimes article-rir-history\">{{cite news |last1=Glick |first1=Shav |title=RIR History |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-07/sports/sp-405_1_race-track/4 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |publisher=L.A.Times |date=Aug 7, 1988}}</ref>\n\nThe first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, lost his life.  Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off between Turns 5 and 6 .  With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence's MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track.  Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.<ref name=\"Brain injury cite\">{{cite web |last1=Stahler |first1=Tom |title=First death at RIR |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/the-legend-of-riverside-raceway/ |website=drivingline.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including [[Carroll Shelby]], [[Masten Gregory]] and [[Ken Miles]]. Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named [[Dan Gurney]], who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it. Shelby led early but spun and fell back. Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event. Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won. Gurney's performance caught the eye of North American [[Ferrari]] importer [[Luigi Chinetti]], who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1958, effectively launching the Californian's European career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html|title=Riverside|website=RacingCircuits.info}}</ref>\n\nFootage exists of classic races like the 1986 [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix]] in which the [[Chevy Corvette]] of [[Doc Bundy]], attempting a three-wide pass going into turn 1, hit the [[Ford Probe]] of [[Lyn St. James]] and the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] of [[Chip Robinson]].  St. James' car caught fire and Chip Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd. St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.<ref name=\"3rd parag. cite\">{{cite web |last1=Cider |first1=Frank |title=Riverside International |url=http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html |website=oscarbyalpinestars.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.royhooper.com/gtpcrash.htm Riverside Raceway GTP Crash]</ref>\n\nThe track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end. During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, Indycar great [[A. J. Foyt]] suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed. Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver [[Parnelli Jones]] noticed a twitch of movement. Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight. In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion [http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/lou-sell Dr. Lou Sell] crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns. In January 1967, Canadian driver [[Billy Foster]] crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race. These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html|title=OSCAR by Alpinestars: Riverside International Raceway|first=Frank|last=Sider|date=17 December 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962\u2013'63 NASCAR champion [[Joe Weatherly]], who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely. Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.\n\nNevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] GTP history. In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, [[Rolf Stommelen]]'s Joest-constructed [[Porsche 935]] lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.<ref name=\"gtplanet.net\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/riverside-international-raceway-riverside-california.342098/|title=Riverside International Raceway (Riverside, California)|website=GTPlanet}}</ref>\n\nOf the entire road course races run at RIR, there was one that was run in a counter-clockwise direction, sometime around 1960. In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car's Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system. The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there. From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Indianapolis-car race.<ref name=\"cite\">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Joe |title=MNRL Season 1, Race 6 information- Riverside Int.(Jan 10th) |url=https://cmsracing.com/champion/forums/showthread.php?30510-MNRL-Season-1-Race-6-information-Riverside-Int-(Jan-10th) |website=cmsracing.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[ESPN]] was live for the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through a tire/guardrail barrier and then goes through the fence, destroys a cement barrier before coming to rest near a fence where the fans were sitting on the 32nd lap. He was not injured, though, and neither were the race fans, the red flag was out for 25 minutes and 5 seconds to make repairs to the area by adding 2 [[Jersey barriers]].\n\nAfter 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, [[Richard Childress]] won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when [[Ricky Rudd]] drove his #3 [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, NASCAR's championship race was at Riverside.  The [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969.\n\nRiverside was home to track announcer Sandy Reed and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) [[Roy Hord Jr.]]\n\nNASCAR Team owners [[Roger Penske]] and [[Rick Hendrick]] drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars. Penske won a Winston West race in 1963, while In the final race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let [[Elliott Forbes-Robinson]] take over.\n\nThe [[Winston Western 500]] came to be known as the signature event at the track. Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series#Winston Cup|Winston Cup Series]] season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the [[Daytona 500]]. From 1981-1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season. As of 2019, 1981 is the only year in NASCAR history that Riverside held 3 Cup Series events in a single season (the season opener, The season's halfway point, and the season finale). The reason why Riverside was the season finale for 1981 was because [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] closed after the season ended in 1980.\n\nRiverside also hosted [[drag racing]] events.  Between 1961 and 1969, the [[Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races]], \"one of the most significant drag racing events\" of that era, were held at RIR.<ref>Taylor, Thom.  Untitled item in ''Hot Rod Magazine'', February 2017, p. 11.</ref> The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a [[National Hot Rod Association]] national event prize at the time.<ref>Taylor, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==The Four Courses of Riverside==\nThe track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the type of car and race length. The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course ({{convert|3.27|mi|km}}), the short course ({{convert|2.5|mi|km}}), and the [[NASCAR]] ({{convert|2.62|mi|km}}) course. The original racetrack had a {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch from 1957 to 1968. When the track was redesigned in 1969, Turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the cars' brakes. The fourth track configuration was a [[drag racing]] strip.\n\nBefore a racing event at RIR, track crews added [[traffic cone|traffic pylons]] to close off sections of the track. The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race.\n\nThroughout its history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road and motorcycle events.<ref name=\"various layouts\">{{cite web |last1=Kettle |first1=Tom |title=RIR configurations |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_DQMoFKi00 |website=racingcircuits.info |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Diagram notes''': The long course had the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch between turns 8 & 9. This version was used primarily for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for [[American open-wheel car racing|Indy car racing]] in the mid-1980s. When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching Turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure).<br> In the short course, the track would use turn '''7A''' rather than 8. The \"Turn 7-7A\" configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length.  The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 & 9.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Riverside International Raceway 1980 and 1967.svg|Riverside International Raceway with & without dogleg.\n\nFile:Riverside International Raceway 1980.svg|Riverside International Raceway after the 1969 redesign of the track.\n</gallery>\n\n==Movies and television==\nDue to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.\n\nScenes from the television shows ''[[CHiPs]]'' (used as both a stand in for [[ISM Raceway|Phoenix International Raceway]] and Riverside itself for the episode ''Drive, Lady, Drive''), ''[[Simon and Simon]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', ''[[The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Hardcastle & McCormick]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', and the [[HBO]] program ''[[Super Dave Osborne]]'' were shot on location at RIR. The [[Television film|television movie]] adaptation of ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'', ''Riding With Death'', featured as an experiment on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', also contains footage of racing at Riverside.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xseO3uX9Sv0</ref>\n\nRIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm \"The Quick and the Dead,\" an episode of the series [[Route 66 (TV series)|''Route 66'']]. The episode stars [[Martin Milner]] and [[George Maharis]], and guest stars [[Harvey Korman]], [[Regis Toomey]], and [[Betsy Jones-Moreland]]. Milner races a 1960 powder-blue [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in the film.\n\nFilm shoots at RIR included scenes from:  ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1978) ''[[The Betsy]]'' (1978), ''[[Fireball 500]]'' (1966), ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964),  ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968), ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959), ''[[Roadracers (1959 film)|Roadracers]]'' (1959), ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968), ''[[Stacey (1973 film)|Stacey]]'' (1973), ''[[Thunder Alley (1967 film)|Thunder Alley]]'' (1967), ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' (1969), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964).<ref>{{Citation | last =Rice | first =Jerry | year =2009 | title =Starring Role; Riverside's Location Just Outside Hollywood | periodical =Riverside Magazine | publisher =Fred H. Hamilton | volume =2 | issue =3 | page =26 | issn =}}</ref>\n\n===Use in gaming===\nThe track was used in [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[NASCAR Legends]]'', ''[[NASCAR Heat]]'' and later was converted to ''[[NASCAR 4]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2002 Season]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season|2003]]'' and ''[[rFactor]]''.\n\nRiverside has also been featured in ''[[Indianapolis 500: Evolution]]'' for the Xbox 360 and can be downloaded into rFactor with all 3 options.\n\n==Closure and transformation into a shopping mall==\n\nRIR, headed by former [[Los Angeles Rams]] player [[Les Richter]], sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1971 after American Raceways Inc. (which also owned [[Texas World Speedway]], [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Raceway]], [[Michigan International Speedway]] and [[Trenton Speedway]]) declared bankruptcy. Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR's broadcasting arm [[Motor Racing Network]] plus the raceway's radio network (along with [[Ralph Lawler]]) and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape.\n\nDuring this time, Riverside County and the newly incorporated Moreno Valley area had a growth spurt, new residents started enclosing in on the raceway and became hostile about the raceway's noise levels, furthermore, the land the raceway was on was becoming more and more valuable that the track was almost able to survive (during this time, track president Dan Greenwood, who succeeded Richter in 1983, was trying to search for Riverside's replacement, [[Perris, California|Perris]] and [[Corona, California|Corona]] and with protests from both residents and environmentalists, Riverside was done for).\n\n1988 was the final year of racing for Riverside. On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final Winston Cup race at RIR; the 1988 Budweiser 400 was won by [[Rusty Wallace]] (a caution flag, later red flag,  was out for [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, missing the grandstands, on lap 29), later on [[SCORE International]] held its last race on August 14, 1988. In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7 to near the dogleg after a section of the backstretch and turn 7A near the Bosh Bridge was severed for Towngate Blvd. and Eucalyptus Ave., the modified track was called '''Riverside Regional Raceway''' and continued to be used for club events. After 31 years of racing, Riverside closed on July 2, 1989, with the final Cal-Club event (which, ironically, ended the way it started with the death of racer Mark Verbofsky on July 1, 1989).\n\nDuda (along with [[Homart Development Company]]) turned the \"House that [[Dan Gurney]] built\" into a [[shopping mall]] which opened in 1992. The [[Moreno Valley Mall|Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate]] is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy the southern end of what was the old racetrack (where [[Tim Richmond]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] raced). In a 1994 aerial view of RIR, the remains of Riverside's Turn 9, the original backstretch, the 1969 aligned backstretch from the kink to the entrance to Turn 9, part of the pit entrance and front stretch wall were still visible along with the Administration Building.  However, today nothing is left of RIR except for [[memorabilia]] from the racetrack. The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of townhouses.\n \nNumerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Valley Mall off Frederick Street are named after racers that raced at Riverside, such as [[Cale Yarborough|Yarborough]] Drive, [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]] Place, [[Mark Donohue|Donohue]] Court, [[John Surtees|Surtees]] Court, [[Geoff Brabham|Brabham]] Street, [[Mario Andretti|Andretti]] Street and [[Roger Penske|Penske]] Street.\n\nWhen Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (in nearby [[Ontario, California|Ontario]]), which closed in 1980, and was followed by [[Ascot Park (speedway)|Ascot Park]] in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in 1991.  In the 1990s, two new circuits opened: [[Auto Club Speedway]] in nearby [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] in 1997, and [[Toyota Speedway at Irwindale]] (now the [[Irwindale Event Center]]) in 1999 and is in danger of meeting the same fate as Riverside. Both tracks, like Riverside, have been used for filming.\n\nIn 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up.

In 1984, the raceway became part of the newly incorporated city of [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]]. Riverside was noted for its hot, dusty environment and for being a somewhat complicated and dangerous track for drivers. It was also considered one of the finest tracks in the United States.<ref name=\"track types-history\">{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=C. |title=One of America's finest tracks |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_D4sIFKi02 |website=racingcircuirs.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400,<ref name=\"last race Riverside\">{{cite web |title=Budweiser 400 88 |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1988_Budweiser_400/W |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> won by Rusty Wallace,<ref name=\"R.Wallace Stats\">{{cite web |title=Racing Reference |url=https://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Rusty_Wallace |website=racingreference.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> held in 1988.

It was built in early 1957 by a company called West Coast Automotive Testing Corp.. The head of West Coast Auto Testing was a man by the name of Rudy Cleye, from Los Angeles, who had previously raced in Europe. However the building of the raceway met with funding difficulties early on and a businessman by the name of John Edgar provided a much needed cash bailout. This action prevented any halt in the track's construction.<ref name=\"latimes article-rir-history\">{{cite news |last1=Glick |first1=Shav |title=RIR History |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-07/sports/sp-405_1_race-track/4 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |publisher=L.A.Times |date=Aug 7, 1988}}</ref>\n\nThe first weekend of scheduled races in September 1957, a California Sports Car Club event, John Lawrence of Pasadena, California, lost his life.  Lawrence, a former Cal Club member, piloting a 1500 cc Production champion, went off between Turns 5 and 6 .  With no crash barrier in place, and no rollbar on the car, Lawrence's MGA went up the sand embankment, then rolled back onto the track.  Though Lawrence survived the incident, and appeared only slightly injured, he died later at the hospital of a brain injury.<ref name=\"Brain injury cite\">{{cite web |last1=Stahler |first1=Tom |title=First death at RIR |url=https://www.drivingline.com/articles/the-legend-of-riverside-raceway/ |website=drivingline.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe second major event at the track, in November 1957, was a sports car race featuring some of the top drivers of the day, including [[Carroll Shelby]], [[Masten Gregory]] and [[Ken Miles]]. Another driver entered was an inexperienced local youngster named [[Dan Gurney]], who had been offered the opportunity to drive a powerful but ill-handling 4.9-liter Ferrari after better-known drivers such as Shelby and Miles had rejected it. Shelby led early but spun and fell back. Gurney assumed the lead and led for much of the event. Shelby, driving furiously to catch up, finally overtook Gurney late in the race and won. Gurney's performance caught the eye of North American [[Ferrari]] importer [[Luigi Chinetti]], who arranged for Gurney to drive a factory-supported Ferrari at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] in 1958, effectively launching the Californian's European career.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html|title=Riverside|website=RacingCircuits.info}}</ref>\n\nFootage exists of classic races like the 1986 [[Los Angeles Times Grand Prix]] in which the [[Chevy Corvette]] of [[Doc Bundy]], attempting a three-wide pass, hit the [[Ford Probe]] of [[Lyn St. James]] and the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] of [[Chip Robinson]] at Turn 1. St. James' car caught fire and Chip Robinson nearly cartwheeled into the crowd. St. James survived the flames and Robinson escaped uninjured within the track bounds.<ref name=\"3rd parag. cite\">{{cite web |last1=Cider |first1=Frank |title=Riverside International |url=http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html |website=oscarbyalpinestars.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.royhooper.com/gtpcrash.htm Riverside Raceway GTP Crash]</ref>\n\nThe track was known as a relatively dangerous course, with its long, downhill back straightaway and brake-destroying, relatively slow 180-degree Turn 9 at the end. During the 1965 Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race, Indycar great [[A. J. Foyt]] suffered a brake failure at the end of the straight, shot off the road and went end-over-end through the infield at high speed. Crash crews assumed Foyt was dead at the scene, until fellow driver [[Parnelli Jones]] noticed a twitch of movement. Ford factory sports car driver Ken Miles was killed there in a testing accident in August 1966 when his Ford sports car prototype (known as the J-car) became aerodynamically unstable and flew out of control at the end of the back straight. In December 1968, American Formula 5000 champion [http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/lou-sell Dr. Lou Sell] crashed and overturned in Turn 9 on the first lap of the Rex Mays 300 Indianapolis-style race, suffering near-fatal burns. In January 1967, Canadian driver [[Billy Foster]] crashed at Turn 9 during a practice-session just prior to the start of qualifying for the Motor Trend 500 NASCAR race. These accidents and others caused track management to reconfigure Turn 9, giving the turn a dogleg approach and a much wider radius (a water improvement also closed the raceway for a few months).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscarbyalpinestars.blogspot.com/2009/12/riverside-international-raceway.html|title=OSCAR by Alpinestars: Riverside International Raceway|first=Frank|last=Sider|date=17 December 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1964, Riverside also claimed the life of 1962\u2013'63 NASCAR champion [[Joe Weatherly]], who refused to wear a shoulder harness and wore his lap belt loosely. Weatherly died when he lost control entering Turn 6, hitting the steel barrier almost broadside and had his head snapped out the window against the barrier.\n\nNevertheless, in 1983 Turn 9 was the site of the only fatality in [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] GTP history. In the 1983 Times Grand Prix, [[Rolf Stommelen]]'s Joest-constructed [[Porsche 935]] lost its rear wing at the Dogleg and hit two freeway-type barriers sending it into a horrific roll at Turn 9.<ref name=\"gtplanet.net\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/riverside-international-raceway-riverside-california.342098/|title=Riverside International Raceway (Riverside, California)|website=GTPlanet}}</ref>\n\nOf the entire road course races run at RIR, there was one that was run in a counter-clockwise direction, sometime around 1960. In 1966 Dan Gurney tested his first Eagle racing car on a shorter, counter-clockwise version of the track tailored specifically for his car's Indianapolis-specific left-turn oiling system. The test caused Gurney to ask track president Les Richter to hold an Indianapolis-style race there. From 1967 to 1969 the Rex Mays 300 served as the season-ending [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Indianapolis-car race.<ref name=\"cite\">{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Joe |title=MNRL Season 1, Race 6 information- Riverside Int.(Jan 10th) |url=https://cmsracing.com/champion/forums/showthread.php?30510-MNRL-Season-1-Race-6-information-Riverside-Int-(Jan-10th) |website=cmsracing.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[ESPN]] was live for the June 12, 1988, Budweiser 400 race at RIR and caught racer [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] crashing hard off turn 9 and his car went through a tire/guardrail barrier and then goes through the fence, destroys a cement barrier before coming to rest near a fence where the fans were sitting on the 32nd lap. He was not injured, though, and neither were the race fans, the red flag was out for 25 minutes and 5 seconds to make repairs to the area by adding 2 [[Jersey barriers]].\n\nAfter 14 years of NASCAR as a driver and later a car owner, [[Richard Childress]] won his first NASCAR race in 1983, when [[Ricky Rudd]] drove his #3 [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont Airlines]] Chevrolet to victory in the 1983 Budweiser 400k.\n\nFrom 1981 until 1987, NASCAR's championship race was at Riverside.  The [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Championship Trail also held their season ending race from 1967 to 1969.\n\nRiverside was home to track announcer Sandy Reed and (along with former LA Rams player Les Richter) [[Roy Hord Jr.]]\n\nNASCAR Team owners [[Roger Penske]] and [[Rick Hendrick]] drove a select few races at Riverside in their own cars. Penske won a Winston West race in 1963, while In the final race in 1988, Hendrick got out of the car and let [[Elliott Forbes-Robinson]] take over.\n\nThe [[Winston Western 500]] came to be known as the signature event at the track. Initially (1963-1981) this race was held in January as the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series#Winston Cup|Winston Cup Series]] season opener, but beginning in 1982 NASCAR elected to start the season with the [[Daytona 500]]. From 1981-1987 the Winston Western 500 was held in November as the final race of the season. As of 2019, 1981 is the only year in NASCAR history that Riverside held 3 Cup Series events in a single season (the season opener, The season's halfway point, and the season finale). The reason why Riverside was the season finale for 1981 was because [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] closed after the season ended in 1980.\n\nRiverside also hosted [[drag racing]] events.  Between 1961 and 1969, the [[Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races]], \"one of the most significant drag racing events\" of that era, were held at RIR.<ref>Taylor, Thom.  Untitled item in ''Hot Rod Magazine'', February 2017, p. 11.</ref> The championship offered a US$37,000 prize, greater even than a [[National Hot Rod Association]] national event prize at the time.<ref>Taylor, p. 11.</ref>\n\n==The Four Courses of Riverside==\nThe track was built to accommodate several different configurations, depending on the type of car and race length. The three options on Riverside Raceway were the long course ({{convert|3.27|mi|km}}), the short course ({{convert|2.5|mi|km}}), and the [[NASCAR]] ({{convert|2.62|mi|km}}) course. The original racetrack had a {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch from 1957 to 1968. When the track was redesigned in 1969, Turn 9 was reconfigured with a wider radius and banked with a dogleg approach added, to reduce strain on the cars' brakes. The fourth track configuration was a [[drag racing]] strip.\n\nBefore a racing event at RIR, track crews added [[traffic cone|traffic pylons]] to close off sections of the track. The closed sections were determined by the specific course and cars used during any given race.\n\nThroughout its history, various other track configurations were used to adapt the track for events such as off-road and motorcycle events.<ref name=\"various layouts\">{{cite web |last1=Kettle |first1=Tom |title=RIR configurations |url=http://www.racingcircuits.info/north-america/usa/riverside.html#.W_DQMoFKi00 |website=racingcircuits.info |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Diagram notes''': The long course had the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} backstretch between turns 8 & 9. This version was used primarily for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Grand Prix, although the long course was also used for [[American open-wheel car racing|Indy car racing]] in the mid-1980s. When the 1969 version was built, the dogleg was added so as to ease the transition into Turn 9 (the track had seen numerous brake failure-induced accidents approaching Turn 9, and this change was made as a safety measure).<br> In the short course, the track would use turn '''7A''' rather than 8. The \"Turn 7-7A\" configuration effectively shortened the back straight to just over one-half mile in length.  The NHRA drag strip ran south to north on the backstretch from the runoff to the Bosch Bridge (not shown in diagram), which crossed over the track about halfway between turns 8 & 9.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Riverside International Raceway 1980 and 1967.svg|Riverside International Raceway with & without dogleg.\n\nFile:Riverside International Raceway 1980.svg|Riverside International Raceway after the 1969 redesign of the track.\n</gallery>\n\n==Movies and television==\nDue to its proximity to the Southern California entertainment industry, RIR was a frequent filming location for Hollywood movies, television series and commercials.\n\nScenes from the television shows ''[[CHiPs]]'' (used as both a stand in for [[ISM Raceway|Phoenix International Raceway]] and Riverside itself for the episode ''Drive, Lady, Drive''), ''[[Simon and Simon]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', ''[[The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Hardcastle & McCormick]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', and the [[HBO]] program ''[[Super Dave Osborne]]'' were shot on location at RIR. The [[Television film|television movie]] adaptation of ''[[Gemini Man (TV series)|Gemini Man]]'', ''Riding With Death'', featured as an experiment on the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', also contains footage of racing at Riverside.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xseO3uX9Sv0</ref>\n\nRIR was extensively featured in the 1961 telefilm \"The Quick and the Dead,\" an episode of the series [[Route 66 (TV series)|''Route 66'']]. The episode stars [[Martin Milner]] and [[George Maharis]], and guest stars [[Harvey Korman]], [[Regis Toomey]], and [[Betsy Jones-Moreland]]. Milner races a 1960 powder-blue [[Chevrolet Corvette]] in the film.\n\nFilm shoots at RIR included scenes from:  ''[[Good Guys Wear Black]]'' (1978) ''[[The Betsy]]'' (1978), ''[[Fireball 500]]'' (1966), ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964),  ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968), ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959), ''[[Roadracers (1959 film)|Roadracers]]'' (1959), ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968), ''[[Stacey (1973 film)|Stacey]]'' (1973), ''[[Thunder Alley (1967 film)|Thunder Alley]]'' (1967), ''[[Winning (film)|Winning]]'' (1969), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964).<ref>{{Citation | last =Rice | first =Jerry | year =2009 | title =Starring Role; Riverside's Location Just Outside Hollywood | periodical =Riverside Magazine | publisher =Fred H. Hamilton | volume =2 | issue =3 | page =26 | issn =}}</ref>\n\n===Use in gaming===\nThe track was used in [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s ''[[NASCAR Legends]]'', ''[[NASCAR Heat]]'' and later was converted to ''[[NASCAR 4]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2002 Season]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season|2003]]'' and ''[[rFactor]]''.\n\nRiverside has also been featured in ''[[Indianapolis 500: Evolution]]'' for the Xbox 360.\n\n==Closure and transformation into a shopping mall==\n\nRIR, headed by former [[Los Angeles Rams]] player [[Les Richter]], sold the property to real estate developer Fritz Duda in 1971 after American Raceways Inc. (which also owned [[Texas World Speedway]], [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta International Raceway]], [[Michigan International Speedway]] and [[Trenton Speedway]]) declared bankruptcy. Duda had once been a turn announcer for NASCAR's broadcasting arm [[Motor Racing Network]] plus the raceway's radio network (along with [[Ralph Lawler]]) and many felt racing would long be a part of the Riverside landscape.\n\nDuring this time, Riverside County and the newly incorporated Moreno Valley area had a growth spurt, new residents started enclosing in on the raceway and became hostile about the raceway's noise levels, furthermore, the land the raceway was on was becoming more and more valuable that the track was almost able to survive (during this time, track president Dan Greenwood, whom succeeded Richter in 1983, was trying to search for Riverside's replacement, [[Perris, California|Perris]] and [[Corona, California|Corona]] and with protests from both residents and environmentalists, Riverside was done for).\n\n1988 was the final year of racing for Riverside. On June 12, 1988, NASCAR held its final Winston Cup race at RIR; the 1988 Budweiser 400 was won by [[Rusty Wallace]] (a caution flag was out for [[Ruben Garcia (NASCAR driver)|Ruben Garcia]] when he came off Turn 9 and lost control of his car and hit a wall, missing the grandstands, on lap 29), later on [[SCORE International]] held its last race on August 14, 1988. In 1989, the track was modified from turn 7 to near the dogleg after a section of the backstretch and turn 7A near the Bosh Bridge was severed for Towngate Blvd. and Eucalyptus Ave., the modified track was called '''Riverside Regional Raceway''' and continued to be used for club events. After 31 years of racing, Riverside closed on July 2, 1989, with the final Cal-Club event (which, ironically, ended the way it started with the death of racer Mark Verbofsky on July 1, 1989).\n\nDuda (along with [[Homart Development Company]]) turned the \"House that [[Dan Gurney]] built\" into a [[shopping mall]] which opened in 1992. The [[Moreno Valley Mall|Moreno Valley Mall at Towngate]] is on the northern end of the former raceway property and homes now occupy the southern end of what was the old racetrack (where [[Tim Richmond]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] raced). In a 1994 aerial view of RIR, the remains of Riverside's Turn 9, the original backstretch, the 1969 aligned backstretch from the kink to the entrance to Turn 9, part of the pit entrance and front stretch wall were still visible along with the Administration Building.  However, today nothing is left of RIR except for [[memorabilia]] from the racetrack. The old Administration Building remained until 2005, when it was torn down to make way for a complex of townhouses.\n \nNumerous streets in the neighborhood to the east of the Moreno Valley Mall off Frederick Street are named after racers that raced at Riverside, such as [[Cale Yarborough|Yarborough]] Drive, [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]] Place, [[Mark Donohue|Donohue]] Court, [[John Surtees|Surtees]] Court, [[Geoff Brabham|Brabham]] Street, [[Mario Andretti|Andretti]] Street and [[Roger Penske|Penske]] Street.\n\nWhen Riverside closed in 1989, it followed in the footsteps of [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] (in nearby [[Ontario, California|Ontario]]), which closed in 1980, and was followed by [[Ascot Park (speedway)|Ascot Park]] in [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in 1991.  In the 1990s, two new circuits opened: [[Auto Club Speedway]] in nearby [[Fontana, California|Fontana]] in 1997, and [[Toyota Speedway at Irwindale]] (now the [[Irwindale Event Center]]) in 1999 and is in danger of meeting the same fate as Riverside. Both tracks, like Riverside, have been used for filming.\n\nIn 2003, the remainder of the old Riverside International Raceway was torn up. The sign that was at [[California State Route 60|State Route 60]] and Day Street was removed to make way for both a [[Lowe's]] warehouse and a new pair of on/off ramps and Turn 9 of the old track is now home to houses.\n\nIn 2003, plans were announced to build a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} road course with a similar design to the famed Riverside layout in [[Merced, California]].  The track would have been known as the [[Riverside Motorsports Park]], but the project was abandoned in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mercedsunstar.com/167/story/967136.html=Merced|title=Riverside Motorsports Park CEO says plan for track is dead|date=2009-07-24|author=Reilly, Corinne}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Fatalities at Riverside==\nFrom September 21, 1957, to July 2, 1989, 21 people died (19 drivers, 1 spectator and 1 pit crew member) in the track's 31-year history:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* John Lawrence (Sept. 21, 1957)\n* Pedro van Dory (April 3, 1960)\n* Bruce Johnson (Aug. 21, 1961)\n* Pete Hessler (March 11, 1962)\n* Pat Pigott (Oct. 14, 1962)\n* Stuart Dane Feb. 2, 1963)\n* [[Joe Weatherly]] (Jan. 19, 1964)\n* George Koehne Jr. Oct. 11, 1964)\n* Jim Ladd (Nov. 15, 1964)\n* Ronald Pickle (spectator) (Jan. 17, 1965)\n* [[Ken Miles]] (Aug. 17, 1966)\n* [[Billy Foster]] (Jan. 20, 1967)\n* Vic Tandy (Jan. 27, 1968)\n* Mel Andrus (April 25, 1971)\n* Bill Spencer (Jan. 18, 1975)\n* Lynwood \"Sonny\" Easly and Douglas Grunst (pit crewman) (Jan. 15, 1978)\n* Tim Williamson (Jan. 12, 1980)\n* [[Rolf Stommelen]] (April 24, 1983)\n* John Goss (Oct. 17, 1983)\n* Mark Verbofsky (July 1, 1989)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Races held at Riverside International Raceway==\n[[File:Riverside Raceway by deviantmike423.png|thumb|NASCAR in the esses at RIR 1983.]]\n*The NASCAR [[NEXTEL Cup|Winston Cup Series]] and Winston West: Motor Trend 500, NASCAR [[Winston Western 500]], and [[Budweiser 400|NAPA/Budweiser 400K]] (The Cup and West series raced together in those races.)\n*The [[Champ Car|PPG Indy Car World Series]]: [[Air California|AirCal 500]] / L.A.

Ustro\u0144 as a municipality was subscribed to the [[Districts of Austria|political district]] of [[Bielsko]] and the [[legal district]] of [[Skocz\u00f3w]]. In 1856, it gained market town rights. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 4375 in 1880 to 4275 in 1910, with a majority being native Polish-speakers (91.5\u201392.8%), a growing minority speaking German (from 267 or 6.2% in 1880 to 333 or 7.8% in 1910), and dwindling Czech-speaking population (99 or 2.3% in 1880 to 15 or 0.4% in 1910). In terms of religion, the majority were [[Protestants]] (57.1% in 1910), followed by [[Roman Catholics]] (40.4% in 1910) and [[Jews]] (107 or 2.5% in 1910).<ref>{{cite book | last = Pi\u0105tkowski | first = Kazimierz | title = Stosunki narodowo\u015bciowe w Ksi\u0119stwie Cieszy\u0144skiem | publisher = Macierz Szkolna Ksi\u0119stwa Cieszy\u0144skiego | year = 1918 | location = Cieszyn | pages = 260, 279 | language = Polish |url = http://obc.opole.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=1076 }}</ref><ref>Ludwig Patryn (ed): ''[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=11734&from=&dirids=110&ver_id=667518&lp=1&QI=88775AF9984FF398CDB8D74B3F93EEB0-1 Die Ergebnisse der Volksz\u00e4hlung vom 31.

It was then [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed]] by [[Nazi Germany]] at the beginning of [[World War II]]. After the war it was restored to [[Poland]].\n\nIt gained city rights in 1956. Since the 1960s it saw a large development of new hotels and health centers. A cluster of [[pyramid]]-shaped hotels were built in the town. It was also expanded by merger of the surrounding villages: [[Nierodzim]] in 1974, [[Hermanice, Ustro\u0144|Hermanice]] and [[Lipowiec, Ustro\u0144|Lipowiec]] in 1975.\n\n==Sport==\n* Ku\u017ania Ustro\u0144 \u2013 football club founded in 1922\n* TRS Si\u0142a Ustro\u0144 \u2013 volleyball club\n\n==Education==\n* The Alfred Meissner Graduated School of Dental Engineering and the Humanities\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Karol H\u0142awiczka]] (1894-1976), composer and educator\n*[[Theodor Kotschy]] (1813\u20131866), Austrian botanist\n*[[Jan Szwarc]] (born 1946), politician\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Poland}}\nUstro\u0144 is [[Sister city|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Miasta partnerskie|url=https://ustron.pl/k/miasto/miasta_partnerskie|website=ustron.pl|publisher=Ustro\u0144|language=pl|accessdate=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Fren\u0161t\u00e1t pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm]], Czech Republic\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Hajd\u00fan\u00e1n\u00e1s]], Hungary\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Kalety]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Luha\u010dovice]], Czech Republic\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Neukirchen-Vluyn]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|SVK}} [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]], Slovakia\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[\u00dajbuda|\u00dajbuda (Budapest)]], Hungary\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Gmina Ustronie Morskie|Ustronie Morskie]], Poland\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly accessible places (such as parks or open moorland) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes usually contain a logbook and a rubber stamp.\n[[File:Geocaching.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Geocaching|Geocache]] in Germany]]\n[[Geocaching]] is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a global positioning system (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called \"geocaches\" or \"caches\").\n\nThe treasure hunt as a party game is attributed to socialite [[Elsa Maxwell]].

This type of treasure hunt may take months to solve and often has large prizes to be won. An early example of the genre is [[Kit Williams]]' 1979 book ''[[Masquerade (book)|Masquerade]]''.\n\nIn 1956, comedian [[Jan Murray]] created and hosted a variation for television, also known as ''[[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|Treasure Hunt]]''. This US game show featured a pair of contestants answering questions to qualify to go on a treasure hunt that involved choosing from among thirty treasure chests that included anything from gag prizes to valuable merchandise and/or cash. The show also offered home viewers a chance of a treasure hunt, when a postcard was chosen from a large drum by a young guest who revolved the drum several times to randomise the entries. The show aired daily in the morning and once a week in the evening until 1959, when the networks began canceling game shows in the wake of the [[quiz show scandal]].\n\nIn 2012, the [[Guinness World Records]] title for 'most participants in a treasure hunt game' was set by Team London Ambassadors, who broke the previous record (of 308 participants) in [[London]]. 466 Participants, all [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Ambassadors for the Olympic and Paralympic Games]], worked in 93 teams of five, each completing a set of twelve clues hidden on either side of the [[River Thames]], starting and finishing at [[City Hall, London]].

Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly accessible places (such as parks or open moorland) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes usually contain a logbook and a rubber stamp.\n[[File:Geocaching.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Geocaching|Geocache]] in Germany]]\n[[Geocaching]] is an outdoor treasure-hunting game in which the participants use a global positioning system (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called \"geocaches\" or \"caches\").\n\nThe treasure hunt as a party game is attributed to socialite [[Elsa Maxwell]]. She said{{when|date=June 2016}} that \"In the Treasure Hunt . . . intellectual men were paired off with great beauties, glamor with talent. In the course of the night's escapades anything could happen.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,796902-2,00.html Time article ''Elsa at War''] retrieved April 10, 2007</ref>\n\nAn \"armchair treasure hunt\" is an activity that requires solving [[Puzzle|puzzles]] or [[Riddle|riddles]] in some easily portable and widely reproduced format (often{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} an illustrated children's book), and then using clues hidden either in the story or in the graphics of the book to find a real treasure somewhere in the physical world. This type of treasure hunt may take months to solve and often has large prizes to be won. An early example of the genre is [[Kit Williams]]' 1979 book ''[[Masquerade (book)|Masquerade]]''.\n\nIn 1956, comedian [[Jan Murray]] created and hosted a variation for television, also known as ''[[Treasure Hunt (U.S. game show)|Treasure Hunt]]''. This US game show featured a pair of contestants answering questions to qualify to go on a treasure hunt that involved choosing from among thirty treasure chests that included anything from gag prizes to valuable merchandise and/or cash. The show also offered home viewers a chance of a treasure hunt, when a postcard was chosen from a large drum by a young guest who revolved the drum several times to randomise the entries. The show aired daily in the morning and once a week in the evening until 1959, when the networks began canceling game shows in the wake of the [[quiz show scandal]].\n\nIn 2012, the [[Guinness World Records]] title for 'most participants in a treasure hunt game' was set by Team London Ambassadors, who broke the previous record (of 308 participants) in [[London]]. 466 Participants, all [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Ambassadors for the Olympic and Paralympic Games]], worked in 93 teams of five, each completing a set of twelve clues hidden on either side of the [[River Thames]], starting and finishing at [[City Hall, London]].

Participants can win prizes for correctly solving puzzles to win treasure hunts. The first internet hunt was developed in 1992 by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]] to encourage people to explore the resources available online.  Several feature films and television series have used online scavenger hunts as [[viral marketing]], including ''[[The Da Vinci Code WebQuests#The Google WebQuest|The Da Vinci Code]]'' and the [[Sci-Fi Channel]]'s series ''[[The Lost Room]]''.<ref>[http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2006/11/22/win-5-m-in-lost-room-hunt/ \"Win $5 M in Lost Room Hunt\"], Slice of SciFi.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city's downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick. This rebuilding phase was referred to as \"the Limestone Revolution\" and earned the city the nickname \"The Limestone City\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront |title=Fire and gunpowder explosions demolished Kingston's waterfront |newspaper=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 8, 2010 |archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072604/http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront|accessdate=December 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history Kingston Public Market History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619042910/http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history |date=June 19, 2015 }} Retrieved October 8, 2015</ref><ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;99</ref>\n\n===More recent developments===\n\nThe [[Canadian Locomotive Company]] was at one time the largest locomotive works in the British Empire and the Davis [[Tanning (leather)|Tannery]] was at one time the largest tannery in the British Empire.

Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre.

In 2013, Kingston hosted the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the national women's curling championship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thewhig.com/news/local-news/its-official-brier-coming-to-kingston-in-2020 |title=The Kingston Whig-Standard \u2013 November 1, 2018 |access-date=November 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106092823/https://www.thewhig.com/news/local-news/its-official-brier-coming-to-kingston-in-2020 |archive-date=November 6, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Rugby===\nThe Kingston Panthers Rugby Football Club (KPRFC) was founded in 1959, and from that moment onward has established a reputation as a strong community player. KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the [[Ontario Rugby Union]] (ORU), and [[Rugby Canada]] (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015. It is a non-profit organization, a member of the [[Ontario Volleyball Association]] (OVA), [[Volleyball Canada]] (VC). The club relies on [[fundraising]] in order to operate.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Kingston, Ontario}}\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Kingston, Ontario}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cartwright Point, Ontario]]\n* [[Inner Harbour, Kingston]]\n* [[Sydenham Ward]]\n* [[Kingston Mills]]\n* [[Portsmouth, Kingston]]\n* [[Rideau Heights, Kingston]]\n* [[Royal eponyms in Canada]]\n* {{HMCS|Kingston|MM 700}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* Adams, Nick.[http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/publications/pdf/oa46-1-adams.pdf  ''Iroquois Settlement at Fort Frontenac in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries''].

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]].\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]].\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.
