She first appears in one of Hinduism's earliest texts, the [[Rig Veda]], in which she helps the king of the gods [[Indra]] to recover divine cows stolen by the [[Panis]], a class of demons. This legend is alluded to in many later texts, and Sarama is often associated with Indra.  The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', and some ''[[Puranas]]'', also make brief reference to Sarama.\n\nEarly Rig-Vedic works do not depict Sarama as a dog, but later [[Vedic mythology|Vedic mythologies and interpretations]] usually do. She is described as the mother of all dogs, in particular of the two four-eyed [[brindle]] dogs of the god [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], and dogs are given the [[matronymic]] ''Sarameya'' (\"offspring of Sarama\"). One scripture further describes Sarama as the mother of all wild animals.\n\n==Etymology and epithets==\nOrientalist [[Max M\u00fcller]] suggests that the word ''Sarama'' may mean \"the runner\", with the stem originating from the Sanskrit root ''sar'' (\"to go\"), but he is unable to  account for the second part of the name, ''ama''.<ref>M\u00fcller p. 482</ref> Professor [[Monier-Williams]] translates ''Sarama'' as \"the fleet one\".<ref name = \"monier\">[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw1182-sayoni.jpg Monier-Williams Dictionary p. 1182]</ref> The etymological treatise ''[[Nirukta]]'' by [[Yaska]] mentions that Sarama derives her name from her quick movement.

In the legend a group of [[Asura]]s (\"demons\") named [[Panis]] kidnap the cattle tended by the ''Angirasa''s \u2013 the ancestors of man, who were the sons of the sage [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]]. The Panis then hide the cows in a cave, until Sarama follows the tracks of the thieves and helps [[Indra]] to recover them. Sarama is described to have found the cows \"by the path of truth\".<ref name=\"pike\"/> She does this on the bidding of either Indra, [[Brihaspati]], or a combination of Indra and the ''Angirasa''s, as narrated in the variants of the legend. Sarama is described to have found the milk of the cattle, which nourished humanity. This is interpreted as Sarama teaching man to milk cows and use the butter created from it for fire-sacrifices. Sarama also finds food for her own young in the robbers' hide-out. However, in the thanks-giving sacrifice the ''Angirasa''s hold for the gods after the recovery of the cattle, Sarama is neither given sacrifice nor invoked. Sarama's children, ''Sarameya''s, are white with tawny limbs. They are described as common watchdogs, who can not distinguish between Indra's worshippers and the robbers. As a messenger of Indra, Sarama is depicted in the [[Mandala 10|tenth Mandala]] (10.108) as having a conversation with a group of Panis, in which the Panis even tempt her to share their booty and be their sister, although Sarama refuses.<ref name=\"pike\">{{cite book|last=Pike|first=Albert|title=Indo-Aryan Deities and Worship \u2013 As Contained in the Rig Veda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=No7axsiT_9oC&pg=PA350&dq=sarama#v=onepage&q=sarama&f=false|year=1930|pages=350\u20138|isbn=9781443722278}}</ref><ref name = \"aurobindo\"/><ref>M\u00fcller pp. 482\u20133</ref><ref name = \"Singh\">Singh pp. 144\u2013153</ref> Sarama ''Deva-shuni'' is regarded as the author of her speech in this hymn.<ref name = \"monier\"/><ref name = \"Singh\"/> The 3rd century BCE text ''Sarvanukaramani'' of [[Katyayana]] also mentions the Panis' offer to Sarama and her refusal.<ref>Singh p. 165-6</ref>\n\nSarama is also mentioned in a few Vedic hymns, usually in connection with the ''Angirasa''s and the winning of the highest realms of existence, the most important of which is the ''[[Sukta]]'' of the Atris (5.45.8).

So Sarama created water to sustain food and led the water to flow in fields. She also found the divine cows, who provided milk to mankind.<ref>Singh pp. 155\u20136</ref> Yaska's ''Nirukta'' also records the story of the dialogue between Sarama and the Panis, and the story of the recovery of the cows, with his commentator, Durgacharya, filling in details in Sarama's tale later.<ref name = \"Singh158\"/>\n\n===Brhaddevata and related versions===\nIn the ''[[Brhaddevata]]'' of the Rig Vedic legend, composed around 400 BCE, Sarama is less faithful to Indra than in the original. When the Panis steal the cows of Indra, Indra sends Sarama to them as an envoy. The Panis try to lure Sarama to their side and offer her to share their steal. Sarama refuses but asks for the milk of the cows. The Panis grant her the wish, and, after drinking the excellent demonic milk, Sarama returns to Indra, who questions her about the cows. Sarama, under influence of the milk, pretends ignorance. Agitated, Indra kicks her and she vomits the milk. Frightened, she leads Indra to the cave, who then slaughters the Panis and recovers the cows.<ref name = \"Wendy\">{{cite book| last=Doniger|first=Wendy|authorlink=Wendy Doniger|title=Hindu myths: a sourcebook|year=1975|publisher=Penguin Classics|pages=72\u20133}}</ref> A similar account also appears in the ''[[Varaha Purana]]''. The demons seize control of Heaven from Indra, who is advised to organize a cow sacrifice to regain control. The cows of the world are gathered for the ceremony and Sarama is put in charge of them. The demons, however, seize the cows and bribe Sarama with their milk, leaving her alone in the woods. Trembling with fear, Sarama goes to Indra and tells him that she did not know what happened to the cows. The [[Maruts]], who are deputed by Indra to protect Sarama, witness Sarama's treachery and report it to Indra. Indra kicks Sarama in the stomach and she throws up the milk. Sarama then leads Indra to the demons, who are killed by him. Indra then completes his sacrifice and becomes the king of heaven again.<ref name=\"Mani\">{{rp|859}}<ref name = \"epic\"/>\n\n==Parentage and children==\nThe ''Taittiriya [[Aranyaka]]'' states Sarama is a ''vedi'' \u2013 a holy altar, daughter of [[Dyaus]] (\"Heaven\") and [[Prithvi]] (\"Earth\"), and the sister of Brihaspati and [[Rudra]].<ref>Singh pp. 156\u20137</ref>\n\nIn a late hymn in the tenth ''Mandala'' of the Rig Veda, two ''Sarameya'' (literally, \"sons of Sarama\"), Shyama and Sabala, are described without an explicit reference to Sarama as their mother. They are four-eyed and brindled; messengers of [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of the Law in the Vedas and later the god of death. They are guardians to the path of heaven, protecting man on their path.<ref name=\"Mani\">{{rp|859}}<ref name=\"aurobindo\"/> A hymn in the ''Paraskara [[Kalpa_(Vedanga)#Grhya_Sutras|Grihya Sutra]]'' says that Shyama and Sabala are sons of Sarama, their father Sisara. In a spell called ''Ekagni-kanda'', intended to drive away the Dog-spirits (''sav-graha'') like Shyama, Sabala, Alaba, Rji etc. which cause cough in children, Sarama is mentioned as their mother. Sarama's spying on the cows is mentioned, with Indra giving her the right to pester children in return.<ref>Singh pp. 157\u20138</ref>\n \nOften described as the mother of all dogs, she is also sometimes regarded as the mother of all beasts of prey, including lions and tigers, as in ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.<ref name = \"monier\"/> She is also a daughter of [[Daksha]] in this Purana and not a dog.<ref>[http://vedabase.net/sb/6/6/24-26/ Bhaktivedanta VedaBase: \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 6.6.24\u201326] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712011112/http://vedabase.net/sb/6/6/24-26/ |date=2010-07-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Epics==\n[[File:00005 Janamejaya and brothers.jpg|right|thumb|King Janamejaya's brothers beat up a dog \u2013 son of Sarama, who curses the king in return]]\nThe epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' does not mention Sarama herself.

She may be a fair-footed goddess to whom the Panis are attracted and whom they ask to be their sister. It is only in later interpretations of the Vedic imagery that Sarama becomes a divine hound, who sniffs out the Panis and leads her master to them. According to Sri Aurobindo, the phrase in which Sarama demands food for her progeny is misinterpreted with equating Sarama's children to a dog-race born of Sarama. It is the reference to the Sarameya dogs \u2013 sons of Sarama \u2013 in a late hymn that cements the notion of Sarama being a dog.<ref name = \"aurobindo\"/><ref name = \"Wendy\"/><ref>Singh p. 143</ref>\n\nThe role of Sarama in the Rig Vedic legend leads Sri Aurobindo to say, \"Sarama is some power of Light and probably of Dawn\". She \"must be a forerunner of the dawn of Truth in the human mind\". Sarama is \"the traveller and the seeker who does not herself possess [the Truth] but rather finds what is lost\".<ref name = \"aurobindo\"/> Max M\u00fcller relates Sarama to the Ushas, the Dawn. The tale of kidnapping of the cows and their recovery, he explains, is the disappearance of the bright cows or rays of the Sun. Sarama, the Dawn, finds them and is followed by Indra, the god of light.<ref>M\u00fcller pp. 487\u2013491</ref> \n\nWhen explaining the two references in which Sarama follows the \"path of Truth\", Sayana calls Sarama the heavenly dog or Speech ([[V\u0101c]]) herself.<ref name = \"Singh\"/> The Vac-identity of Sarama is also emphasized in the ''Yajus-samhita''s and by Mahidhara, commentator of the ''Vajasaneyi Samhita''.<ref name = \"Singh158\"/> The ''Brhaddevata'', which speaks of Sarama's unfaithfulness, also mentions Sarama as one of the names of Vac in the middle sphere (world), where Vac is said to have three forms in three spheres.

The ''Atharvaveda Samhita'' has another reference to Sarama, which talks about her dew-claws, suggesting her place as deity for all dogs.<ref>Singh pp. 153\u20135</ref>\n\nThe [[Brahmana]] texts like ''[[Taittiriya Shakha|Taittiriya Brahmana]]'' and ''[[Apastamba]] [[Shrautasutra#.C5.9Arauta_Sutras|Shrauta Sutra]]'' narrate that Sarama, the \"goddess in guise of a dog\", was deputed by Indra to roam in the mortal world, where she saw starving people. So Sarama created water to sustain food and led the water to flow in fields. She also found the divine cows, who provided milk to mankind.<ref>Singh pp. 155\u20136</ref> Yaska's ''Nirukta'' also records the story of the dialogue between Sarama and the Panis, and the story of the recovery of the cows, with his commentator, Durgacharya, filling in details in Sarama's tale later.<ref name = \"Singh158\"/>\n\n===Brhaddevata and related versions===\nIn the ''[[Brhaddevata]]'' of the Rig Vedic legend, composed around 400 BCE, Sarama is less faithful to Indra than in the original. When the Panis steal the cows of Indra, Indra sends Sarama to them as an envoy. The Panis try to lure Sarama to their side and offer her to share their steal. Sarama refuses but asks for the milk of the cows. The Panis grant her the wish, and, after drinking the excellent demonic milk, Sarama returns to Indra, who questions her about the cows. Sarama, under influence of the milk, pretends ignorance. Agitated, Indra kicks her and she vomits the milk. Frightened, she leads Indra to the cave, who then slaughters the Panis and recovers the cows.<ref name = \"Wendy\">{{cite book| last=Doniger|first=Wendy|authorlink=Wendy Doniger|title=Hindu myths: a sourcebook|year=1975|publisher=Penguin Classics|pages=72\u20133}}</ref> A similar account also appears in the ''[[Varaha Purana]]''. The demons seize control of Heaven from Indra, who is advised to organize a cow sacrifice to regain control. The cows of the world are gathered for the ceremony and Sarama is put in charge of them. The demons, however, seize the cows and bribe Sarama with their milk, leaving her alone in the woods. Trembling with fear, Sarama goes to Indra and tells him that she did not know what happened to the cows. The [[Maruts]], who are deputed by Indra to protect Sarama, witness Sarama's treachery and report it to Indra. Indra kicks Sarama in the stomach and she throws up the milk. Sarama then leads Indra to the demons, who are killed by him. Indra then completes his sacrifice and becomes the king of heaven again.<ref name = \"Mani\">{{cite book|author = Mani, Vettam|title = Puranic Encyclopaedia: A Comprehensive Dictionary With Special Reference to the Epic and Puranic Literature|publisher = Motilal Banarsidass|year = 1975|location = Delhi|isbn = 0-8426-0822-2|page = 859}}</ref><ref name = \"epic\"/>\n\n==Parentage and children==\nThe ''Taittiriya [[Aranyaka]]'' states Sarama is a ''vedi'' \u2013 a holy altar, daughter of [[Dyaus]] (\"Heaven\") and [[Prithvi]] (\"Earth\"), and the sister of Brihaspati and [[Rudra]].<ref>Singh pp. 156\u20137</ref>\n\nIn a late hymn in the tenth ''Mandala'' of the Rig Veda, two ''Sarameya'' (literally, \"sons of Sarama\"), Shyama and Sabala, are described without an explicit reference to Sarama as their mother.

They are guardians to the path of heaven, protecting man on their path.<ref name = \"Mani\"/><ref name = \"aurobindo\"/> A hymn in the ''Paraskara [[Kalpa_(Vedanga)#Grhya_Sutras|Grihya Sutra]]'' says that Shyama and Sabala are sons of Sarama, their father Sisara. In a spell called ''Ekagni-kanda'', intended to drive away the Dog-spirits (''sav-graha'') like Shyama, Sabala, Alaba, Rji etc. which cause cough in children, Sarama is mentioned as their mother. Sarama's spying on the cows is mentioned, with Indra giving her the right to pester children in return.<ref>Singh pp. 157\u20138</ref>\n \nOften described as the mother of all dogs, she is also sometimes regarded as the mother of all beasts of prey, including lions and tigers, as in ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.<ref name = \"monier\"/> She is also a daughter of [[Daksha]] in this Purana and not a dog.<ref>[http://vedabase.net/sb/6/6/24-26/ Bhaktivedanta VedaBase: \u015ar\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 6.6.24\u201326] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712011112/http://vedabase.net/sb/6/6/24-26/ |date=2010-07-12 }}</ref>\n\n==Epics==\n[[File:00005 Janamejaya and brothers.jpg|right|thumb|King Janamejaya's brothers beat up a dog \u2013 son of Sarama, who curses the king in return]]\nThe epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' does not mention Sarama herself. However, it does mention an incident in which [[Rama]] punishes a [[Brahmin]] for beating a Sarameya \u2013 descendant of Sarama \u2013 for no reason. The epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' has a similar story.<ref name = \"epic\">Singh pp. 187\u201392</ref> In the first book of the epic ''[[Adi Parva]]'', king [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]]'s brothers beat up a dog, who comes near Janamejaya's [[yajna]] site. The crying dog complains to its mother Sarama that it was beaten by Janamejaya's brothers for no reason. Sarama reaches Janamejaya's sacrifice site and curses him that since he has harmed her son without reason, unseen danger will befall him.

She may be a fair-footed goddess to whom the Panis are attracted and whom they ask to be their sister. It is only in later interpretations of the Vedic imagery that Sarama becomes a divine hound, who sniffs out the Panis and leads her master to them. According to Sri Aurobindo, the phrase in which Sarama demands food for her progeny is misinterpreted with equating Sarama's children to a dog-race born of Sarama. It is the reference to the Sarameya dogs \u2013 sons of Sarama \u2013 in a late hymn that cements the notion of Sarama being a dog.<ref name = \"aurobindo\"/><ref name = \"Wendy\"/><ref>Singh p. 143</ref>\n\nThe role of Sarama in the Rig Vedic legend leads Sri Aurobindo to say, \"Sarama is some power of Light and probably of Dawn\". She \"must be a forerunner of the dawn of Truth in the human mind\". Sarama is \"the traveller and the seeker who does not herself possess [the Truth] but rather finds what is lost\".<ref name = \"aurobindo\"/> Max M\u00fcller relates Sarama to the Ushas, the Dawn. The tale of kidnapping of the cows and their recovery, he explains, is the disappearance of the bright cows or rays of the Sun. Sarama, the Dawn, finds them and is followed by Indra, the god of light.<ref>M\u00fcller pp. 487\u2013491</ref> \n\nWhen explaining the two references in which Sarama follows the \"path of Truth\", Sayana calls Sarama the heavenly dog or Speech ([[V\u0101c]]) herself.<ref name = \"Singh\"/> The Vac-identity of Sarama is also emphasized in the ''Yajus-samhita''s and by Mahidhara, commentator of the ''Vajasaneyi Samhita''.<ref name = \"Singh158\"/> The ''Brhaddevata'', which speaks of Sarama's unfaithfulness, also mentions Sarama as one of the names of Vac in the middle sphere (world), where Vac is said to have three forms in three spheres.

The photo was taken on Tingh\u00fasv\u00f8llur in [[T\u00f3rshavn]].]]\n'''Sunleif Rasmussen''' (born March 19, 1961 in [[Sandur (Faroe Islands)|Sandur]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]) is the foremost [[Faroese people|Faroese]] composer of classical music.\n\n== Biography ==\nRasmussen studied in [[Norway]], then returned to [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in the Faroes as a music teacher and [[jazz]] pianist. From 1990 to 1995 he studied musical composition at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in [[Copenhagen]] under [[Ib N\u00f8rholm]] and electronic music under [[Ivar Frounberg]]. In 1992 he received grants from the Leonie Sonning Foundation and the Danish Composer's Society.\n\nHe also became familiar with [[spectral music]], which has its roots at the [[IRCAM]] in [[Paris]], and the work of composers such as [[Tristan Murail]]. Rasmussen has produced a number of works combining electronic and acoustic instruments, some produced in co-operation with DIEM (the Danish Institute for Electro-Acoustic Music).\n\nIn 1997, he was awarded a three-year grant from the Danish State Arts Foundation.\n\nIn 2002, he won the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] for his Symphony no. 1 - \"Oceanic Days\", which, in the NOMUS committee description: ''\"derives its inspiration from Faroese nature and from age-old [[Faroese ballads|Faroese hymns]], from which Rasmussen has created a work of comprehensive dimensions. It radiates a natural artistic integrity, combining tightness and structure with lyric feeling.\" ''\n\nIn 2004, he was visiting composer at the prestigious [[Korsholm]] Festival in [[Finland]], while in 2010, he received the [[Faroese Cultural Prize]] from the Faroese Department of Culture. In 2013, he participated in the residency and concert series [[Other Minds (organization)|Other Minds]] in San Francisco.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Photo of Sunleif Rasmussen at a pre-concert panel at the 2013 Other Minds festival in San Francisco, Mar 2013.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rasmussen speaking at a pre-concert panel discussion at Other Minds 18 in 2013]]\nRasmussen\u2019s music always has a natural complexity, combining his jazz background with a rich tradition of Faroese folk music and [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] and [[spectral music]].  He transforms folk music themes using spectral and [[serialism|serial]] techniques, using [[Interval (music)|intervals]] in the original melody to generate rhythmic segments and harmonic overtone spectra to determine the melodic and timbral material; the result is an abstraction from Faroese traditional music, even though none of the original melodies can be discerned in the finished composition. He also draws much inspiration from the Faroese author and artist [[William Heinesen]] (1900-1991), using both the text and the mood of Heinesen's poetry in his music.\n\nThe result is highly evocative, beautiful, and not difficult to listen to. The power and complexity of his music often reflects nature, shimmering with energy and movement.\n\n==Works==\nHis works include:\n\n'''Orchestral works''':\n* 1990: ''Grave - In memoriam [[Karsten Hoydal]]'' for String orchestra + percussion (11 or 22 strings: 3.3.2.2.1) (09'00)\n* 1995: ''Vox Humana, the song of the sea - for orchestra and tape'' for 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/harp/strings (22'00)\n* 1995-97: ''Symphony no. 1 - \"Oceanic Days\"'' for 4.4.4.4/4.4.4.1/4 percussion/2 synth/strings (min. 12.12.10.8.6) (40'00)\n* 2003: ''De gr\u00e6dendes nat'' for children's choir (including 3 soloists) + 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/2 percussion/harp/strings (15'00)\n* 2004: ''Movings and Melodies'' for 2.2.2.2/2.2.1.0/timpani/percussion/5.5.3.3.2 (17'00)\n* 2008: ''Prelude to an Orchestra'' for 3(piccolo).3(cor anglais).3.3(contrabassoon)/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/strings (30'00)\n* 2013: ''Veitsla'' for 2.2.2.2/4.3.3.1/timpani/3 percussion/strings (12'00)\n* 2015: ''Symphony no. 2 - \"The Earth Anew\"'' for soprano, baritone, choir, 3.3.2+bass clarinet, 2+contrabassoon/4331/timpani, 3 percussions/piano/strings (1 hour)\n\n'''Solo instrument and orchestra/ensemble'''\n* 1992-93: ''Landid'' for soprano solo + 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/harp/piano/strings (15'00)\n* 1996: ''Tilegnelse'' for mezzo-soprano solo + 1.0.1.1/0.1.0.0/2 percussion/harp/guitar/0.0.1.0.1 (10'00)\n* 2000: ''Rejsen'' for soprano, tenor, bass soli, mixed choir + 3.3.3.3/2.3.3.1/timpani/percussion/piano/strings (30'00)\n* 2001: ''Dem Licht entgegen'' for saxophone solo + 3.3.3.3/4.3.2.1/timp/2 percussion/piano/strings (18'30)\n* 2004: ''Songs of Seasons'' for violin solo + string orchestra (10.0.4.3.2) (22'00)\n* 2009: ''Territorial Songs'' for recorder solo + 3.2.2.2./2.2.2.0/2 percussion/harp/strings 23'00\n* 2014: ''Winter Echoes'' for recorder solo and 7 violins, 3 violas, 2 cellos and double bass (11'00)\n\n'''Large chamber ensemble'''\n* 1999: ''Trauer und Freude'' for 1.0.1.1/1.0.0.0/piano (+cemb)/guitar/1.1.1.1.0 (21'00)\n* 2000: ''Surrounded'' for 1.1.1.1/1.1.1.0/percussion/piano/1.1.1.1.1 (13'00)\n* 2009: ''Fanfare lontane'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, 2 trumpets and trombone (15'00)\n\n'''Chamber works'''\n* 1989: ''Fantasi yvir T\u00edvilsd\u00f8tur'' for clarinet and horn (04'00)\n* 1989-90: ''Strygekvartet nr. 1'' for string quartet (10'00)\n* 1990: ''Vetrarmyndir'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn and piano (09'00)\n* 1991: ''Tid, ild, bagl\u00e6ns (Time, fire, backwards)'' for twelve singers and tape (16'30)\n* 1995: ''Cantus Borealis'' for Wind Quintet (13'00)\n* 1995: ''Dancing Raindrops'' for clarinet, piano and violin (12'00)\n* 1998: ''Pictures from the sea\u2019s garden'' for saxophone and percussion (15'00)\n* 1999: ''Mozaik/Miniature'' for flute, clarinet, piano and violin (07'00)\n* 2000: ''Sunshine and Shadows'' for string quartet (13'00)\n* 2002: ''Nordisk Fanfare'' for 2 horns, 2 trumpets, trombone and tuba (04'00)\n* 2002: ''Engf\u00fchrung'' for chamber choir, piano and cello (20'00)\n* 2003: ''Four Gardens'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, piano, violin, viola and cello (15'00)\n* 2008: ''Partita'' for clarinet, piano, violin and cello (12'00)\n* 2010: ''Three Dances'' for 4 saxophones (10'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 1'' for flute and clarinet (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 2'' for 2 flutes (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 3'' for clarinet and horn (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 11'' for alto flute and bassoon (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Motion/Emotion'' for flute, clarinet, oboe, horn, and bassoon (15'00)\n* 2012: ''Flow'' for recorder, violin, viola and cello (20'00)\n* 2012: ''Krevgals go Aprah'' harp and percussion (14'00)\n* 2012: ''Andalag No. 4'' for 2 bassoons (4'00)\n* 2012: ''Andalag No. 5'' for alto flute, clarinet, bassoon and horn (8'00)\n* 2013: ''Andalag No. 7'' for piccolo, E-flat clarinet, horn and bassoon (8'00)\n* 2013: ''Autumn'' for guitar, piano, accordion, violin and double-bass (9'00)\n\n'''Solo instrument'''\n* 1992: ''Echoes of the Past'' for violin solo (12'00)\n* 1993: ''A light is lit'' for organ solo and tape (10'00)\n* 1993: ''Like the golden sun'' for piano solo and effect processor (12'00)\n* 1997: ''Chaindance with Shadows'' for amplified piano solo (12'00)\n* 2001: ''Le psaume sal\u00e9'' for saxophone solo + tape + live-electronics (10'00)\n* 2007: ''Suite''  for guitar solo and effect processor (15'00) \n* 2011: ''Vogelstimmung'' for solo recorder (17'00)\n\n'''Vocal works'''\n* 1982-89, revised 1992: ''5 f\u00e6r\u00f8ske korsange (5 Faroese choir songs)'' for chamber choir or large mixed choir (11'30)\n* 1983, revised 1993: ''V\u00e1r'' for Soprano, baritone soli + chamber choir, (SATB), fl, cl (09'20)\n* 1995: ''Psalmus 8'' for soloists, choir and organ (08'00)\n* 1996: ''Creatio caeli et terrae.

The photo was taken on Tingh\u00fasv\u00f8llur in [[T\u00f3rshavn]].]]\n'''Sunleif Rasmussen''' (born March 19, 1961 in [[Sandur (Faroe Islands)|Sandur]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]) is the foremost [[Faroese people|Faroese]] composer of classical music.\n\n== Biography ==\nRasmussen studied in [[Norway]], then returned to [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in the Faroes as a music teacher and [[jazz]] pianist. From 1990 to 1995 he studied musical composition at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in [[Copenhagen]] under [[Ib N\u00f8rholm]] and electronic music under [[Ivar Frounberg]]. In 1992 he received grants from the Leonnie Sonning Foundation and the Danish Composer's Society.\n\nHe also became familiar with [[spectral music]], which has its roots at the [[IRCAM]] in [[Paris]], and the work of composers such as [[Tristan Murail]]. Rasmussen has produced a number of works combining electronic and acoustic instruments, some produced in co-operation with DIEM (the Danish Institute for Electro-Acoustic Music).\n\nIn 1997, he was awarded a three-year grant from the Danish State Arts Foundation.\n\nIn 2002, he won the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] for his Symphony no. 1 - \"Oceanic Days\", which, in the NOMUS committee description: ''\"derives its inspiration from Faroese nature and from age-old [[Faroese ballads|Faroese hymns]], from which Rasmussen has created a work of comprehensive dimensions. It radiates a natural artistic integrity, combining tightness and structure with lyric feeling.\" ''\n\nIn 2004, he was visiting composer at the prestigious [[Korsholm]] Festival in [[Finland]], while in 2010, he received the [[Faroese Cultural Prize]] from the Faroese Department of Culture. In 2013, he participated in the residency and concert series [[Other Minds (organization)|Other Minds]] in San Francisco.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Photo of Sunleif Rasmussen at a pre-concert panel at the 2013 Other Minds festival in San Francisco, Mar 2013.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rasmussen speaking at a pre-concert panel discussion at Other Minds 18 in 2013]]\nRasmussen\u2019s music always has a natural complexity, combining his jazz background with a rich tradition of Faroese folk music and [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] and [[spectral music]].  He transforms folk music themes using spectral and [[serialism|serial]] techniques, using [[Interval (music)|intervals]] in the original melody to generate rhythmic segments and harmonic overtone spectra to determine the melodic and timbral material; the result is an abstraction from Faroese traditional music, even though none of the original melodies can be discerned in the finished composition. He also draws much inspiration from the Faroese author and artist [[William Heinesen]] (1900-1991), using both the text and the mood of Heinesen's poetry in his music.\n\nThe result is highly evocative, beautiful, and not difficult to listen to. The power and complexity of his music often reflects nature, shimmering with energy and movement.\n\n==Works==\nHis works include:\n\n'''Orchestral works''':\n* 1990: ''Grave - In memoriam [[Karsten Hoydal]]'' for String orchestra + percussion (11 or 22 strings: 3.3.2.2.1) (09'00)\n* 1995: ''Vox Humana, the song of the sea - for orchestra and tape'' for 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/harp/strings (22'00)\n* 1995-97: ''Symphony no. 1 - \"Oceanic Days\"'' for 4.4.4.4/4.4.4.1/4 percussion/2 synth/strings (min. 12.12.10.8.6) (40'00)\n* 2003: ''De gr\u00e6dendes nat'' for children's choir (including 3 soloists) + 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/2 percussion/harp/strings (15'00)\n* 2004: ''Movings and Melodies'' for 2.2.2.2/2.2.1.0/timpani/percussion/5.5.3.3.2 (17'00)\n* 2008: ''Prelude to an Orchestra'' for 3(piccolo).3(cor anglais).3.3(contrabassoon)/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/strings (30'00)\n* 2013: ''Veitsla'' for 2.2.2.2/4.3.3.1/timpani/3 percussion/strings (12'00)\n* 2015: ''Symphony no. 2 - \"The Earth Anew\"'' for soprano, baritone, choir, 3.3.2+bass clarinet, 2+contrabassoon/4331/timpani, 3 percussions/piano/strings (1 hour)\n\n'''Solo instrument and orchestra/ensemble'''\n* 1992-93: ''Landid'' for soprano solo + 3.3.3.3/4.3.3.1/timpani/2 percussion/harp/piano/strings (15'00)\n* 1996: ''Tilegnelse'' for mezzo-soprano solo + 1.0.1.1/0.1.0.0/2 percussion/harp/guitar/0.0.1.0.1 (10'00)\n* 2000: ''Rejsen'' for soprano, tenor, bass soli, mixed choir + 3.3.3.3/2.3.3.1/timpani/percussion/piano/strings (30'00)\n* 2001: ''Dem Licht entgegen'' for saxophone solo + 3.3.3.3/4.3.2.1/timp/2 percussion/piano/strings (18'30)\n* 2004: ''Songs of Seasons'' for violin solo + string orchestra (10.0.4.3.2) (22'00)\n* 2009: ''Territorial Songs'' for recorder solo + 3.2.2.2./2.2.2.0/2 percussion/harp/strings 23'00\n* 2014: ''Winter Echoes'' for recorder solo and 7 violins, 3 violas, 2 cellos and double bass (11'00)\n\n'''Large chamber ensemble'''\n* 1999: ''Trauer und Freude'' for 1.0.1.1/1.0.0.0/piano (+cemb)/guitar/1.1.1.1.0 (21'00)\n* 2000: ''Surrounded'' for 1.1.1.1/1.1.1.0/percussion/piano/1.1.1.1.1 (13'00)\n* 2009: ''Fanfare lontane'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, 2 trumpets and trombone (15'00)\n\n'''Chamber works'''\n* 1989: ''Fantasi yvir T\u00edvilsd\u00f8tur'' for clarinet and horn (04'00)\n* 1989-90: ''Strygekvartet nr. 1'' for string quartet (10'00)\n* 1990: ''Vetrarmyndir'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn and piano (09'00)\n* 1991: ''Tid, ild, bagl\u00e6ns (Time, fire, backwards)'' for twelve singers and tape (16'30)\n* 1995: ''Cantus Borealis'' for Wind Quintet (13'00)\n* 1995: ''Dancing Raindrops'' for clarinet, piano and violin (12'00)\n* 1998: ''Pictures from the sea\u2019s garden'' for saxophone and percussion (15'00)\n* 1999: ''Mozaik/Miniature'' for flute, clarinet, piano and violin (07'00)\n* 2000: ''Sunshine and Shadows'' for string quartet (13'00)\n* 2002: ''Nordisk Fanfare'' for 2 horns, 2 trumpets, trombone and tuba (04'00)\n* 2002: ''Engf\u00fchrung'' for chamber choir, piano and cello (20'00)\n* 2003: ''Four Gardens'' for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, piano, violin, viola and cello (15'00)\n* 2008: ''Partita'' for clarinet, piano, violin and cello (12'00)\n* 2010: ''Three Dances'' for 4 saxophones (10'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 1'' for flute and clarinet (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 2'' for 2 flutes (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 3'' for clarinet and horn (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Andalag No. 11'' for alto flute and bassoon (4'00)\n* 2011: ''Motion/Emotion'' for flute, clarinet, oboe, horn, and bassoon (15'00)\n* 2012: ''Flow'' for recorder, violin, viola and cello (20'00)\n* 2012: ''Krevgals go Aprah'' harp and percussion (14'00)\n* 2012: ''Andalag No. 4'' for 2 bassoons (4'00)\n* 2012: ''Andalag No. 5'' for alto flute, clarinet, bassoon and horn (8'00)\n* 2013: ''Andalag No. 7'' for piccolo, E-flat clarinet, horn and bassoon (8'00)\n* 2013: ''Autumn'' for guitar, piano, accordion, violin and double-bass (9'00)\n\n'''Solo instrument'''\n* 1992: ''Echoes of the Past'' for violin solo (12'00)\n* 1993: ''A light is lit'' for organ solo and tape (10'00)\n* 1993: ''Like the golden sun'' for piano solo and effect processor (12'00)\n* 1997: ''Chaindance with Shadows'' for amplified piano solo (12'00)\n* 2001: ''Le psaume sal\u00e9'' for saxophone solo + tape + live-electronics (10'00)\n* 2007: ''Suite''  for guitar solo and effect processor (15'00) \n* 2011: ''Vogelstimmung'' for solo recorder (17'00)\n\n'''Vocal works'''\n* 1982-89, revised 1992: ''5 f\u00e6r\u00f8ske korsange (5 Faroese choir songs)'' for chamber choir or large mixed choir (11'30)\n* 1983, revised 1993: ''V\u00e1r'' for Soprano, baritone soli + chamber choir, (SATB), fl, cl (09'20)\n* 1995: ''Psalmus 8'' for soloists, choir and organ (08'00)\n* 1996: ''Creatio caeli et terrae.

Deer [[hunting]] has been a popular activity since at least the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{anchor|doe}}\n[[File:Chital (8458215435).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chital]] deer in [[Nagarhole National Park|Nagarahole]], India]]\n\nDeer live in a variety of [[biome]]s, ranging from [[tundra]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]. While often associated with forests, many deer are [[ecotone]] species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the [[understory]] and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\n\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the [[Barbary stag]], a subspecies of [[red deer]] that is confined to the [[Atlas Mountains]] in the northwest of the continent, an additonal extinct species of giant deer ''[[Megaceroides|Megaceroides algericus]]'' was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. [[Fallow deer]] have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of [[brocket deer]] and [[pud\u00fa]]s of Central and South America, and [[muntjac]]s of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the [[Indian muntjac]]. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the [[Reindeer|caribou]] that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and [[moose]] that inhabit [[taiga]] and adjacent areas. Huemul deer ([[taruca]] and [[South Andean deer|Chilean huemul]]) of South America's [[Andes]] fill the ecological niches of the [[ibex]] and [[wild goat]], with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the [[Canadian Rocky Mountains|Canadian Rocky Mountain]] and [[Columbia Mountains|Columbia Mountain]] regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species ([[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], caribou, [[elk]], and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], [[Yoho National Park]], and [[Kootenay National Park]] on the British Columbia side, and [[Banff National Park]], [[Jasper National Park]], and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and [[alpine tundra]] areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent [[Great Plains]] grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, [[American bison]], and [[pronghorn]] antelope.\n\n[[File:Reindeer-on-the-rocks.jpg|thumb|[[Reindeer]] herds, standing on snow to avoid flies]]\n\nThe [[Eurasia]]n Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. However, many national parks and protected reserves in Europe do have populations of red deer, [[roe deer]], and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and Northwestern [[Iran]]. \"European\" fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day [[Turkey]].\n\nPresent-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct [[tarpan]] (forest horse), extinct [[aurochs]] (forest ox), and the endangered [[wisent]] (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the [[Scottish Highlands]], the Austrian [[Alps]], the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including [[Do\u00f1ana National Park]] in Spain, the [[Veluwe]] in the Netherlands, the [[Ardennes]] in Belgium, and [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park]] of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, [[Eurasian lynx]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[brown bear]]s.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find [[Siberian roe deer]], [[sika deer]], elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.\n\nDeer such as the sika deer, [[Thorold's deer]], [[Central Asian red deer]], and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by [[Han Chinese]], [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tungusic peoples]], [[Mongolia]]ns, and [[Koreans]]. Like the [[Sami people]] of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to [[chital]], [[hog deer]], [[barasingha]], Indian [[Sambar deer|sambar]], and [[Indian muntjac]]. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which [[Kanha National Park]], [[Dudhwa National Park]], and [[Chitwan National Park]] are most famous. Sri Lanka's [[Wilpattu National Park]] and [[Yala National Park]] have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.\n\nThe Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct [[Schomburgk's deer]], [[Eld's deer]], Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as [[Khao Yai National Park|Khao Yai]]. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other [[herbivory|herbivores]], such as [[Asian elephant]]s, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as [[nilgai]], [[four-horned antelope]], [[blackbuck]], and [[Chinkara|Indian gazelle]] in India), and wild oxen (such as [[wild Asian water buffalo]], [[gaur]], [[banteng]], and [[kouprey]]). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.\n\nAustralia has six [[introduced species]] of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from [[acclimatisation society]] releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, [[Javan rusa|rusa]], and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in [[deer farm]]s by the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.<ref name=\"DeerInNewZealand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/mammals-introduced/page-10|title=Deer|website=Te Ara: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|editor-first=A.

The deer require a large amount of minerals such as [[calcium]] and phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet. There are, however, some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity, such as depredating the nests of [[Northern bobwhite]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis-Felege | first1 = S.

A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until December. Some species mate until early March. The [[gestation period]] is anywhere up to ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter. In the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so [[predator]]s will not find it. Its mother leaves often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/mammals/deer.htm Deer \u2013 info and games] Sheppard Software.</ref> The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother. The fawn and its mother stay together for about one year. A male usually leaves and never sees his mother again, but females sometimes come back with their own fawns and form small herds.\n\n===Disease===\nIn some areas of the UK, deer (especially [[fallow deer]] due to their [[gregarious behaviour]]), have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of [[bovine tuberculosis]],<ref name=\"Delahay et al., 2007\">{{cite journal|last1=Delahay |first1=R.

Studies in the late 20th century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family. This as well as previous studies support [[monophyly]] in Cervinae, while Capreolinae appears [[paraphyletic]]. The 2006 study identified two lineages in Cervinae, Cervini (comprising the genera ''[[Axis (genus)|Axis]]'', ''[[Cervus]]'', ''[[Dama (deer)|Dama]]'' and ''[[Rucervus]]'') and Muntiacini (''[[Muntiacus]]'' and ''[[Elaphodus]]''). Capreolinae featured three lineages, Alceini (''[[Alces]]'' species), Capreolini (''[[Capreolus]]'' and the subfamily Hydropotinae) and Rangiferini (''[[Blastocerus]]'', ''[[Hippocamelus]]'', ''[[Mazama (genus)|Mazama]]'', ''[[Odocoileus]]'', ''[[Pudu (genus)|Pudu]]'' and ''[[Reindeer|Rangifer]]'' species).

The name was popularised in the 18th century by [[James Macpherson]], creator of 'Ossianic poetry'.\n\n===In literature===\nDeer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of writing. Stags were used as symbols in the latter Sumerian writings. For instance, the boat of Sumerian god Enki is named the ''Stag of Azbu''. There are several mentions of the animal in the [[Rigveda]] as well as the [[Bible]]. In the Indian epic [[Ramayana]], [[Sita]] is lured by a golden deer which [[Rama]] tries to catch. In the absence of both Rama and [[Lakshman]], [[Ravana]] kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical [[Aesop's fables]], such as \"The Stag at the Pool\", \"The One-Eyed Doe\" and \"The Stag and a Lion\", personify deer to give moral lessons. For instance, \"The Sick Stag\" gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than good.<ref name=guide/> The [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola [from the Spanish 'pascua', Easter] dancer (also known as a deer dancer).

In [[C. S.

In the British armory, the term \"stag\" is typically used to refer to antlered male red deer, while \"buck\" indicates an antlered male fallow deer. Stags and bucks appear in a number of [[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]], referred to as \"lodged\" when the deer is lying down, \"trippant\" when it has one leg raised, \"courant\" when it is running, \"springing\" when in the act of leaping, \"statant\" when it is standing with all hooves on the ground and looking ahead, and \"at gaze\" when otherwise statant but looking at the viewer. Stags' heads are also frequently used; these are typically portrayed without an attached neck and as facing the viewer, in which case they are termed \"caboshed\".<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C.

For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507&nbsp;million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan.<ref name=\"O'Brien et al., 2011\"/>\n\nDeer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that provides the hunter's family with high quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that license sales generate approximately $700&nbsp;million annually. This revenue generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are purchased. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that big game hunting for deer and elk generates approximately $11.8&nbsp;billion annually in hunting-related travel, equipment and related expenditures.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/pubs/nat_survey2006_final.pdf |title=U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. 2006 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation |date= |accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''deer'' was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. [[Old English]] ''d\u0113or'' and [[Middle English]] ''der''  meant a wild animal of any kind. <!--In Shakespeare's time, \"small deer\" meant any type of petty game, not worth pursuing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Small+deer |title=Small deer |accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> in contrast to ''[[cattle]]'', which then meant any sort of domestic livestock that could be removed from the land, related to personal-property ownership, as with modern ''[[chattel]]'' (property) and [[financial capital| financial ''capital'']]. Wild animals in a forest were considered part of [[real estate]], and sold with the land.--> Cognates of Old English ''d\u0113or'' in other dead [[Germanic languages]] have the general sense of ''animal'', such as [[Old High German]] ''tior'', [[Old Norse]] ''djur'' or ''d\u0233r'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''dius'', [[Old Saxon]] ''dier'', and [[Old Frisian]] ''diar''.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325232020/http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archivedate=25 March 2004 |chapter=deer|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2000}}</ref> This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500.

The two main groups of deer are the [[Cervinae]], including the [[muntjac]], the [[elk]] (wapiti), the [[fallow deer]], and the [[chital]]; and the [[Capreolinae]], including the [[reindeer]] (caribou), the [[roe deer]], and the [[moose]]. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the Chinese [[water deer]], grow and shed new [[antler]]s each year. In this they differ from permanently [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]ed [[antelope]], which are part of a different family ([[Bovidae]]) within the same order of [[even-toed ungulates]] (Artiodactyla).\n\nThe [[musk deer]] ([[Moschidae]]) of Asia and [[chevrotain]]s ([[Chevrotain|Tragulidae]]) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families within the ruminant clade ([[Ruminantia]]). They are no more closely related to deer than are other even-toed ungulates.\n\nDeer appear in art from [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s onwards, and they have [[deer in mythology|played a role in mythology]], religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in [[heraldry]]. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as [[venison]], their skins as soft, strong [[buckskin (leather)|buckskin]], and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer [[hunting]] has been a popular activity since at least the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{anchor|doe}}\n[[File:Chital (8458215435).jpg|thumb|left|[[Chital]] deer in [[Nagarhole National Park|Nagarahole]], India]]\n\nDeer live in a variety of [[biome]]s, ranging from [[tundra]] to the [[tropical rainforest]]. While often associated with forests, many deer are [[ecotone]] species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the [[understory]] and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However, adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.\n\nDeer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the [[Barbary stag]], a subspecies of [[red deer]] that is confined to the [[Atlas Mountains]] in the northwest of the continent, an additonal extinct species of giant deer ''[[Megaceroides|Megaceroides algericus]]'' was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. [[Fallow deer]] have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of [[brocket deer]] and [[pud\u00fa]]s of Central and South America, and [[muntjac]]s of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the [[Indian muntjac]]. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized, and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and \"wet\" savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the [[Reindeer|caribou]] that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and [[moose]] that inhabit [[taiga]] and adjacent areas. Huemul deer ([[taruca]] and [[South Andean deer|Chilean huemul]]) of South America's [[Andes]] fill the ecological niches of the [[ibex]] and [[wild goat]], with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the [[Canadian Rocky Mountains|Canadian Rocky Mountain]] and [[Columbia Mountains|Columbia Mountain]] regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species ([[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], caribou, [[elk]], and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]], [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], [[Yoho National Park]], and [[Kootenay National Park]] on the British Columbia side, and [[Banff National Park]], [[Jasper National Park]], and [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)]] on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and [[alpine tundra]] areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent [[Great Plains]] grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, [[American bison]], and [[pronghorn]] antelope.\n\n[[File:Reindeer-on-the-rocks.jpg|thumb|[[Reindeer]] herds, standing on snow to avoid flies]]\n\nThe [[Eurasia]]n Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. However, many national parks and protected reserves in Europe do have populations of red deer, [[roe deer]], and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and Northwestern [[Iran]]. \"European\" fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day [[Turkey]].\n\nPresent-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct [[tarpan]] (forest horse), extinct [[aurochs]] (forest ox), and the endangered [[wisent]] (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the [[Scottish Highlands]], the Austrian [[Alps]], the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including [[Do\u00f1ana National Park]] in Spain, the [[Veluwe]] in the Netherlands, the [[Ardennes]] in Belgium, and [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|Bia\u0142owie\u017ca National Park]] of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, [[Eurasian lynx]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[brown bear]]s.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find [[Siberian roe deer]], [[sika deer]], elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.\n\nDeer such as the sika deer, [[Thorold's deer]], [[Central Asian red deer]], and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by [[Han Chinese]], [[Turkic peoples]], [[Tungusic peoples]], [[Mongolia]]ns, and [[Koreans]]. Like the [[Sami people]] of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.\n\nThe highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to [[chital]], [[hog deer]], [[barasingha]], Indian [[Sambar deer|sambar]], and [[Indian muntjac]]. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which [[Kanha National Park]], [[Dudhwa National Park]], and [[Chitwan National Park]] are most famous. Sri Lanka's [[Wilpattu National Park]] and [[Yala National Park]] have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.\n\nThe Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct [[Schomburgk's deer]], [[Eld's deer]], Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as [[Khao Yai National Park|Khao Yai]]. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other [[herbivory|herbivores]], such as [[Asian elephant]]s, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as [[nilgai]], [[four-horned antelope]], [[blackbuck]], and [[Chinkara|Indian gazelle]] in India), and wild oxen (such as [[wild Asian water buffalo]], [[gaur]], [[banteng]], and [[kouprey]]). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.\n\nAustralia has six [[introduced species]] of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from [[acclimatisation society]] releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, [[Javan rusa|rusa]], and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in [[deer farm]]s by the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.<ref name=\"DeerInNewZealand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/mammals-introduced/page-10|title=Deer|website=Te Ara: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand|year=1966|editor-first=A.

The deer require a large amount of minerals such as [[calcium]] and phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet.

A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until December. Some species mate until early March. The [[gestation period]] is anywhere up to ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter. In the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so [[predator]]s will not find it. Its mother leaves often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot.<ref name=\"Ref_a\">[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/mammals/deer.htm Deer \u2013 info and games] Sheppard Software.</ref> The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother.

In the absence of both Rama and [[Lakshman]], [[Ravana]] kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical [[Aesop's fables]], such as \"The Stag at the Pool\", \"The One-Eyed Doe\" and \"The Stag and a Lion\", personify deer to give moral lessons.

Lewis]]'s 1950 fantasy novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' the adult Pevensies, now kings and queens of [[Narnia]], chase the White Stag on a hunt, as the Stag is said to grant its captor a wish. The hunt is key in returning the Pevensies to their home in England. In the 1979 book ''[[The Animals of Farthing Wood (book)|The Animals of Farthing Wood]]'', The Great White Stag is the leader of all the animals.\n\n===Heraldry===\n[[File:Blason Raon aux bois.svg|thumb|upright|Arms of [[Raon-aux-Bois]], France]]\n\nDeer of various types appear frequently in European [[heraldry]]. In the British armory, the term \"stag\" is typically used to refer to antlered male red deer, while \"buck\" indicates an antlered male fallow deer. Stags and bucks appear in a number of [[Attitude (heraldry)|attitudes]], referred to as \"lodged\" when the deer is lying down, \"trippant\" when it has one leg raised, \"courant\" when it is running, \"springing\" when in the act of leaping, \"statant\" when it is standing with all hooves on the ground and looking ahead, and \"at gaze\" when otherwise statant but looking at the viewer. Stags' heads are also frequently used; these are typically portrayed without an attached neck and as facing the viewer, in which case they are termed \"caboshed\".<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Arthur Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, 208-210, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft.</ref>\n\nExamples of deer in [[coats of arms]] can be found in the arms of [[Hertfordshire]], England, and its county town of [[Hertford]]; both are examples of [[canting arms]]. A deer appears on the arms of the [[Israel Postal Company|Israeli Postal Authority]]. Coats of arms featuring deer include those of [[Dotternhausen]], [[Thierachern]], [[Friolzheim]], [[Bauen]], [[Albstadt]], and [[Dassel]] in Germany; of the [[Earls Bathurst]] in England; of [[Balakhna]], Russia; of [[\u00c5land]], Finland; of [[Gjemnes]], [[Hitra]], [[Hjartdal]], [[Rendalen]] and [[Voss]] in Norway; of [[Jelenia G\u00f3ra]], Poland; of [[Ume\u00e5]], Sweden; of [[Queensland]], Australia; of [[Cervera]], Catalonia; of [[Northern Ireland]]; and of [[Chile]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOther types of deer used in heraldry include the hind, portrayed much like the stag or buck but without antlers, as well as the reindeer and winged stags. Winged stags are used as [[supporter]]s in the arms of the [[de Carteret family]]. The sea-stag, possessing the antlers, head, forelegs and upper body of a stag and the tail of a [[mermaid]], is often found in German heraldry.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n===Economic significance===\n\nDeer have long had economic significance to humans. Deer meat, known as [[venison]], is highly nutritious.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Kralj |first1=Richard Andrew |url=https://extension.psu.edu/venison-is-it-for-you|title=Venison, Is It For You?|website=Penn State Extension|date=September 2014|language=en|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blythman |first1=Joanna |last2=Sykes |first2=Rosie |title=Why venison is good for you {{!}} Joanna Blythman and Rosie Sykes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/28/venison-deer-meat-health-heart-benefits |work=The Guardian |date=September 2013 |access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref> Due to the inherently wild nature and diet of deer, venison is most often obtained through deer hunting.  In the United States, it is produced in small amounts compared to beef but still represents a significant trade. By 2012, some 25,000 tons of red deer were raised on farms in North America. The major deer-producing countries are New Zealand, the market leader, with Ireland, Great Britain and Germany. The trade earns over $100&nbsp;million annually for these countries.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burden |first1=Dan |url=http://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/livestock/deer-venison-ranching-profile/ |publisher=Agricultural Marketing Resource Center |title=Deer Venison Ranching Profile |accessdate=11 April 2016 |date=June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe skins make a peculiarly strong, soft leather, known as [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]]. There is nothing special about skins with the fur on since the hair is brittle and soon falls off. The hoofs and horns are used for ornamental purposes, especially the antlers of the [[roe deer]], which are utilized for making umbrella handles, and for similar purposes; elk horn is often employed in making knife handles. In China, a medicine is made from stag horn, and the antlers of certain species are eaten when \"in the velvet\".<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Deer}}</ref> Among the [[Inuit]], the traditional ''[[ulu]]'' women's knife was made with an antler, horn, or ivory handle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inuit Bering Sea Eskimo Walrus Ivory and Iron Semi-Lunar Knife 'Ulu' (1800 to 1900 Inuit)|url=http://www.finch-and-co.co.uk/antiquities/d/inuit-bering-sea-eskimo-walrus-ivory-and-iron-semi-lunar-knife-ulu/51906|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mavrogheni trasura cerbi.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas Mavrogenes]], [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] of [[Wallachia]], riding through [[Bucharest]] in a stag\u2212drawn carriage.

In the U.S., about 1.5&nbsp;million deer-vehicle collisions occur each year, according to the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Those accidents cause about 150 human deaths and $1.1&nbsp;billion in property damage annually.<ref name=\"Ref_c\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/11/14/deer_crash/index.html |date=14 November 2006 |title=Worst states for auto-deer crashes |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=5 April 2009}}</ref> In Scotland, several roads including the [[A82 road|A82]], the [[A87 road|A87]] and the [[A835 road|A835]] have had significant enough problems with ''deer vehicle collisions'' (DVCs) that sets of vehicle activated automatic warning signs have been installed along these roads.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.snh.gov.uk/docs/C301114.pdf|title=North West Area: Vehicle Activated Deer Warning Signs|publisher=[[Transport Scotland]]|id=07/NW/0805/046|date=April 2010|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn some areas of the UK, deer (especially [[fallow deer]] due to their [[gregarious behaviour]]), have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of [[bovine tuberculosis]],<ref name=\"Delahay et al., 2007\"/><ref name=\"Ward et al., 2009\"/> a disease which in the UK in 2005 cost \u00a390&nbsp;million in attempts to eradicate.<ref name=\"The Vet Record, 2008\"/> In New Zealand, deer are thought to be important as vectors picking up ''M. bovis'' in areas where brushtail possums ''[[Trichosurus vulpecula]]'' are infected, and transferring it to previously uninfected possums when their carcasses are scavenged elsewhere.<ref name=\"Delehay et al, 2002\"/> The white-tailed deer ''[[Odocoileus virginianus]]'' has been confirmed as the sole maintenance host in the Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the US nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters killed approximately 489,922 white-tailed deer to procure venison, control the deer population, and minimize the spread of disease. These hunters purchased more than 1.5&nbsp;million deer harvest tags. The economic value of [[deer hunting]] to Michigan's economy is substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507&nbsp;million hunting white-tailed deer in Michigan.<ref name=\"O'Brien et al., 2011\"/>\n\nDeer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that provides the hunter's family with high quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that license sales generate approximately $700&nbsp;million annually. This revenue generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are purchased. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that big game hunting for deer and elk generates approximately $11.8&nbsp;billion annually in hunting-related travel, equipment and related expenditures.<ref name=\"Ref_d\">{{cite web|url=http://library.fws.gov/pubs/nat_survey2006_final.pdf |title=U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. 2006 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation |date= |accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''deer'' was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. [[Old English]] ''d\u0113or'' and [[Middle English]] ''der''  meant a wild animal of any kind. <!--In Shakespeare's time, \"small deer\" meant any type of petty game, not worth pursuing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Small+deer |title=Small deer |accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> in contrast to ''[[cattle]]'', which then meant any sort of domestic livestock that could be removed from the land, related to personal-property ownership, as with modern ''[[chattel]]'' (property) and [[financial capital| financial ''capital'']]. Wild animals in a forest were considered part of [[real estate]], and sold with the land.--> Cognates of Old English ''d\u0113or'' in other dead [[Germanic languages]] have the general sense of ''animal'', such as [[Old High German]] ''tior'', [[Old Norse]] ''djur'' or ''d\u0233r'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''dius'', [[Old Saxon]] ''dier'', and [[Old Frisian]] ''diar''.<ref name=\"Ref_\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040325232020/http://www.bartleby.com/61/75/D0087500.html |archivedate=25 March 2004 |chapter=deer|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |year=2000}}</ref> This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. However, all modern Germanic languages save English and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, German ''Tier'' and Norwegian ''dyr'' mean ''animal''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=Deer |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=deer |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Hirschjagd des Kurf\u00fcrsten Friedrich des Weisen (Kunsthistorisches Museum).jpg|thumb|\"The Stag Hunt of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]]\" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1529]]\n\nFor many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a ''buck'' and the female a ''doe'', but the terms vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male [[red deer]] is a ''stag'', while for other large species the male is a ''bull'', the female a ''cow'', as in cattle. In older usage, the male of any species is a ''[[Hart (deer)|hart]]'', especially if over five years old, and the female is a ''hind'', especially if three or more years old.<ref>[[OED]], s.v. ''hart'' and ''hind''</ref> The young of small species is a ''fawn'' and of large species a ''[[calf (animal)|calf]]''; a very small young may be a ''kid''. A castrated male is a ''havier''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/havier?s=t |title=Havier|dictionary=Dictionary.com |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref> A group of any species is a ''herd''.

His most notable films include the \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy\u2014''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), and ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981)\u2014as well as ''[[Massacre Time]]'' (1966), ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), ''[[White Fang (1973 film)|White Fang]]'' (1973), ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975), ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (1977), ''[[Zombi 2]]'' (1979), ''[[The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]''(1982), and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' (1990). Although a number of films over the years were said to have been \"co-produced\" by Fulci, in most cases he was just allowing them to use his name to promote the films (with the exception of ''City of the Living Dead'', which he did actively attempt to obtain funding for)<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 202.</ref>.\n\nBecause of the high level of visceral [[Splatter film|graphic violence]] present in many of his films, especially ''Zombi 2'', ''The Beyond'', ''Contraband'' and ''The New York Ripper'', Fulci is frequently referred to as \"The Godfather of Gore\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/fulci.htm|title=Lucio Fulci: Godfather of Gore|work=houseofhorrors.com|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> a title also given to [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].\n\n==Life and career==\nLucio Fulci was born in Trastavere, [[Rome]] on 17 June 1927. His mother Lucia was from a very poor but reputable [[Sicilians|Sicilian]], politically anti-fascist family, from [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. She had earlier eloped to Rome with a lover who later left her to raise their child (Lucio) alone. Lucio was raised by his mother and a female housekeeper. He attended the Naval College in Venice, and near the end of WW2, completed his studies back in Rome at the [[Giulio Cesare State Classical School]]. He was interested in art, music, film, soccer and always had a love for sailing.  <ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films.

He was in his young adult years a politically active radical for the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Fulci was even arrested by the police for demonstrating with the Communist Party. An assassination attempt on party leader Palmiro Togliatti caused a political crisis in Italy and calls for a general strike. After this incident, his relationship with his family became tense and chaotic and he lived an impoverished life for a time. \n\nHis mother encouraged him to be a lawyer, but he wound up going to medical school instead.<ref>Paolo Albiero & Giacomo Cacciatore: \"Dalla sinistra di via Veneto alla destra di Steno\" (1927-1958)</ref> <ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> After studying medicine for a time, he dropped out before completing his training, deciding that his true interests lay in cinema. He worked initially as an art critic, writing for Gazzetta delle Arti and Il Messaggero, and also joined the critical art group il Gruppo Arte Sociale.<ref name=FC1 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/fulci|title=Lucio Fulci|last=MacCormack|first=Patricia|date=22 April 2004|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nHis interest in the arts led him to apply to the Centro Sperimentale (Rome's film school) where he apprenticed, after which he worked first as a director of documentaries, then an assistant director of motion pictures, then a screenwriter working mainly in the Italian [[comedy film|comedy]] field In the early 1950s. The famed Italian director [[Steno]] took Fulci under his wing and allowed him to assist in the making of a number of comedies starring [[Tot\u00f2]]<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press.</ref>. Fulci finally became a full-fledged movie director beginning with ''I Ladri'' in 1959. \n\nIn the 1960s, Fulci wrote or directed more than 30 Italian comedies<ref>Filmography section</ref>, eleven of them starring the famous Italian comedian team of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. Most of these early comedies did not enjoy distribution in English-speaking markets, and are thus generally unavailable today in English. Fulci's first film to be distributed theatrically in the USA was ''Oh! Those Most Secret Agents!'' in 1965. Only three of his other 1960s films were ever released in the U.S.: ''Massacre Time'' (released as ''[[The Brute and the Beast]]'' in 1968), ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (as ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' in 1973) and ''Beatrice Cenci'' (as ''[[Conspiracy of Torture]]'', in 1976).\n\nFulci moved into directing [[giallo]] thrillers with ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971) and ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (''The Psychic'', 1977), as well as Spaghetti Westerns such as ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975) and ''[[Silver Saddle]]'' (1978), all of which were commercially successful and controversial in their depictions of graphic violence.  Some of the [[special effects]] in ''A Lizard in a Woman's Skin'' involving mutilated dogs in a vivisection room were so realistic that Fulci was dragged into court and charged with animal cruelty until he produced the artificial canine puppets that were utilised in the film (created by special effects maestro [[Carlo Rambaldi]]).<ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 />\n\nHis first film to gain significant notoriety in his native country, ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), combined scathing social commentary with the director's trademark graphic violence. Fulci had a [[Catholic]] upbringing and always referred to himself as a Catholic.<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 1982 |title=<nowiki>[Lucio Fulci interview]</nowiki> |magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]] |issue=48 |url=http://www.shockingimages.com/fulci/interview2.html |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> Despite this, some of his movies (''Beatrice Cenci'', ''Don't Torture a Duckling'', ''City of the Living Dead'', etc.) have been viewed as having very anti-Catholic sentiment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://landmarkafterdark.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=252&Itemid=211 |title=Atmosfear \u2013 20 Must-see Italian Horror films (1957-1987) PART III |work=landmarkafterdark.com |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> In one of his films, a priest is depicted as a serial child killer, while in another film, a priest commits suicide by hanging himself in a cemetery and is later reincarnated as a demon.\n\nIn 1979, he achieved his international breakthrough with ''[[Zombi 2]]'', a violent [[zombie]] film that was marketed in European territories as a sequel to [[George A. Romero|George Romero]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''/ ''Zombi'' (1978).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/ |title=The Zombification Family Tree: Legacy of the Living Dead |last=Ma\u00e7ek III |first=J. C. |date=15 June 2012 |work=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> He followed it up with several other horror films, also featuring zombies, which were popular horror film trope of the time. His features released from 1979 through 1982 (most of them scripted by famed Italian screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]]) were described by some critics as being among the most violent and gory films ever made. ''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981), ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]'' (1982) and ''[[Manhattan Baby]]'' (1982) were among his biggest hits, all of which were noted for their extreme content and significant amount of gore. Fulci also enjoyed acting, and indulged himself by giving himself cameo appearances in sixteen of the films he directed between 1967 and 1991.(See Filmography below). He also appeared in a cameo in a 1961 rock and roll film ''Sanremo - la Grande Sfida'' which he did not direct, and was featured on the film's one-sheet poster as well.<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. Filmography section</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies released in America were edited by the [[film distributor]] to ensure an [[MPAA film rating system|R rating]], such as ''The Beyond'', which was originally released on video in severely edited form as ''Seven Doors of Death''. Others were released Unrated in order to avoid an [[X-rating]] (as with ''Zombi 2'' and ''House by the Cemetery'') which would have restricted the films' target audiences to adults. The unrated films often played worldwide in [[drive-in theater|drive-ins]] and [[grindhouse]]s where they developed a cult following. Many of Fulci's horror films tend to contain \"injury to the eye\" sequences, in which a character's eyeball is either pierced or pulled out of its socket, usually in lingering, close-up detail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3261090|title=No Eyes are Safe: Lucio Fulci|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies were prohibited in Europe or were released in heavily cut versions. Of the original 72 films on the infamous [[video nasty]] list in the United Kingdom, three belonged to Fulci: ''Zombi 2'' (1979), ''The Beyond'' (1981), and ''House by the Cemetery'' (1981). After viewing Fulci's ''The New York Ripper'', not only did the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refuse the film a certificate, but every single print in the country was taken to an airport and returned to Italy by order of [[James Ferman]]; it was not until later that [[VIPCO]] allowed the release of the film, initially outsourcing production to a foreign source under police supervision before releasing a [[VHS]] in 2002 and a [[DVD]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084719/trivia |title=The New York Ripper (1982) - Trivia |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter collaborating with screenwriter Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct the movie ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]''  (a Conan-like barbarian fantasy) in [[Mexico]], failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film did poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by that time had gone his own way.\n\nFulci became ill from hepatitis in 1984, right after he finished directing ''[[Murder Rock]]'' in New York City, and had to be hospitalized in Italy for many months. Fulci spent most of 1984 hospitalized with [[cirrhosis]], and much of 1985 recuperating at home. After 1986, with diabetes plaguing him and the departure of screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti from his circle of friends, Fulci's endeavors as a director suffered. \n\nIn 1988, he had directed about two-thirds of ''[[Zombi 3]]'' in the [[Philippines]] before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an uncredited [[Bruno Mattei]]. Fulci later said that he hated the finished film and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits. Mattei has said in interviews that the film was Fulci's, and that he (Mattei) just added a few extra scenes to pad out the running time.{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}\n\nIn 1989, Fulci was hired to direct a pair of made-for-TV horror movies for the Italian market, neither of which aired in Italy due to the high amount of gore and violence. They were released later on DVD, however, outside of Italy. Fulci's intended comeback films ''[[Demonia (film)|Demonia]]'' and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' were produced in 1990. Both films struggled to get released and were considered critical disappointments. His final project, the 1991 psychological thriller ''[[The Door to Silence]]'', based on one of his own short stories, also received poor reviews. The release of this film is seen by some as the critical lowest point of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esplatter.com/reviews.php?id=22 |title=Horror Movie Review of Zombi 3 (Lucio Fulci) |last=Gore |first=Lucius |work=ESplatter |access-date=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Fulci suffered from emotional and physical health problems, reflected by a marked decline in the quality of his work. Fulci also continued to suffer during the late 1980s from reccurring problems with diabetes and his liver. He hid the severity of his illness from his friends and associates, so that he would not be deemed unemployable{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}. His wife's suicide in 1969 had always weighed heavily on him (his wife Marina had killed herself with a gas oven after learning she had inoperable cancer).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} People who knew Fulci well spoke of a third daughter he once had who he said was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, but this story was never confirmed, and the daughter's name (if in fact she existed) was never revealed by any of his biographers.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} Fulci biographer Stephen Thrower wrote \"....the suicide of his wife in 1969 was followed not long after by the death of a daughter in a road accident.\" {{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=267}} Dario Argento is quoted in one book as saying of Fulci \"His life was terrible. His wife committed suicide, and his daughter was paralyzed because of an accident.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=268}}\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, Fulci made a deal with producers Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some of their low-budget horror films that he had not even worked on, simply to make the films more marketable to foreign distributors.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} Although he did supervise the special gore effects in ''The Murder Secret'', and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of ''Hansel and Gretel'', he was hardly at all involved with some of the other projects which nonetheless bore the \"Lucio Fulci Presents\" label on their video display boxes.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]''. Fulci tried unsuccessfully however to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's ''[[The Red Monks]]'', since he said he had had no involvement whatsoever with the project (the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them put his name in the credits).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=344}}\n\nIt could be argued that at his peak, Fulci's fame and popularity were on a par with that of [[Dario Argento]], another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci's publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded in his home country as something of a horror film \"hack\".{{sfn|Thrower|1999}} Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.\n\nFulci and Argento met in 1994 at the Rome Fanta Festival and surprisingly agreed to collaborate on a horror film called ''[[The Wax Mask]]'', a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', also based on a story called \"The Waxwork Museum\" by Gaston Leroux.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}} Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci's miserable circumstances at the time and wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their 1994 meeting, and said he felt very sorry for him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}}\n\nFulci collaborated with writer Daniele Stroppa to create a screenplay for Argento, and Argento kept trying to get them to increase the violence and gore quotient, against Fulci's wishes strangely. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci's earlier films, ''[[The House of Clocks]]'' and ''Voices from Beyond''). Fulci was slated to also direct the film, but sadly he died before filming could begin, due to a series of delays caused by Argento's involvement with his own project, ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', at the time. ''[[Wax Mask]]'' was eventually directed by former special effects artist [[Sergio Stivaletti]].{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=11}} The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci's death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci's original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci's daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=66}}\n\nLucio Fulci died alone, in his sleep, in his apartment in Rome at around 2 P.M. on the afternoon of 13 March 1996, from diabetes-related complications at the age of 68. Toward the end of his life, Fulci had lost his house and was forced to move into a cramped apartment. Since Fulci had been so despondent in his later years, some believed that he may have intentionally allowed himself to die by not taking his diabetes medication, but this is controversial.<ref>Balun, Charles (1997). Lucio Fulci: Beyond the Gates (2nd ed.). Fantasma Books.</ref> Dario Argento paid for Fulci's funeral arrangements.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=347}}\n\nFulci's films had remained generally ignored or dismissed for many years by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as [[exploitation film|exploitation]]. However, [[genre]] fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, ''The Beyond'', has \"amassed a large and dedicated following\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Glenn |title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |page=113 |isbn=1-55652-770-5}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Beyond'' was re-released to theaters by [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/features/beyondpiecespromo.htm |title=Grindhouse Releasing Presents '80s Horror Classics Pieces and The Beyond |work=DVD Drive-In |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as a major source of inspiration. Fulci's earlier, lesser-known giallo ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' and ''Beatrice Cenci'', as his best all-around work, and considered both ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989-1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.\n\nFulci made an appearance at the January 1996 [[Fangoria]] Horror Convention in New York City, two months before his death. Walking on crutches with a bandaged foot, he told attendees that he had had no idea his films were so popular outside of his native Italy, as hordes of starstruck gore fans braved blizzard conditions that weekend to meet him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=345}}\n\n== Fulci vs. Sacchetti ==\nFulci and screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] share many screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films were written by Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]'' in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was supposed to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.\n\nIn 1987, Fulci accused Sacchetti of stealing a story idea of his, a project which they were planning to do together in 1983 after Fulci returned from Mexico. He claimed that Sacchetti later allowed director [[Lamberto Bava]] to direct the project (under the title ''Per Sempre'' / ''Until Death'') in 1987 without Fulci's knowledge that the film was even being made. Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta's book ''Spaghetti Nightmares'', publishes two full interviews, one with Fulci and one with Sacchetti, explaining the reasons for the fallout.\n\nFulci's version is as follows: \"One day I told Dardano the plot of my ''Evil Comes Back'' (later retitled ''Per Sempre''/''Until Death''), a sequel on a fantastic note to ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and he proposed it to several producers with my name on it as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with ''his'' name on it! ''(laughs)'' I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer ([[Sergio Martino]]), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though.\"\n\nSacchetti's version differs: \"When I proposed to Lucio my original treatment for ''Per Sempre'', which was nothing more than a sequel to ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make ''[[The Changeling 2|Per Sempre]]'' and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that ''he'' originated the story and that I ''stole'' it from him is pure science fiction\".\n\n== Filmography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Film\n! colspan=\"3\"|Worked as\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\"|Notes\n|-\n! width=95 |[[Film director|Director]]\n! width=95 |[[Screenwriter|Writer]]\n! width=95 |[[Actor]]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"center\"| 1950\n| align=\"left\"| [[The Last Days of Pompeii (1950 film)|''The Last Days of Pompeii'' (1950 film)]] \n|{{yes}} (2nd unit director)\n|\n| \n| Italian: ''Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei''{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=282}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| rowspan=4 align=\"center\"| 1952\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 a colori''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 In Color''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e i Re di Roma''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n|\n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the King of Rome''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Fratelli d'Italia''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| {{yes}} (co-writer)\n|\n| English: ''Brothers of Italy''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| align=\"left\"| ''Tot\u00f2 e le donne''\n| {{yes}} (assistant director)\n| \n|\n| English: ''Tot\u00f2 and the Lady''<ref>Thrower, Stephen (1999).

His most notable films include the \"Gates of Hell\" trilogy\u2014''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), and ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981)\u2014as well as ''[[Massacre Time]]'' (1966), ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), ''[[White Fang (1973 film)|White Fang]]'' (1973), ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975), ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (1977), ''[[Zombi 2]]'' (1979), ''[[The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]''(1982), and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' (1990). Although a number of films over the years were said to have been \"co-produced\" by Fulci, in most cases he was just allowing them to use his name to promote the films (with the exception of ''City of the Living Dead'', which he did actively attempt to obtain funding for)<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 202.</ref>.\n\nBecause of the high level of visceral [[Splatter film|graphic violence]] present in many of his films, especially ''Zombi 2'', ''The Beyond'', ''Contraband'' and ''The New York Ripper'', Fulci is frequently referred to as \"The Godfather of Gore\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/fulci.htm|title=Lucio Fulci: Godfather of Gore|work=houseofhorrors.com|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> a title also given to [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].\n\n==Life and career==\nLucio Fulci was born in Trastavere, [[Rome]] on 17 June 1927. His mother Lucia was from a very poor but reputable [[Sicilians|Sicilian]], politically anti-fascist family, from [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. She had earlier eloped to Rome with a lover who later left her to raise their child (Lucio) alone. Lucio was raised by his mother and a female housekeeper. He attended the Naval College in Venice, and near the end of WW2, completed his studies back in Rome at the [[Giulio Cesare State Classical School]]. He was interested in art, music, film, soccer and always had a love for sailing.  <ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films.

He was in his young adult years a politically active radical for the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Fulci was even arrested by the police for demonstrating with the Communist Party. An assassination attempt on party leader Palmiro Togliatti caused a political crisis in Italy and calls for a general strike. After this incident, his relationship with his family became tense and chaotic and he lived an impoverished life for a time. \n\nHis mother encouraged him to be a lawyer, but he wound up going to medical school instead.<ref>Paolo Albiero & Giacomo Cacciatore: \"Dalla sinistra di via Veneto alla destra di Steno\" (1927-1958)</ref> <ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 /> After studying medicine for a time, he dropped out before completing his training, deciding that his true interests lay in cinema. He worked initially as an art critic, writing for Gazzetta delle Arti and Il Messaggero, and also joined the critical art group il Gruppo Arte Sociale.<ref name=FC1 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2004/great-directors/fulci|title=Lucio Fulci|last=MacCormack|first=Patricia|date=22 April 2004|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nHis interest in the arts led him to apply to the Centro Sperimentale (Rome's film school) where he apprenticed, after which he worked first as a director of documentaries, then an assistant director of motion pictures, then a screenwriter working mainly in the Italian [[comedy film|comedy]] field In the early 1950s. The famed Italian director [[Steno]] took Fulci under his wing and allowed him to assist in the making of a number of comedies starring [[Tot\u00f2]]<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press.</ref>. Fulci finally became a full-fledged movie director beginning with ''I Ladri'' in 1959. \n\nIn the 1960s, Fulci wrote or directed more than 30 Italian comedies<ref>Filmography section</ref>, eleven of them starring the famous Italian comedian team of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. Most of these early comedies did not enjoy distribution in English-speaking markets, and are thus generally unavailable today in English. Fulci's first film to be distributed theatrically in the USA was ''Oh! Those Most Secret Agents!'' in 1965. Only three of his other 1960s films were ever released in the U.S.: ''Massacre Time'' (released as ''[[The Brute and the Beast]]'' in 1968), ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (as ''[[One on Top of the Other]]'' in 1973) and ''Beatrice Cenci'' (as ''[[Conspiracy of Torture]]'', in 1976).\n\nFulci moved into directing [[giallo]] thrillers with ''[[Una sull'altra]]'' (1969), ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971) and ''[[Sette note in nero]]'' (''The Psychic'', 1977), as well as Spaghetti Westerns such as ''[[Four of the Apocalypse]]'' (1975) and ''[[Silver Saddle]]'' (1978), all of which were commercially successful and controversial in their depictions of graphic violence.  Some of the [[special effects]] in ''A Lizard in a Woman's Skin'' involving mutilated dogs in a vivisection room were so realistic that Fulci was dragged into court and charged with animal cruelty until he produced the artificial canine puppets that were used in the film (created by special effects maestro [[Carlo Rambaldi]]).<ref name=FC1 /><ref name=AD2 /><ref name=LAZ3 />\n\nHis first film to gain significant notoriety in his native country, ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling]]'' (1972), combined scathing social commentary with the director's trademark graphic violence.

His features released from 1979 through 1982 (most of them scripted by famed Italian screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]]) were described by some critics as being among the most violent and gory films ever made. ''[[City of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' (1981), ''[[The House by the Cemetery]]'' (1981), ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1981), ''[[The New York Ripper]]'' (1982) and ''[[Manhattan Baby]]'' (1982) were among his biggest hits, all of which were noted for their extreme content and significant amount of gore. Fulci also enjoyed acting, and indulged himself by giving himself cameo appearances in sixteen of the films he directed between 1967 and 1991.(See Filmography below). He also appeared in a cameo in a 1961 rock and roll film ''Sanremo - la Grande Sfida'' which he did not direct, and was featured on the film's one-sheet poster as well.<ref>Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. Filmography section</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies released in America were edited by the [[film distributor]] to ensure an [[MPAA film rating system|R rating]], such as ''The Beyond'', which was originally released on video in severely edited form as ''Seven Doors of Death''. Others were released Unrated in order to avoid an [[X-rating]] (as with ''Zombi 2'' and ''House by the Cemetery'') which would have restricted the films' target audiences to adults. The unrated films often played worldwide in [[drive-in theater|drive-ins]] and [[grindhouse]]s where they developed a cult following. Many of Fulci's horror films tend to contain \"injury to the eye\" sequences, in which a character's eyeball is either pierced or pulled out of its socket, usually in lingering, close-up detail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/3261090|title=No Eyes are Safe: Lucio Fulci|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>\n\nSeveral of Fulci's movies were prohibited in Europe or were released in heavily cut versions. Of the original 72 films on the infamous [[video nasty]] list in the United Kingdom, three belonged to Fulci: ''Zombi 2'' (1979), ''The Beyond'' (1981), and ''House by the Cemetery'' (1981). After viewing Fulci's ''The New York Ripper'', not only did the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refuse the film a certificate, but every single print in the country was taken to an airport and returned to Italy by order of [[James Ferman]]; it was not until later that [[VIPCO]] allowed the release of the film, initially outsourcing production to a foreign source under police supervision before releasing a [[VHS]] in 2002 and a [[DVD]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084719/trivia |title=The New York Ripper (1982) - Trivia |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter collaborating with screenwriter Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct the movie ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]''  (a Conan-like barbarian fantasy) in [[Mexico]], failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film did poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by that time had gone his own way.\n\nFulci became ill from hepatitis in 1984, right after he finished directing ''[[Murder Rock]]'' in New York City, and had to be hospitalized in Italy for many months. Fulci spent most of 1984 hospitalized with [[cirrhosis]], and much of 1985 recuperating at home. After 1986, with diabetes plaguing him and the departure of screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti from his circle of friends, Fulci's endeavors as a director suffered. \n\nIn 1988, he had directed about two-thirds of ''[[Zombi 3]]'' in the [[Philippines]] before having to return abruptly to Italy due to a second bout of hepatitis. The film was finished by an uncredited [[Bruno Mattei]]. Fulci later said that he hated the finished film and tried unsuccessfully to get his name removed from the credits. Mattei has said in interviews that the film was Fulci's, and that he (Mattei) just added a few extra scenes to pad out the running time.{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}\n\nIn 1989, Fulci was hired to direct a pair of made-for-TV horror movies for the Italian market, neither of which aired in Italy due to the high amount of gore and violence. They were released later on DVD, however, outside of Italy. Fulci's intended comeback films ''[[Demonia (film)|Demonia]]'' and ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]'' were produced in 1990. Both films struggled to get released and were considered critical disappointments. His final project, the 1991 psychological thriller ''[[The Door to Silence]]'', based on one of his own short stories, also received poor reviews. The release of this film is seen by some as the critical lowest point of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esplatter.com/reviews.php?id=22 |title=Horror Movie Review of Zombi 3 (Lucio Fulci) |last=Gore |first=Lucius |work=ESplatter |access-date=15 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the last decade of his life, Fulci suffered from emotional and physical health problems, reflected by a marked decline in the quality of his work. Fulci also continued to suffer during the late 1980s from reccurring problems with diabetes and his liver. He hid the severity of his illness from his friends and associates, so that he would not be deemed unemployable{{sfn|Thrower|1999}}. His wife's suicide in 1969 had always weighed heavily on him (his wife Marina had killed herself with a gas oven after learning she had inoperable cancer).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} People who knew Fulci well spoke of a third daughter he once had who he said was killed in a car accident in the 1970s, but this story was never confirmed, and the daughter's name (if in fact she existed) was never revealed by any of his biographers.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=46}} Fulci biographer Stephen Thrower wrote \"....the suicide of his wife in 1969 was followed not long after by the death of a daughter in a road accident.\" {{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=267}} Dario Argento is quoted in one book as saying of Fulci \"His life was terrible. His wife committed suicide, and his daughter was paralyzed because of an accident.\"{{sfn|Thrower|1999|p=268}}\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, Fulci made a deal with producers Antonio Lucidi and Luigi Nannerini to lend his name to the credits of some of their low-budget horror films that he had not even worked on, simply to make the films more marketable to foreign distributors.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} Although he did supervise the special gore effects in ''The Murder Secret'', and directed some additional footage to lengthen the running time of ''Hansel and Gretel'', he was hardly at all involved with some of the other projects which nonetheless bore the \"Lucio Fulci Presents\" label on their video display boxes.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=343}} The following year, in reciprocation for the use of his name, Fulci was permitted to use gore footage culled from these various films to make his infamous ''[[A Cat in the Brain]]''. Fulci tried unsuccessfully however to have his name removed from the credits of one film in particular, Gianni Martucci's ''[[The Red Monks]]'', since he said he had had no involvement whatsoever with the project (the film's producer Pino Buricchi begged him to let them put his name in the credits).{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=344}}\n\nIt could be argued that at his peak, Fulci's fame and popularity were on a par with that of [[Dario Argento]], another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci's publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded in his home country as something of a horror film \"hack\".{{sfn|Thrower|1999}} Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they even mentioned him at all.\n\nFulci and Argento met in 1994 at the Rome Fanta Festival and surprisingly agreed to collaborate on a horror film called ''[[The Wax Mask]]'', a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price horror classic ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'', also based on a story called \"The Waxwork Museum\" by Gaston Leroux.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}} Argento claimed he had heard about Fulci's miserable circumstances at the time and wanted to offer him a chance at a comeback. It is said that Argento was shocked at how thin and sickly Fulci appeared at their 1994 meeting, and said he felt very sorry for him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=65}}\n\nFulci collaborated with writer Daniele Stroppa to create a screenplay for Argento, and Argento kept trying to get them to increase the violence and gore quotient, against Fulci's wishes strangely. (Stroppa had co-written two of Fulci's earlier films, ''[[The House of Clocks]]'' and ''Voices from Beyond''). Fulci was slated to also direct the film, but sadly he died before filming could begin, due to a series of delays caused by Argento's involvement with his own project, ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', at the time. ''[[Wax Mask]]'' was eventually directed by former special effects artist [[Sergio Stivaletti]].{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=11}} The screenplay was entirely reworked by Stivaletti after Fulci's death, so the finished film contains significant changes to Fulci's original screenplay. Argento also hired Fulci's daughter Antonella to serve as an assistant art director on the film.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=66}}\n\nLucio Fulci died alone, in his sleep, in his apartment in Rome at around 2 P.M. on the afternoon of 13 March 1996, from diabetes-related complications at the age of 68. Toward the end of his life, Fulci had lost his house and was forced to move into a cramped apartment. Since Fulci had been so despondent in his later years, some believed that he may have intentionally allowed himself to die by not taking his diabetes medication, but this is controversial.<ref>Balun, Charles (1997). Lucio Fulci: Beyond the Gates (2nd ed.). Fantasma Books.</ref> Dario Argento paid for Fulci's funeral arrangements.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=347}}\n\nFulci's films had remained generally ignored or dismissed for many years by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as [[exploitation film|exploitation]]. However, [[genre]] fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, ''The Beyond'', has \"amassed a large and dedicated following\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Glenn |title=Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2008 |page=113 |isbn=1-55652-770-5}}</ref> In 1998, ''The Beyond'' was re-released to theaters by [[Quentin Tarantino]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddrive-in.com/features/beyondpiecespromo.htm |title=Grindhouse Releasing Presents '80s Horror Classics Pieces and The Beyond |work=DVD Drive-In |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as a major source of inspiration. Fulci's earlier, lesser-known giallo ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, ''Don't Torture a Duckling'' and ''Beatrice Cenci'', as his best all-around work, and considered both ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989-1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.\n\nFulci made an appearance at the January 1996 [[Fangoria]] Horror Convention in New York City, two months before his death. Walking on crutches with a bandaged foot, he told attendees that he had had no idea his films were so popular outside of his native Italy, as hordes of starstruck gore fans braved blizzard conditions that weekend to meet him.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=345}}\n\n== Fulci vs. Sacchetti ==\nFulci and screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] share many screen credits from 1977 to 1983. Indeed, most of Fulci's most celebrated horror films were written by Sacchetti. After collaborating with Sacchetti for six years, Fulci went off on his own in 1983 to direct ''[[Conquest (1983 film)|Conquest]]'' in Mexico, failing to involve Sacchetti in the deal. The film was supposed to be a high budget production, and Sacchetti allegedly resented the fact that Fulci had not thought to involve him in the project. The film actually wound up doing quite poorly upon its release, and afterwards, Fulci had trouble jump-starting his working relationship with Sacchetti, who by this time had gone his own way.\n\nIn 1987, Fulci accused Sacchetti of stealing a story idea of his, a project which they were planning to do together in 1983 after Fulci returned from Mexico. He claimed that Sacchetti later allowed director [[Lamberto Bava]] to direct the project (under the title ''Per Sempre'' / ''Until Death'') in 1987 without Fulci's knowledge that the film was even being made. Luca M. Palmerini and Gaetano Mistretta's book ''Spaghetti Nightmares'', publishes two full interviews, one with Fulci and one with Sacchetti, explaining the reasons for the fallout.\n\nFulci's version is as follows: \"One day I told Dardano the plot of my ''Evil Comes Back'' (later retitled ''Per Sempre''/''Until Death''), a sequel on a fantastic note to ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', and he proposed it to several producers with my name on it as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with ''his'' name on it! ''(laughs)'' I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer ([[Sergio Martino]]), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though.\"\n\nSacchetti's version differs: \"When I proposed to Lucio my original treatment for ''Per Sempre'', which was nothing more than a sequel to ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make ''[[The Changeling 2|Per Sempre]]'' and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations.

The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles. In particular, the [[tetrahedron|regular tetrahedron]] has four equilateral triangles for faces and can be considered the three-dimensional analogue of the shape.

Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\n\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points.

Because popular culture has that power in everyday life.\" (bell hooks On cultural criticism)\n\nHooks then continues on to explain that unlike critical theory that may be hard for a lot of people to access or understand, popular culture is able to reach the masses and be more likely to be easily understood by them. \u00a0Thus, it has become increasingly more popular for the masses to be educated by popular culture rather than theory based essays.\n\n'''Critical Thinking as Transformation:''' bell hooks states: \"I think thinking critically is at the heart of anybody transforming their life and I really believe that a person who thinks critically, who, you know, may be extraordinarily disadvantaged, materially, can find ways to transform their lives, that can be deeply and profoundly meaningful in the same way that someone who may be incredibly privileged materially and in crisis in their life may remain perpetually unable to resolve their life in any meaningful way if they don't think critically.\"\n\nShe then continues on to share her experience about \"teaching at very fancy private predominantly white schools to teaching at an urban, predominantly non-white campus in Harlem\". \u00a0Despite the variance of national academic rank, she states that students at both schools were brilliant, but the schools differentiated in how students saw themselves. Students at the prestigious schools knew their worth and had a sense of entitlement about their futures because so much has been promised to them in attending these schools. \u00a0While students at the Harlem school did not share their same sense of entitlement because nothing has been promised to them. \"It has more to do with their sense of entitlement about having a future and when I see among my really brilliant students in Harlem, many of whom have very difficult lives, they work, they have children, is that they don't have that sense of entitlement, they don't have that imagination into a future of agency and as such, I think many professors do not try to give them the gift of critical thinking\". \u00a0\n\n'''The Power of Representation:''' Hooks debates the direct link between representations(in pop culture)and how we live our lives, that are often denied, such as; the over-sexualized woman that obeys the male fantasy and black men always being cast as the villain. \u00a0\"I feel that it's frightening that as mass media uses more certain kinds of representations for specific impact and effect, we're also being told that these images are not really that important\".\n\n'''Motivated Representations:''' Hooks continues off of the last chapter ''The Power of Representation'' and tells more about how racist casting has been so commonly seen on screen and leads to more prejudice off-screen: \u00a0\"We look at the recent movie ''Smoke'' where the thief is a black kid. Now in the original script \u2013 it's based on the story by Paul Auster \u2013 in the story there's no racial identification of the character. So when I talk to Wayne Wang who directed the film, I said, \"Why did you choose to make the thief black?\" He putters and stutters around but he can't say, he will not say, because the only thing he can say is, \"This will give this movie more zip to make the thief black, it will make it more compelling to people. It will give a kind of good guy, bad guy quality to it and it will just make it all the more stimulating, because he would have to admit that the fact that he simultaneously in making that choice is also reproducing certain kinds of racial stereotypes.\" Nobody wants to lay claim to consciously constructing these images that perpetuate white supremacy, racism, etc. \u00a0And the ironic thing is that I can sit in classrooms in universities where my students don't want to accept that someone consciously creates that representation...A certain sense that reality is being documented and, again, you know, I think that part of the power of cultural criticism and cultural studies has been it's sort of political intervention as a force in American society to say, there really is a conscious manipulation of representations and it's not about magical thinking, it's not about like pure imagination, creativity, it's about people consciously knowing what kinds of images will produce a certain kind of impact\".\n\n'''An Example of Motivated Representation: ''Leaving Las Vegas'' & the Backlash Against Feminism:''' Hooks once again traces back to the chapter ''The Power of Representation'' by focusing on how woman are represented on film. \u00a0One of \"the most successful political movement in the United States over the last twenty years was really the feminist movement and that there is a tremendous backlash to feminism that is being enacted on the stage of mass media. \u00a0So that films like ''Leaving Las Vegas'' really are about ushering in a new old version of the desirable woman that really is profoundly misogynous based and sexist. It's no accident, we know that when women went into the factories in the World Wars because men were not here, that when those wars ended, mass media was used to get women out of the factory and back into the home, well in a sense mass media is being used in that very same way right now, to get women out of feminism and back into some patriarchal mode of thinking and movies to me are the lead propaganda machine in this right now\".\n\nIn Part Two, she demonstrates the value of cultural studies in concrete analysis through such subjects as the OJ Simpson case, Madonna, Spike Lee, and Gangsta rap. The aim of cultural analysis, she argues, should be the production of enlightened witnesses - audiences who engaged with the representations of cultural life knowledgeably and vigilantly.(Kanopy)\n\n'''Why \"White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy?\":''' Hooks breaks down why they coined the term White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy, which can be summarized by the following quotes: \"I began to use the phrase in my work 'white supremacist capitalist patriarchy' because I wanted to have some language that would actually remind us continually of the interlocking systems of domination that define our reality...To me an important break through, I felt, in my work and that of others was the call to use the term white supremacy, over racism because racism in and of itself did not really allow for a discourse of colonization and decolonization, the recognition of the internalized racism within people of color and it was always in a sense keeping things at the level at which whiteness and white people remained at the center of the discussion\".\n\n'''Enlightened Witness:''' This chapter focuses on being critical of what we see on screen and it can be summarized by the following quotes from the section: \u00a0\"And the issue is not freeing ourselves from representation. It's really about being enlightened witnesses when we watch representations, which means we are able to be critically vigilant about both what is being told to us and how we respond to what is being told...I don't think we will get much further in terms of decolonizing our minds. So that we can both resist certain kinds of conservatizing representation and at the same time create new and exciting representations.\n\n== Part Two: Doing Cultural Criticism ==\nIn Part Two, she demonstrates the value of cultural studies in concrete analysis through such subjects as the OJ Simpson case, Madonna, Spike Lee, and Gangsta rap. The aim of cultural analysis, she argues, should be the production of enlightened witnesses - audiences who engaged with the representations of cultural life knowledgeably and vigilantly.(Kanopy)\n\nPart two consists of:\n\n'''Constructed Narrative:''' In this passage, Hooks deconstructs the choices made in the production of a film that narrates how the work will be read. \u00a0Hooks makes a point that casting directors and other prominent people working on a film make conscious choices of casting and when certain types of people are routinely cast in the same position. \u00a0She makes a point that these routine types of molds people are cast in help to reinscribe stereotypes that are both harmful on and offscreen.\n\n'''Dealing with O.J.:''' bell hook's states that she felt the O.J. Simpson trial was a spectacle from the beginning to the end. This passage from Dealing with O.J. sums up this section well: \"The one time that I did go on television and I said that I could be on Good Morning America, and I could be asked about the O.J. Simpson case and it stipulated all beforehand that I could be asked one question, I was asked to just give my response, but they really wanted me to say, who was innocent and who was guilty. And what I said was that the only thing I really knew about the O.J. Simpson case was that it began and ended with male violence and that no one to my knowledge ever speculated that there were a bunch of women waiting outside that house to hack anybody to death, you know, cut the cameras, that's not the quote that anybody wanted to hear, they wanted the black woman to be choosing against the white woman or to be protecting the black man, they wanted this whole racialized scenario. When the issue is male violence against women, let's bring on some other kind of issue that makes us not pay real attention to male violence. And that's why race offered the perfect sort of screen to have another drama that everybody could be linked to\".\n\n'''Madonna: from Feminism to Patriarchy:''' This quote sums up this chapter: \u00a0\"Madonna always laid claim to being a female artist who was breaking new ground and in her own testimony laid claim to an engagement with feminist politics. A lot of times people act as though feminists bring an unwarranted critique to Madonna but I think Madonna receives so much attention from feminists precisely because she positioned herself as a woman within the music industry who was going to break new ground and who was going to challenge the sexism of that industry. And, as we know, for early on in her career she actually did live out that particular practice and that's I think, why many of us continue to have affection for her as a cultural icon even as we feel incredibly disturbed by the fact that stardom, which by its very nature has to be reproduced again and again, meant that at a certain point as an aging woman, Madonna had to have a new gimmick to renew interest in her, and it's not surprising that a major part of her re-invention of herself becomes a re-attachment to sexism\".\n\n'''Spike Lee: Hollywood's Fall Guy:''' This passage opens with: \"If I had talked about Spike Lee filmmaking before he made Girl 6, I would really be assessing him very differently from my assessment of him after he's made Girl 6 because I find Girl 6 to be a movie that not only challenges Hollywood, I feel that it's a critical read on Hollywood. I mean, that moment in the opening of the film you have Quentin Tarantino saying that he's going to make the best black film\". \u00a0She then critiques this aspect by saying: \"Black people aren't needed to produce black cinematic culture because white people can produce that culture and there's a lot of critiques of Hollywood and a certain value system in Girl 6 that Spike Lee himself has played along with in order to get to the position where he can use Hollywood as a vehicle to make certain critiques\". This section then continues on into Hollywood films about the black experience written and told by the white man and critiques their substance and validity.\n\n'''The Voyeur's Gaze:''' In this passage, bell hooks critiques the film Kids by Harmony Korine. \u00a0She states that despite all of the good things she heard about this film \"it seemed like the perfect embodiment of the kind of postmodern, notions of journeying and dislocation and fragmentation and yet when you go to see it, it has simply such a conservative take on gender, on race, on the politics of HIV...\"These to me were so much of the conservative strategies underlying the transgressive surface of the film and it's just another sad moment where people are seduced by transgression in and of itself, as though transgression makes you radical and not what you are transgressing in the service of\".\n\n'''Rap: Authentic Expression or Market Construct?: \"'''I mean one of the things that's amazing to me is that there has been this demand somehow that rap musicians be more moral and more ethical than anybody else in American culture as they approach the business of creating a product and making money. And for me this is not to condone the sexism and the misogyny of rap but it is to say that this has to be seen in the larger framework of cultural production within capitalism in our society and that far from being different from multinational corporations and their processes of gaining greater and greater wealth one might argue you know that rap musicians, especially the success of a certain kind of misogynistic anti-feminist, anti-woman rap, is totally in line with, if you find a product, that gives you the maximum profit and reward, then push that product whether you actually believe what you're saying or not. It seems to me that we must first acknowledge that they are making strategic choices and we must then critique both those choices and their impact. The damage in the long run to black life when pugilistic eroticism, when rape and assault become the defining aspects of erotic exchange between black females and males in youth culture, that fall out, that genocidal fallout is so much greater for the culture than the individual who becomes wealthy as a result of that, and the individuals surrounding that individual who perpetuate their wealth, the larger corporations who produce that music and give it to the world. And that's precisely why it's become very meaningless to talk about is there an 'authentic'? Is rap authentic? Because once you become part of the machinery of an advance technological capitalism system of production that is all out for the most profit, questions of authenticity become to me totally stupid and meaningless. Because it's already not anything that you can speak of any more as indigenous, it doesn't have a marginal location any more. So you can't talk about it as authentic to that marginal location because it's simply not there. It is 'authentic' then to what it is\".\n\n'''Color Coding Black Female Bodies:''' The entire passage from this section \"Well I think that rap videos, like all major videos right now, have reinscribed the female body in very traditionally sexist pornographic, within the framework of the traditional sexist pornographic imaginary. To the extent that rap music or any kind of black music uses more black female bodies, the black female body comes into greater representation solely along the sexual terms that we have historically been represented within mass media. The hot pussy, the prostitute, the slut, the vulgar girl, the girl who is willing to do what the nice girls won't do, etc. All of these images and representations that have been a function of racist and sexists stereotypes get reproduced in rap videos, but the most noticeable aspect of the objectification of black female bodies in rap videos, for black women and men is the color caste system gets reintroduced and affirmed. It's quite rare to see darker skinned black females among the groups of women that are seen as sexually viable and desirable in most music videos whether rap or otherwise because in fact, it is the light skinned, preferably long haired, preferably straightened haired female who becomes once again reinscribed as the desirable object, this again is one of the tragic dimensions right now of race in America because more than ever before color caste systems are being overtly affirmed as through, you know, we didn't change this, we didn't fight against it, so now all we can do is embrace it and live out the consequences of it\".\n\n'''Consuming Commodified Blackness:''' I believe that American culture is obsessed with transgression. And to the degree that blackness remains a primary sign of transgression, one could talk about American culture and mainstream culture as being obsessed with blackness, but it is blackness primarily in a commodified form that can then be possessed, owned, controlled, and shaped by the consumer and not with an engagement in black culture that might require one to be a participant and therefore to be in some way transformed by what you are consuming as opposed to being merely a buyer. Anecdotally that to me is the difference between a young white male from the suburb who's consuming black music in the form of rap and who's wearing the same kind of clothes as other, you know, hip hop musicians but then in fact when he encounters a young black male on the streets feels the same racialized fear and demonizes that person as any white person who's had no contact with that music, so that there's no correlation often between the consumption of the commodity that is blackness and the culture from which that commodity comes, or that provides the resource base and that's no different again from us thinking of Third World countries. There's a way in which white culture is perceived as too Wonder Bread right now, not edgy enough, not dangerous enough. Let's get some of those endangered species people to be exotic for us and it's really simply, I think, a more upscale version of primitivism, resurging. When blackness is the sign of transgression that is most desired it allow whiteness to remain static, to remain conservative, and its conservative thrust to go unnoticed. So as we're having a mounting Fascism in the United States that is perpetuated increasingly by liberal young, moneyed, liberal, white people, if they are wearing black clothes or listening to black music, they can be perceived as transgressive, as radical, when in fact, once again, we see a separation between material aspirations and cultural and social interests. So that at any point in time they can drop their interest in blackness and do whatever they need to do to reinforce their class interests, the interest of white supremacy, the interest of capitalism and imperialism and I think that this is frightening because it's so deep and profound. It really suggests the way in which fantasy will I think, more and more mediate Fascism as it has always done in the past. Pretend that you're going somewhere that you're not really going and you can stay in place and be ready to serve the state when the state calls you because you really haven't left home. And I think that's a lot of what's happening\".\n\n[[Category:Interviews]]\n", "text_old": "{{close paraphrasing|date=May 2019|source=https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Bell-Hooks-Transcript.pdf}}{{Multiple issues|{{unreferenced|date=May 2019}}{{primary sources|date=May 2019}}{{cleanup reorganize|date=May 2019}}{{lead too long|date=May 2019}}}}\n\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = bell hooks - Cultural Criticism And Transformation\n| director       = [[Sut Jhally]]\n| producer       = Sut Jhally\n| starring       = [[bell hooks]]\n| editing        = Mary Patierno, Sut Jhally & Harriet Hirshorn\n| distributor    = \n| released       = 1997\n| runtime        = \n}}\n\n'''''Cultural Criticism And Transformation''''' (1997), by bell hooks, is a two-part video that critiques stereotypical portrayals of race, gender and class in the media with extensive examples to back-up her criticism and in conclusion makes a compelling argument for the transformative power of cultural criticism.\n\nThe interview style film is divided into two parts. \u00a0Part one is titled ''On Cultural Criticism'' and is divided into seven sub-categories including\u00a0Why Study Popular Culture?,Critical Thinking as Transformation, the Power of Representation, Motivated Representations, an Example of Motivated Representation: ''Leaving Las Vegas'' & the Backlash Against Feminism, Why \"White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy?\", and Enlightened Witness.\n\nPart Two is titled ''Doing Cultural Criticism'' and consists of eight subcategories: Constructed Narrative, Dealing with O.J., Madonna: from Feminism to Patriarchy, Spike Lee: Hollywood's Fall Guy, the Voyeur's Gaze, Rap: Authentic Expression or Market Construct?, Color Coding Black Female Bodies, Consuming Commodified Blackness.\n\n== Part One -On Cultural Criticism ==\n'''Why Study Popular Culture?: \u00a0'''bell hooks briefly discusses her book ''Outlaw Culture'' in relation to her concerns with problematic patterns appearing in popular culture. \u00a0She tells how sometimes she found the best way to teach students or individuals about \"otherness\" was by relating it to a medium they were familiar with, the media and popular culture. \u00a0\"I related something very concrete in popular culture to the kind of theoretical paradigms that I was trying to share with them through various work, people seem to grasp it more and not only that, it would seem to be much more exciting and much more interesting for everybody.

It's really about being enlightened witnesses when we watch representations, which means we are able to be critically vigilant about both what is being told to us and how we respond to what is being told...I don't think we will get much further in terms of decolonizing our minds. So that we can both resist certain kinds of conservatizing representation and at the same time create new and exciting representations.\n\n== Part Two: Doing Cultural Criticism ==\nIn Part Two, she demonstrates the value of cultural studies in concrete analysis through such subjects as the OJ Simpson case, Madonna, Spike Lee, and Gangsta rap. The aim of cultural analysis, she argues, should be the production of enlightened witnesses - audiences who engaged with the representations of cultural life knowledgeably and vigilantly.(Kanopy)\n\nPart two consists of:\n\n'''Constructed Narrative:''' In this passage, Hooks deconstructs the choices made in the production of a film that narrates how the work will be read. \u00a0Hooks makes a point that casting directors and other prominent people working on a film make conscious choices of casting and when certain types of people are routinely cast in the same position. \u00a0She makes a point that these routine types of molds people are cast in help to reinscribe stereotypes that are both harmful on and offscreen.\n\n'''Dealing with O.J.:''' bell hook's states that she felt the O.J. Simpson trial was a spectacle from the beginning to the end. This passage from Dealing with O.J. sums up this section well: \"The one time that I did go on television and I said that I could be on Good Morning America, and I could be asked about the O.J. Simpson case and it stipulated all beforehand that I could be asked one question, I was asked to just give my response, but they really wanted me to say, who was innocent and who was guilty. And what I said was that the only thing I really knew about the O.J. Simpson case was that it began and ended with male violence and that no one to my knowledge ever speculated that there were a bunch of women waiting outside that house to hack anybody to death, you know, cut the cameras, that's not the quote that anybody wanted to hear, they wanted the black woman to be choosing against the white woman or to be protecting the black man, they wanted this whole racialized scenario. When the issue is male violence against women, let's bring on some other kind of issue that makes us not pay real attention to male violence. And that's why race offered the perfect sort of screen to have another drama that everybody could be linked to\".\n\n'''Madonna: from Feminism to Patriarchy:''' This quote sums up this chapter: \u00a0\"Madonna always laid claim to being a female artist who was breaking new ground and in her own testimony laid claim to an engagement with feminist politics. A lot of times people act as though feminists bring an unwarranted critique to Madonna but I think Madonna receives so much attention from feminists precisely because she positioned herself as a woman within the music industry who was going to break new ground and who was going to challenge the sexism of that industry. And, as we know, for early on in her career she actually did live out that particular practice and that's I think, why many of us continue to have affection for her as a cultural icon even as we feel incredibly disturbed by the fact that stardom, which by it's very nature has to be reproduced again and again, meant that at a certain point as an aging woman, Madonna had to have a new gimmick to renew interest in her, and it's not surprising that a major part of her re-invention of herself becomes a re-attachment to sexism\".\n\n'''Spike Lee: Hollywood's Fall Guy:''' This passage opens with: \"If I had talked about Spike Lee filmmaking before he made Girl 6, I would really be assessing him very differently from my assessment of him after he's made Girl 6 because I find Girl 6 to be a movie that not only challenges Hollywood, I feel that it's a critical read on Hollywood. I mean, that moment in the opening of the film you have Quentin Tarantino saying that he's going to make the best black film\". \u00a0She then critiques this aspect by saying: \"Black people aren't needed to produce black cinematic culture because white people can produce that culture and there's a lot of critiques of Hollywood and a certain value system in Girl 6 that Spike Lee himself has played along with in order to get to the position where he can use Hollywood as a vehicle to make certain critiques\". This section then continues on into Hollywood films about the black experience written and told by the white man and critiques their substance and validity.\n\n'''The Voyeur's Gaze:''' In this passage, bell hooks critiques the film Kids by Harmony Korine. \u00a0She states that despite all of the good things she heard about this film \"it seemed like the perfect embodiment of the kind of postmodern, notions of journeying and dislocation and fragmentation and yet when you go to see it, it has simply such a conservative take on gender, on race, on the politics of HIV...\"These to me were so much of the conservative strategies underlying the transgressive surface of the film and it's just another sad moment where people are seduced by transgression in and of itself, as though transgression makes you radical and not what you are transgressing in the service of\".\n\n'''Rap: Authentic Expression or Market Construct?: \"'''I mean one of the things that's amazing to me is that there has been this demand somehow that rap musicians be more moral and more ethical than anybody else in American culture as they approach the business of creating a product and making money. And for me this is not to condone the sexism and the misogyny of rap but it is to say that this has to be seen in the larger framework of cultural production within capitalism in our society and that far from being different from multinational corporations and their processes of gaining greater and greater wealth one might argue you know that rap musicians, especially the success of a certain kind of misogynistic anti-feminist, anti-woman rap, is totally in line with, if you find a product, that gives you the maximum profit and reward, then push that product whether you actually believe what you're saying or not. It seems to me that we must first acknowledge that they are making strategic choices and we must then critique both those choices and their impact. The damage in the long run to black life when pugilistic eroticism, when rape and assault become the defining aspects of erotic exchange between black females and males in youth culture, that fall out, that genocidal fallout is so much greater for the culture than the individual who becomes wealthy as a result of that, and the individuals surrounding that individual who perpetuate their wealth, the larger corporations who produce that music and give it to the world. And that's precisely why it's become very meaningless to talk about is there an 'authentic'? Is rap authentic? Because once you become part of the machinery of an advance technological capitalism system of production that is all out for the most profit, questions of authenticity become to me totally stupid and meaningless. Because it's already not anything that you can speak of any more as indigenous, it doesn't have a marginal location any more. So you can't talk about it as authentic to that marginal location because it's simply not there. It is 'authentic' then to what it is\".\n\n'''Color Coding Black Female Bodies:''' The entire passage from this section \"Well I think that rap videos, like all major videos right now, have reinscribed the female body in very traditionally sexist pornographic, within the framework of the traditional sexist pornographic imaginary. To the extent that rap music or any kind of black music uses more black female bodies, the black female body comes into greater representation solely along the sexual terms that we have historically been represented within mass media. The hot pussy, the prostitute, the slut, the vulgar girl, the girl who is willing to do what the nice girls won't do, etc. All of these images and representations that have been a function of racist and sexists stereotypes get reproduced in rap videos, but the most noticeable aspect of the objectification of black female bodies in rap videos, for black women and men is the color caste system gets reintroduced and affirmed. It's quite rare to see darker skinned black females among the groups of women that are seen as sexually viable and desirable in most music videos whether rap or otherwise because in fact, it is the light skinned, preferably long haired, preferably straightened haired female who becomes once again reinscribed as the desirable object, this again is one of the tragic dimensions right now of race in America because more than ever before color caste systems are being overtly affirmed as through, you know, we didn't change this, we didn't fight against it, so now all we can do is embrace it and live out the consequences of it\".\n\n'''Consuming Commodified Blackness:''' I believe that American culture is obsessed with transgression. And to the degree that blackness remains a primary sign of transgression, one could talk about American culture and mainstream culture as being obsessed with blackness, but it is blackness primarily in a commodified form that can then be possessed, owned, controlled, and shaped by the consumer and not with an engagement in black culture that might require one to be a participant and therefore to be in some way transformed by what you are consuming as opposed to being merely a buyer. Anecdotally that to me is the difference between a young white male from the suburb who's consuming black music in the form of rap and who's wearing the same kind of clothes as other, you know, hip hop musicians but then in fact when he encounters a young black male on the streets feels the same racialized fear and demonizes that person as any white person who's had no contact with that music, so that there's no correlation often between the consumption of the commodity that is blackness and the culture from which that commodity comes, or that provides the resource base and that's no different again from us thinking of Third World countries. There's a way in which white culture is perceived as too Wonder Bread right now, not edgy enough, not dangerous enough. Let's get some of those endangered species people to be exotic for us and it's really simply, I think, a more upscale version of primitivism, resurging. When blackness is the sign of transgression that is most desired it allow whiteness to remain static, to remain conservative, and it's conservative thrust to go unnoticed. So as we're having a mounting Fascism in the United States that is perpetuated increasingly by liberal young, moneyed, liberal, white people, if they are wearing black clothes or listening to black music, they can be perceived as transgressive, as radical, when in fact, once again, we see a separation between material aspirations and cultural and social interests. So that at any point in time they can drop their interest in blackness and do whatever they need to do to reinforce their class interests, the interest of white supremacy, the interest of capitalism and imperialism and I think that this is frightening because it's so deep and profound. It really suggests the way in which fantasy will I think, more and more mediate Fascism as it has always done in the past. Pretend that you're going somewhere that you're not really going and you can stay in place and be ready to serve the state when the state calls you because you really haven't left home. And I think that's a lot of what's happening\".\n\n[[Category:Interviews]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePart Two: Doing Cultural Criticism:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Criticism_and_Transformation"}
