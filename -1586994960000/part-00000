The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore is [[Grateful Dead]]'s gig at the [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Raceway Park]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey]] on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Rod Stewart]]'s show in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro, remains the highest-attended free concert with an estimated 3.5 million audience.\n\n==Highest-attended concerts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"|{{*|alt=Indicates the concert was the all-time highest attended up to that point}}\n|Indicates the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point\n|}\n\n===Single-artist concerts===\nThe following are the highest-attended single-artist's ticketed concerts (excluding [[music festival]]s) with attendance of 100,000 people or more.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Artist\n!align=left| Venue\n!

The oldest 100,000-crowd concert reported to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Boxscore is [[Grateful Dead]]'s gig at the [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Raceway Park]], [[Englishtown, New Jersey]] on September 3, 1977. The concert was attended by 107,019 people, which remains the largest ticketed concert in the United States to date. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Paul McCartney]] broke the record respectively in [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]]. With an audience of over 184,000 people on April 21, 1990. McCartney's record was broken by a Japanese rock band, GLAY, which held a concert with an audience of 200,000 people on July 31, 1999, in Chiba, Japan (Makuhari Parking Lot). GLAY held the record for 6 years. Italian singer [[Vasco Rossi]] surpassed McCartney's record with his solo concert on July 1, 2017. The concert was a celebration of his 40 years of career. Robbie Williams played to an audience of 135,000 in Phoenix Park, Dublin in Aug 2003. \n\nAlthough the attendance numbers of free concerts are known to be exaggerations,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> several concerts have been reported to have a million audience or more. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', [[Rod Stewart]]'s show in [[Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro|Copacabana Beach]], Rio de Janeiro, remains the highest-attended free concert with an estimated 3.5 million audience.\n\n==Highest-attended concerts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Key\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FAEB86\"|{{*|alt=Indicates the concert was the all-time highest attended up to that point}}\n|Indicates the concert was the highest-attended of all time up to that point\n|}\n\n===Single-artist concerts===\nThe following are the highest-attended single-artist's ticketed concerts (excluding [[music festival]]s) with attendance of 100,000 people or more.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Artist\n!align=left| Venue\n!
