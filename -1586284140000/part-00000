First years, or One-L's as they are often called, all face similar issues their first year of law school. Harvard, known for its reputation as one of the best law schools in the country, takes only about 12% of applicants<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/jdadmissions/apply-to-harvard-law-school/hls-profile-and-facts/|title=HLS Profile and Facts|last=School|first=Harvard Law|website=Harvard Law School|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>. Its grueling curriculum has been responsible for producing some of today's great thinkers. Some notable alumni of the law school are [[Barack Obama]], Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Ted Cruz]] and Associate Supreme Court Justice [[Elena Kagan|Elena Kagan.]] \n\nTurow recounts his time there, the professors and their classes that helped mold him into the lawyer, and writer, that he is today. Each professor has their very own distinctive teaching style and overall demeanor that Turow outlines very thoroughly. Professor William Zechman and his disorienting hypotheticals, Nick Morris, the young and progressive civil procedure professor who is well-liked among students, and Rudolph Perini, a notorious, brilliant bully in the court and classroom. \n\nAll of the characters, including the professors, were real educators at Harvard while Turow was attending. While he changed the names of all the characters, people have been able to figure out who Turow was referring to. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barbato|first=Joseph|date=1978|editor-last=Turow|editor-first=Scott|title=A Tale of Terror: Making It at Harvard Law|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40163137|journal=Change|volume=10|issue=2|pages=56\u201357|issn=0009-1383}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Characters   ==\n\n=== Scott Turow ===\nThe narrator of the novel. Previously a successful, young English teacher at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] with a deep affinity for law, he decided to take the LSAT on a whim. His score being astonishingly high gave him the room to decide where he wanted to go to School. Turow notes that he decided to choose Harvard Law based on their reputation for one of the most elite, despite the fact that many of his colleagues who had attended did not speak very highly of the school. Turow and his wife move to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and he begins classes in the fall of 1975. It is at Harvard that he \"meets his enemy.\"\n\n=== Nicky Morris ===\nOne of the notable professors at Harvard. Morris is known for his tranquil demeanor and unorthodox teaching style. Morris taught first year civil procedure at the university and was well liked among the students. Prior to teaching at Harvard, Morris had graduated at the age of 23 and developed a very impressive resume, including clerking for a Chief Justice. Morris was one of the easier professor who would call students based off the seating chart and offering them the option to pass on a question if they did not know the answer. Morris held a degree of contempt for the school and their teaching methods famously noting that he didn't please him that he was an educator at a place of higher learning that had been the root cause for the anguish and anxiety many alumni associate with their school. \n\n=== William Zechman ===\nA tort's professor who recently returned from a long absence and proves to be a bit of a mystery to his students. His class, while engaging, is a long series of elaborate hypotheticals that appear to be designed to confuse students, or at least that how it felt to Turow. While a kind and patient man, his classes often left his students befuddled trying to decrypt their incoherent notes.\n\n=== Rudolph Perini ===\nOne of Harvard's most notorious professors. One L's are warned immediately of his class and are encouraged to stay away. Whether it was the workload or his overbearing demeanor, students were not a fan of Perini or his class. A proud Texan and graduate from [[University of Texas School of Law|UT Law]], he made himself a large presence in any room that he was in. He had no issue with calling people out in class regardless of whether they wanted to participate or not. He encouraged students to remain at least three cases ahead of what the syllabus said, but it was implied that this was not merely a suggestion,.

First years, or One-L's as they are often called, all face similar issues their first year of law school. Harvard, known for its reputation as one of the best law schools in the country, takes only about 12% of applicants<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/jdadmissions/apply-to-harvard-law-school/hls-profile-and-facts/|title=HLS Profile and Facts|last=School|first=Harvard Law|website=Harvard Law School|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>. Its grueling curriculum has been responsible for producing some of today's great thinkers. Some notable alumni of the law school are [[Barack Obama]], Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Ted Cruz]] and Associate Supreme Court Justice [[Elena Kagan|Elena Kagan.]] \n\nTurow recounts his time there, the professors and their classes that helped mold him into the lawyer, and writer, that he is today. Each professor has their very own distinctive teaching style and overall demeanor that Turow outlines very thoroughly. Professor William Zechman and his disorienting hypotheticals, Nick Morris, the young and progressive civil procedure professor who is well-liked among students, and Rudolph Perini, a notorious, brilliant bully in the court and classroom. \n\nAll of the characters, including the professors, were real educators at Harvard while Turow was attending. While he changed the names of all the characters, people have been able to figure out who Turow was referring to. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barbato|first=Joseph|date=1978|editor-last=Turow|editor-first=Scott|title=A Tale of Terror: Making It at Harvard Law|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40163137|journal=Change|volume=10|issue=2|pages=56\u201357|issn=0009-1383}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Characters   ==\n\n=== Scott Turow ===\nThe narrator of the novel. Previously a successful, young English teacher at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] with a deep affinity for law, he decided to take the LSAT on a whim. His score being astonishingly high gave him the room to decide where he wanted to go to School. Turow notes that he decided to choose Harvard Law based on their reputation for one of the most elite, despite the fact that many of his colleagues who had attended did not speak very highly of the school. Turow and his wife move to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and he begins classes in the fall of 1975. It is at Harvard that he \"meets his enemy.\"\n\n=== Nicky Morris ===\nOne of the notable professors at Harvard. Morris is known for his tranquil demeanor and unorthodox teaching style. Morris taught first year civil procedure at the university and was well liked among the students. Prior to teaching at Harvard, Morris had graduated at the age of 23 and developed a very impressive resume, including clerking for a Chief Justice. Morris was one of the easier professor who would call students based off the seating chart and offering them the option to pass on a question if they did not know the answer. Morris held a degree of contempt for the school and their teaching methods famously noting that he didn't please him that he was an educator at a place of higher learning that had been the root cause for the anguish and anxiety many alumni associate with their school. \n\n=== William Zechman ===\nA tort's professor who recently returned from a long absence and proves to be a bit of a mystery to his students. His class, while engaging, is a long series of elaborate hypotheticals that appear to be designed to confuse students, or at least that how it felt to Turow. While a kind and patient man, his classes often left his students befuddled trying to decrypt their incoherent notes.\n\n=== Rudolph Perini ===\nOne of Harvard's most notorious professors. One L's are warned immediately of his class and are encouraged to stay away. Whether it was the workload or his overbearing demeanor, students were not a fan of Perini or his class. A proud Texan and graduate from [[University of Texas School of Law|UT Law]], he made himself a large presence in any room that he was in. He had no issue with calling people out in class regardless of whether they wanted to participate or not. He encouraged students to remain at least three cases ahead of what the syllabus said, but it was implied that this was not merely a suggestion,. He would verbally accost students who could not answer the questions; however, he had an amazing gift of making students think critically. Perini challenged students to explain and justify beliefs and values that were so central to their identities that they were nearly inarticulable. He often relied on the [[Socratic method]] of teaching, which a law review had referred to as \"public degradation, humiliation, ridicule, and dehumanization.\" They go on to say that \"Professor Perini of One-L has helped foster an image of the archetypal law school professor who challenges, probes and even humiliates students in repeated exchanges of questions and attempted answers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nebklr78&div=12&g_sent=1&casa_token=&collection=journals|title=Redirecting...|website=heinonline.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Mike Wald ===\nAn old college friend of Turows who he reconnected with once at Harvard Law.

Prior to 1973, the local government district had actually been a part of [[East Sussex]], but as a result of delayed implementation of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], it was almost wholly moved into [[West Sussex]].\n\nAt the 1983 general election, it gained some of the wards (including East Grinstead itself) previously contained in the East Grinstead constituency (which disappeared at that election, its last MP Geoffrey Johnson Smith contested and won the new seat of Wealden in East Sussex), and at the 1997 election, it gained many of the semi-rural wards with smaller communities between [[East Grinstead]] and [[Crawley]].\n\nFrom its creation in 1983 to the present, it has been a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat, with the primary opposition until the 2015 election being the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their predecessors the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In 2015, there was a severe fall in Liberal Democrats support. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s candidate come second in the seat for the first time in its history. In 2017, Labour consolidated this lead at the 2017 General Election by gaining almost double the votes of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the [[Results of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]], Mid Sussex voted for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union. Despite this, Soames called for MPs to back Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. However, he was one of the 21 Conservative rebels who voted to allow Parliament to vote to legislate to prevent a no deal Brexit on 3 September 2019, and subsequently became an independent, after the rebels had the Conservative whip removed. He then decided not to stand for re-election although he had the whip restored before dissolution.<ref>{{Cite

Prior to 1973, the local government district had actually been a part of [[East Sussex]], but as a result of delayed implementation of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], it was almost wholly moved into [[West Sussex]].\n\nAt the 1983 general election, it gained some of the wards (including East Grinstead itself) previously contained in the East Grinstead constituency (which disappeared at that election, its last MP Geoffrey Johnson Smith contested and won the new seat of Wealden in East Sussex), and at the 1997 election, it gained many of the semi-rural wards with smaller communities between [[East Grinstead]] and [[Crawley]].\n\nFrom its creation in 1983 to the present, it has been a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat, with the primary opposition until the 2015 election being the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their predecessors the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In 2015, there was a severe fall in Liberal Democrats support. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s candidate come second in the seat for the first time in its history. In 2017, Labour consolidated this lead at the 2017 General Election by gaining almost double the votes of the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the [[Results of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union referendum]], Mid Sussex voted for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union. Despite this, Soames called for MPs to back Theresa May's withdrawal agreement. However, he was one of the 21 Conservative rebels who voted to allow Parliament to vote to legislate to prevent a no deal Brexit on 3 September 2019, and subsequently became an independent, after the rebels had the Conservative whip removed. He then decided not to stand for re-election although he had the whip restored before dissolution.<ref>{{Cite

[[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]. There are multiple versions implementing a number of [[video codec]]s, such as [[HEVC]], [[VP9]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] and [[VP8]]. As with all ARM products, the Mali Video Processor is a [[semiconductor intellectual property core]] licensed to third parties for inclusion in their chips. Real time encode-decode capability is central to [[videotelephony]]. An interface to ARM's [[ARM architecture#TrustZone|TrustZone]] technology is also built-in to enable [[Digital Rights Management]] of [[copyright]]ed material.\n\n=== Mali-V500 ===\nThe first version of a Mali Video processor was the V500, released in 2013 with the Mali-T622 GPU.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lal Shimpi|first1=Anand|title=ARM MaliT622 V500 Video Block Complement Cortex A12|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7010/arm-malit622-v500-video-block-complement-cortex-a12|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Anandtech.com|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> The V500 is a multicore design, sporting 1\u20138 cores, with support for H.264 and a protected video path using [[ARM architecture#TrustZone|ARM TrustZone]].

[[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]. There are multiple versions implementing a number of [[video codec]]s, such as [[HEVC]], [[VP9]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] and [[VP8]]. As with all ARM products, the Mali Video Processor is a [[semiconductor intellectual property core]] licensed to third parties for inclusion in their chips. Real time encode-decode capability is central to [[videotelephony]]. An interface to ARM's [[ARM architecture#TrustZone|TrustZone]] technology is also built-in to enable [[Digital Rights Management]] of [[copyright]]ed material.\n\n=== Mali-V500 ===\nThe first version of a Mali Video processor was the V500, released in 2013 with the Mali-T622 GPU.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lal Shimpi|first1=Anand|title=ARM MaliT622 V500 Video Block Complement Cortex A12|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7010/arm-malit622-v500-video-block-complement-cortex-a12|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Anandtech.com|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> The V500 is a multicore design, sporting 1\u20138 cores, with support for H.264 and a protected video path using [[ARM architecture#TrustZone|ARM TrustZone]].

The film is based on two books, the 14th-century novel ''Fioretti Di San Francesco'' ''[[Little Flowers of St. Francis]]'' and ''La Vita di Frate Ginepro'' (The Life of Brother Juniper), both of which relate the life and work of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and the early [[Franciscan]]s. ''I Fioretti'' is composed of 78 small chapters. The novel as a whole is less biographical and is instead more focused on relating tales of the life of St. Francis and his followers. The movie follows the same premise, though rather than relating all 78 chapters, it focuses instead on nine of them. Each chapter is composed in the style of a parable, and, like parables, contains a moral theme. Every new scene transitions with a chapter marker, a device that directly relates the film to the novel. When the movie initially debuted in America, where the novel was much less known, on October 6, 1952, the chapter markers were removed.<ref name=\"imdb\">\"The Flowers of Saint Francis.\" IMDb. 2010 Wed. 12 Oct 2010 <https://www.imdb.com></ref>\n\n[[File:Nazario_Gerardi_as_St._Francis_in_Francesco,_giullare_di_Dio_2.jpg|thumb]]\n\nIncluded in the acting cast is Gianfranco Bellini as the narrator, who has voice-dubbed several American films for the Italian cinema.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Monks from the Nocere Inferiore Monastery played the roles of St. Francis and the friars.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Playing the role of St Francis is a Franciscan brother who is not credited, Brother Nazario Gerardi.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> The only professional actor in the film is the prominent [[Aldo Fabrizi]], who had worked with Rossellini before, notably in the neorealistic  film ''[[Rome, Open City]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> The film garnered international acclaim for Fabrizi.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> He began his film career scene in 1942, and is noted for both writing and directing his own vehicles. In this film, Fabrizi plays the role of Nicolaio, the tyrant of  Viterbo.<ref name=\"imdb\"/>\n\nRossellini had a strong interest in Christian values in the contemporary world.<ref name=\"Bondanella\">Bondanella, Peter. The Films of Roberto Rossellini. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1991. 16-17.

Morlion O.P., and Antonio Lisandri O.F.M.<ref name=\"Bondanella\"/> Though the priests contributed little to the script, their presence within the movie gave a feel of respectability in regards to theology.<ref name=\"Bondanella\"/> Morlion vigorously defended Catholic foundations within Italian neorealism, and felt that Rossellini's work, and eventually scriptwriter Fellini's, best captured this foundation.<ref name=\"Bondanella\"/>\n\n==Chapters==\n\nThe movie commences with an introduction to the Franciscan friars. This first part serves as a precursor to the main chapters, nothing more than an introduction of the humble Franciscans as they trudge through the mud in the pouring rain to their hut. They reach the shelter, only to find it occupied by a man and a donkey. Despite the Franciscans' best efforts, the old man insists the donkey remain with him in the shelter. He drives the Franciscans from their own hut, screaming that they have stolen the shelter. Thrust into the rain without shelter, the monks rejoice in their suffering, loving their vocation even more and discerning this to be the call whereby they are to follow Francis.\n\nThe rest of the film is divided into nine chapters each covering an incident in the life of St. Francis subsequent to his vocation.\n\n1 - How [[Saint Juniper|Brother Ginepro]] returned naked to [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]], where the Brothers had finished building their hut.\n\nThe first chapter is introduced by a parable and a chapter marker. It opens with the friars constructing a new hut. Two brothers return with a set of prayer bells, a gift from a generous donor. In the midst of their celebration, Brother Ginepro is found in the bushes without his tunic; he has given it away to a man in need. Francis instructs him never again to give away his meager garment without permission.\n\n2 - How Giovanni, known as \u201cthe Simpleton\u201d, asked to follow Francis and began imitating him in word and gesture.\n\nThe friars are running to meet Francis in the woods. They are leaving\u2014though before they go, Francis prays for these his children, wishing them to spread the Gospel by their example. Brother Ginepro is ordered to stay behind and cook for the friars. While the brothers attend to their tasks, Francis utters his famous prayer, \"O! Signore, fa di me uno strumento della tua Pace,\" in English, \"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.\"\n\nShortly after the prayer, an old man approaches the friar, bringing with him a gift of a bull. He wishes to abandon all for the sake of joining Francis, who questions him about his intentions. The old man simply states that he is willing to forsake everything to become a fellow Franciscan. Meanwhile, the man's family angrily arrives to reclaim the bull, and dismissively leave the burdensome elder behind with St Francis, who then introduces the friars to their newest brother, Brother Giovanni.\n\n3 - Of the wonderful meeting between [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] and St. Francis at St. Mary of the Angels.\n\nSaint Clare has expressed an ardent desire to dine with St Francis.  He accepts, and the brothers begin to search the forest for flowers so that they may honor this maiden of God. They find enough that they are able to construct a carpet of flowers. Francis and his brothers prepare a table of stone, and also garnish it with wildflowers. With the tools they have, they brush their hair, and trim their beards.\n\nA few moments later, Clare arrives with three of her sisters. Together, they and the friars enter the Chapel where Clare first professed her vows. They pray, and then they eat. The holiness of their conversation, as the narrator explains, ignites the sky with fire.\n\n4 - How Brother Ginepro cut off a pig\u2019s foot to give to a sick brother.\n\nBrother Ginepro is once again left behind while the other brothers are preaching and giving food to the poor. He and Brother Giovanni are tending to Brother Amarsebello, who has made himself sick from too much fasting. Ginepro makes Amarsebello a broth. Its taste is appalling, and so Ginepro asks Amarsebello what food would bring him comfort. Amarsebello asks for a pig's foot, and eager Ginepro consents to completing the task.\n\nGinepro searches the forest, praying to God to bring him a pig for his sick Brother. Ginepro soon stumbles upon some swine, and he asks one of the pigs to give up his foot.  The pig squeals. Brother Ginepro removes the foot and gives it to his sick brother.\n\nThe brothers return from their excursion, only to be confronted by the owner of the pig. He demands recompense; Francis makes Ginepro apologize. The owner does not accept his apology, but instead leaves in silence. Moments later, the pig's owner returns with the pig draped over his shoulders. He gives it to the friars, but warns them never to touch his swine again.\n\n5 - How Francis, praying one night in the woods, met the leper.\n\nFrancis is lying alone in the woods, meditating on the passion and love of God. The sound of bells captures his attention, and he is compelled to find the source. In the distance,  Francis spots a lone traveler. Upon closer examination, he recognizes the traveler to be a leper.  He devotedly follows the leper, and, despite the leper's pushing him away, persists in kissing and adoring the diseased man. Filled with awe, Francis collapses on the ground, praising God for the encounter with the leper.\n\n6 - How Brother Ginepro cooked enough food for two weeks, and Francis moved by his zeal gave him permission to preach.\n\nTired of not being able to join the brothers when they preach, Brother Ginepro decides to cook all of the food that the Franciscans have accumulated into a broth. The broth will last for two weeks, thus granting Ginepro the freedom to preach instead of cooking supper for the brothers. Francis then grants Ginepro permission to preach, on the condition that he begin each sermon with these words, \"I talk and talk yet I accomplish little.\"\n\n7 - How Brother Ginepro was judged on the gallows, and how his humility vanquished the ferocity of the tyrant Nicalaio.\n\nThis chapter focuses exclusively on Brother Ginepro as he travels around Italy, trying to find someone who will listen to his preaching. He stumbles upon some children, who inform him that the tyrant Nicolaio has just occupied a neighboring town. Excited by the new opportunity, Brother Ginepro rushes to the village and attempts to preach. The barbarians are amused by the small friar, and so they play with him. They throw him, and use him as a jump rope for their own amusement. It is here that Ginepro has an epiphany, that one must preach not by words, but by example..\n\nBrother Ginepro is brought before the tyrant. The barbarians search him, and discover an awl and flint. Nicolaio orders the barbarians to beat Ginepro with clubs. They bind his hands with rope and tie him to a horse. Once he is properly beaten, they bring Ginepro to the block for his execution. In mercy, they allow him to see a priest, who immediately recognizes him as a follower of St Francis. The priest pleads with Nicolaio to spare Ginepro. Nicolaio is reluctant to do this, for he was told that a man dressed as a beggar would come to kill him, and the assassin would be recognized by the very tools Ginepro possesses.\n\nNicolaio hosts a private audience with Ginepro in order to try to get to the truth of the matter.  He is ultimately foiled by Ginepro's humility.\n\n8 - How Brother Francis and [[Brother Leo]]n experienced those things that are perfect happiness.\n\nPerhaps the most famous chapter in ''I Fioretti'', this parable explains how one can truly be happy. St Francis posits many scenarios that would be considered to bring happiness: restoring sight to the blind, healing the crippled, casting out demons, converting heretics, and the like. But after each scenario, Francis calmly explains that none of these acts would bring perfect happiness.\n\nExasperated by the scenarios, Brother Leone begs Francis finally to tell him what in truth will bring such happiness. Francis points to a building, and hopes that the Lord will show them the perfect bliss Francis has in mind. They knock on the door, and ask the man inside for alms. He refuses them, yet the friars persist, claiming that they wish to praise Jesus with him. The man returns their pleas with several beatings from a club. Once the man has finished, Francis turns to Brother Leone and explains that this is perfect happiness: to suffer and bear every evil deed out of love for Christ.\n\n9 - How St. Francis left St. Mary of the Angels with his friars and traveled the world preaching peace.\n\nNow it is time for the brothers to part, each called to go his own way to spread the message of the Gospel. The friars give away their farm to the townsfolk. They walk to a nearby town, and give to the citizens all of their food. Once the food is gone, the friars take a moment to pray together one last time.\n\nFrancis leads the friars into the woods. The friars are unsure which direction to go, so Francis instructs them to spin in circles until they fall over from dizziness. Whichever direction they face when they fall is the way which God desires them to preach. The Franciscans depart, singing a chant as they travel the world preaching the peace of Christ.\n\n==Cast==\n* Brother Nazario Gerardi as [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]\n* Brother Severino Pisacane as Brother Ginepro\n* Esposito Bonaventura as Giovanni\n* [[Aldo Fabrizi]] as Nicolaio, the tyrant\n* Arabella Lema\u00eetre as [[Saint Clare of Assisi]]\n* Brother Nazareno, Brother Raffaele and Brother Robert Sorrentino as Franciscans\n* [[Gianfranco Bellini]] as the narrator\n\n==Production==\nRossellini had been working on a film about St. Francis for years and he later called this film his favorite of his own works.<ref name=\"Gallagher_340\">Gallagher, Tag.

The film is based on two books, the 14th-century novel ''Fioretti Di San Francesco'' ''[[Little Flowers of St. Francis]]'' and ''La Vita di Frate Ginepro'' (The Life of Brother Juniper), both of which relate the life and work of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]] and the early [[Franciscan]]s. ''I Fioretti'' is composed of 78 small chapters. The novel as a whole is less biographical and is instead more focused on relating tales of the life of St. Francis and his followers. The movie follows the same premise, though rather than relating all 78 chapters, it focuses instead on nine of them. Each chapter is composed in the style of a parable, and, like parables, contains a moral theme. Every new scene transitions with a chapter marker, a device that directly relates the film to the novel. When the movie initially debuted in America, where the novel was much less known, on October 6, 1952, the chapter markers were removed.<ref name=\"imdb\">\"The Flowers of Saint Francis.\" IMDb. 2010 Wed. 12 Oct 2010 <https://www.imdb.com></ref>\n\n[[File:Nazario_Gerardi_as_St._Francis_in_Francesco,_giullare_di_Dio_2.jpg|thumb]]\n\nIncluded in the acting cast is Gianfranco Bellini as the narrator, who has voice-dubbed several American films for the Italian cinema.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Monks from the Nocere Inferiore Monastery played the roles of St. Francis and the friars.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Playing the role of St Francis is a Franciscan brother who is not credited, Brother Nazario Gerardi.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> The only professional actor in the film is the prominent [[Aldo Fabrizi]], who had worked with Rossellini before, notably in the neorealistic  film ''[[Rome, Open City]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> The film garnered international acclaim for Fabrizi.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> He began his film career scene in 1942, and is noted for both writing and directing his own vehicles.

This first part serves as a precursor to the main chapters, nothing more than an introduction of the humble Franciscans as they trudge through the mud in the pouring rain to their hut. They reach the shelter, only to find it occupied by a man and a donkey. Despite the Franciscans' best efforts, the old man insists the donkey remain with him in the shelter. He drives the Franciscans from their own hut, screaming that they have stolen the shelter. Thrust into the rain without shelter, the monks rejoice in their suffering, loving their vocation even more and discerning this to be the call whereby they are to follow Francis.\n\nThe rest of the film is divided into nine chapters each covering an incident in the life of St. Francis subsequent to his vocation.\n\n1 - How [[Saint Juniper|Brother Ginepro]] returned naked to [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]], where the Brothers had finished building their hut.\n\nThe first chapter is introduced by a parable and a chapter marker. It opens with the friars constructing a new hut. Two brothers return with a set of prayer bells, a gift from a generous donor. In the midst of their celebration, Brother Ginepro is found in the bushes without his tunic; he has given it away to a man in need. Francis instructs him never again to give away his meager garment without permission.\n\n2 - How Giovanni, known as \u201cthe Simpleton\u201d, asked to follow Francis and began imitating him in word and gesture.\n\nThe friars are running to meet Francis in the woods. They are leaving\u2014though before they go, Francis prays for these his children, wishing them to spread the Gospel by their example. Brother Ginepro is ordered to stay behind and cook for the friars. While the brothers attend to their tasks, Francis utters his famous prayer, \"O! Signore, fa di me uno strumento della tua Pace,\" in English, \"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace.\"\n\nShortly after the prayer, an old man approaches the friar, bringing with him a gift of a bull. He wishes to abandon all for the sake of joining Francis, who questions him about his intentions. The old man simply states that he is willing to forsake everything to become a fellow Franciscan. Meanwhile, the man's family angrily arrives to reclaim the bull, and dismissively leave the burdensome elder behind with to St Francis, who then introduces the friars to their newest brother, Brother Giovanni.\n\n3 - Of the wonderful meeting between [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] and St. Francis at St. Mary of the Angels.\n\nSaint Clare has expressed an ardent desire to dine with St Francis.  He accepts, and the brothers begin to search the forest for flowers so that they may honor this maiden of God. They find enough that they are able to construct a carpet of flowers. Francis and his brothers prepare a table of stone, and also garnish it with wildflowers. With the tools they have, they brush their hair, and trim their beards.\n\nA few moments later, Clare arrives with three of her sisters. Together, they and the friars enter the Chapel where Clare first professed her vows. They pray, and then they eat. The holiness of their conversation, as the narrator explains, ignites the sky with fire.\n\n4 - How Brother Ginepro cut off a pig\u2019s foot to give to a sick brother.\n\nBrother Ginepro is once again left behind while the other brothers are preaching and giving food to the poor. He and Brother Giovanni are tending to Brother Amarsebello, who has made himself sick from too much fasting. Ginepro makes Amarsebello a broth. Its taste is appalling, and so Ginepro asks Amarsebello what food would bring him comfort. Amarsebello asks for a pig's foot, and eager Ginepro consents to completing the task.\n\nGinepro searches the forest, praying to God to bring him a pig for his sick Brother. Ginepro soon stumbles upon some swine, and he asks one of the pigs to give up his foot.  The pig squeals. Brother Ginepro removes the foot and gives it to his sick brother.\n\nThe brothers return from their excursion, only to be confronted by the owner of the pig. He demands recompense; Francis makes Ginepro apologize. The owner does not accept his apology, but instead leaves in silence. Moments later, the pig's owner returns with the pig draped over his shoulders. He gives it to the friars, but warns them never to touch his swine again.\n\n5 - How Francis, praying one night in the woods, met the leper.\n\nFrancis is lying alone in the woods, meditating on the passion and love of God. The sound of bells captures his attention, and he is compelled to find the source. In the distance,  Francis spots a lone traveler. Upon closer examination, he recognizes the traveler to be a leper.  He devotedly follows the leper, and, despite the leper's pushing him away, persists in kissing and adoring the diseased man. Filled with awe, Francis collapses on the ground, praising God for the encounter with the leper.\n\n6 - How Brother Ginepro cooked enough food for two weeks, and Francis moved by his zeal gave him permission to preach.\n\nTired of not being able to join the brothers when they preach, Brother Ginepro decides to cook all of the food that the Franciscans have accumulated into a broth. The broth will last for two weeks, thus granting Ginepro the freedom to preach instead of cooking supper for the brothers. Francis then grants Ginepro permission to preach, on the condition that he begin each sermon with these words, \"I talk and talk yet I accomplish little.\"\n\n7 - How Brother Ginepro was judged on the gallows, and how his humility vanquished the ferocity of the tyrant Nicalaio.\n\nThis chapter focuses exclusively on Brother Ginepro as he travels around Italy, trying to find someone who will listen to his preaching. He stumbles upon some children, who inform him that the tyrant Nicolaio has just occupied a neighboring town. Excited by the new opportunity, Brother Ginepro rushes to the village and attempts to preach. The barbarians are amused by the small friar, and so they play with him.

He is ultimately foiled by Ginepro's humility.\n\n8 - How Brother Francis and [[Brother Leo]]n experienced those things that are perfect happiness.\n\nPerhaps the most famous chapter in ''I Fioretti'', this parable explains how one can truly be happy.

The by-election had originally recorded 153 votes for both him and his rival, [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|William Brett]], but Campbell was declared elected after the Returning officer (who was the father of his election agent) cast a vote for him, after consulting a legal textbook which suggested he could make the casting vote.\n\nA petition was lodged, and a committee decided the returning officer had no right to cast the vote and should have declared both candidates elected. However, on scrutiny one vote was taken from Campbell's total, leaving Brett elected alone.

Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful.

Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})<sub>n</sub> was established by [[August Kekul\u00e9|Kekul\u00e9]] in 1858.<ref>{{cite journal |author=F. G.

Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP\u2014glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding \u03b1(1\u21924)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.<ref>Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)</ref>\n\nThe [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.\n\n===Breakdown===\n{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}\nGlycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:\n\n[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]\n\nIn vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.<ref>Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)</ref> Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the \u03b1(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:\n* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.\n* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.\n* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.\n\n==Clinical relevance==\n\n===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===\nThe most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.\n\nIn [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.\n\nVarious [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.\n\n===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===\n{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}\nLong-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[hitting the wall]]\".\n\nGlycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition [[type I muscle]] fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html | title=Methods of Endurance Training Part 1| date=2009-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html | title=Steady State vs. Tempo Training and Fat Loss| date=2008-06-02}}</ref> sparing carbohydrate use from all sources.

Freeman and Company (p. 618)</ref>\n\nThe [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.\n\n===Breakdown===\n{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}\nGlycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:\n\n[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]\n\nIn vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.<ref>Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)</ref> Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the \u03b1(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:\n* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.\n* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.\n* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.\n\n==Clinical relevance==\n\n===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===\nThe most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.\n\nIn [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.\n\nVarious [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.\n\n===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===\n{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}\nLong-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as \"[[hitting the wall]]\".\n\nGlycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition [[type I muscle]] fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html | title=Methods of Endurance Training Part 1| date=2009-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html | title=Steady State vs. Tempo Training and Fat Loss| date=2008-06-02}}</ref> sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017|date=2012-07-25 }}</ref><ref>McDonald, Lyle.
