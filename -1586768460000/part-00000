It is on an [[alluvial plain]] set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the [[Whanganui River]], 65&nbsp;km south of [[Te Kuiti]] and 55&nbsp;km west of [[Turangi]]. It is under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Ruapehu District]] and [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nIts population is 4,503 (2013 census, this is down 11% from the 2006 census), making it the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on [[New Zealand State Highway 4|State Highway 4]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway.\n\nThe name ''Taumarunui'' is reported to be the dying words of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Pehi Turoa \u2013 ''taumaru'' meaning screen and ''nui'' big, literally translated as Big Screen,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 M\u0101ori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean \u2013 \"The place of big shelter\".  There are also references to Taumarunui being known as large sheltered location for growing [[Sweet potato|kumara]].\n\nIn the 1980s publication ''Roll Back the Years'' there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollbacktheyears.co.nz/samples/vol1.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |title=How Taumarunui got its name |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=Roll Back the Years}}</ref> Extract: \"According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the ''Taumarunui Press'' in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]] to [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town's economy has been based on [[forestry]] and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high quality golf course.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n====1800s====\n*  1862, 8/9 February \u2013 [[Coutts Crawford|James Coutts Crawford]] visits, was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the [[Whangaehu River|Wangaehu]] bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/recollectionstr00coutgoog |title=Recollections of travel in New Zealand and Australia : Crawford, James Coutts : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1864 \u2013 Boundaries of the [[King Country]] drawn and European settlement is prohibited.<!-- \"Switching on the King Country\" - Hellen Reilly -->\n* 1869 \u2013 [[Te Kooti]] in Taumarunui.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18700118.2.32 |title=Papers Past \u2014 Colonist \u2014 18 January 1870 \u2014 IMPORTANT FROM WAIKATO |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1871 \u2013 [[Thomas McDonnell]] in area following up on reports of gold.

It is on an [[alluvial plain]] set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the [[Whanganui River]], 65&nbsp;km south of [[Te Kuiti]] and 55&nbsp;km west of [[Turangi]]. It is under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Ruapehu District]] and [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nIts population is 4,503 (2013 census, this is down 11% from the 2006 census), making it the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on [[New Zealand State Highway 4|State Highway 4]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway.\n\nThe name ''Taumarunui'' is reported to be the dying words of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Pehi Turoa \u2013 ''taumaru'' meaning screen and ''nui'' big, literally translated as Big Screen,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 M\u0101ori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean \u2013 \"The place of big shelter\".  There are also references to Taumarunui being known as large sheltered location for growing [[Sweet potato|kumara]].\n\nIn the 1980s publication ''Roll Back the Years'' there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollbacktheyears.co.nz/samples/vol1.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |title=How Taumarunui got its name |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=Roll Back the Years}}</ref> Extract: \"According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the ''Taumarunui Press'' in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]] to [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town's economy has been based on [[forestry]] and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high quality golf course.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n====1800s====\n*  1862, 8/9 February \u2013 [[Coutts Crawford|James Coutts Crawford]] visits, was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the [[Whangaehu River|Wangaehu]] bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/recollectionstr00coutgoog |title=Recollections of travel in New Zealand and Australia : Crawford, James Coutts : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1864 \u2013 Boundaries of the [[King Country]] drawn and European settlement is prohibited.<!-- \"Switching on the King Country\" - Hellen Reilly -->\n* 1869 \u2013 [[Te Kooti]] in Taumarunui.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18700118.2.32 |title=Papers Past \u2014 Colonist \u2014 18 January 1870 \u2014 IMPORTANT FROM WAIKATO |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1871 \u2013 [[Thomas McDonnell]] in area following up on reports of gold.

Both parts began shooting simultaneously, but production on the sequel was halted partway through due to budget and time constraints.

The film and its first sequel were originally conceived as one film, with Zod and his evil conspirators returning later in the film to challenge Superman, but the screenplay was so long that the producers elected to split it into two parts. Both parts began shooting simultaneously, but production on the sequel was halted partway through due to budget and time constraints. Stamp reappeared as General Zod in the second part, ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980), as the movie's primary villain. Donner was replaced as director on the sequel with [[Richard Lester]], who completed the film using portions of Donner's original footage combined with newly filmed scenes.

In 2003, Stamp returned to the ''Superman'' franchise in a new role, by portraying the voice of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]]'s biological father [[Jor-El]] in the [[WB Television Network|WB]]/[[The CW Television Network|CW]] television series ''[[Smallville]]''. He also provided the scream of Zod (being exorcised from the body of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]]) in the sixth-season premiere episode \"Zod\". In 2006, he appeared as Zod once again in ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'' (a retooled version of the 1980 film which features footage shot by Donner, the film's original director).\n\n===Recent years===\nIn recent years, Stamp has appeared in the films ''[[Ma femme est une actrice]]'' (aka ''My Wife Is An Actress'', 2001), ''[[My Boss's Daughter]]'' (2003), Disney's ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]'' (2003), and the superhero fantasy ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005).
