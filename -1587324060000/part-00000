The final season was released in 2018, but is still available via reruns.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Dr. Claw is thawed out of his iceberg prison and reactivates M.A.D., Inspector Gadget is brought out of retirement and is back on the beat to stop Dr. Claw once again, but this time, with Penny and Brain officially by his side. A new character in this series is Dr. Claw's nephew, Talon. Penny has a slight crush on him, and vice versa. The series is even more comical, cartoony and slapsticky than the original, with Dr. Claw being portrayed as much less sinister and Gadget a lot more inept and bumbling.\n\n==Characters==\n===HQ===\n* '''Inspector Gadget''' (voiced by Ivan Sherry) - Inspector Gadget is still the same powerful but unintelligent, gullible, and incompetent cyborg he was before, but now he's accompanied by Penny on his missions. As always, he's the bumbling \"hero\", only inadvertently saving the day and typically leaving a path of destruction in doing so. While he loves his niece, he still generally doesn't listen to Penny, even though she's his new assistant. Gadget is noticeably more egotistical than he was in the original series. He also has a new Gadget Mobile (since the old one turned to dust after he repeatedly jinxed its condition), which is snug and more efficient that the previous.\n* '''Penny''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) - Penny is Inspector Gadget's niece, an agent in training. She is brave, clever and willing to fight villains. She has a crush on Talon, Dr. Claw's nephew. Despite her crush, she never lets him get away with his and his uncle's evil plans. Unlike other Inspector Gadget productions, she now joins Gadget in his assignments and despite the show's title, she is effectively the protagonist. Also unlike the 80's series, she is a relatively adept fighter, only seldomly getting caught by M.A.D. agents. Penny is still typically the one who really saves the day but never gets any recognition for it, generally happy to let her uncle take all the credit for completing the mission. Penny acts like a normal teenage girl when she's not on duty. Her computer book and watch have been replaced with a holographic tablet called the codex. Her middle name is Ruth.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Inspector Gadget |title=Evil U |quote=If my middle name wasn't Ruth it would be Ruthless |author=Penny}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=Inspector Gadget |title=Brain Drain}} Penny: \"What's my middle name?\" Talon: \"Ruth! What? I follow you on MySpySpace.\"</ref> In International versions, she is called '''Sophie'''.\n* '''Brain''' (voiced by [[John Wayne]]) - Brain is Penny's dog, best friend and her sidekick and he always accompanies her to every mission. As always, he is a master of disguise and usually Gadget mistakes him for a M.A.D.-Agent and tries to apprehend him (even when Brain is attempting to save him or when Penny tries to tell him it's really Brain). In International versions, he is called '''Fino'''.\n* '''Chief Quimby''' (voiced by [[Derek McGrath]]) - Chief Quimby is the leader of the HQ and always gets Gadget and Penny their missions. To manage this, he always appears at the strangest places. This time, instead of paper, his self-destructing messages are now holographic. Chief Quimby now wears glasses and a coat and his hair is blonde instead of brown. He is a lot more patient than he was in previous iterations of the show. In the International versions, he is named '''Chief Gontier'''.\n* '''Professor Von Slickstein''' (voiced by [[Henry Winkler]]) - Professor Von Slickstein is an HQ scientist is portrayed as a young man, rather than a man in his late 60's in the original series. In the German version, he is named '''Professor Rotoskop'''.\n* '''Kayla''' (voiced by [[Katie Griffin]]) - Penny's best friend, another new character and a fellow agent in training. Her cheerful and positive personality is only matched by her gift for being a blabbermouth, her motor mouth is strong enough to cripple even the toughest M.A.D.-goon. In the German version, she's called '''Karla'''.\n\n===M.A.D.===\n* '''Dr. Claw''' (voiced by Martin Roach) - As always, he wants to take over the world and destroy Gadget. This time, he has help from his nephew Talon who rescued him from his iceberg prison in the first episode. As always, his face is never shown (but his torso does appear now and then). His full name is revealed to be \"Irving Thelonious Claw, Jr.\" In the German version, he's called '''Dr. (Boris) Kralle'''; in the French version, he is called '''Dr. Gang'''.\n* '''MAD Cat''' - Unlike Dr. Claw's previous MAD Cats, this one is female. She is spoiled by Dr. Claw and shares a feud with Talon.\n* '''Talon''' (voiced by Lyon Smith) - Introduced in this series, Talon is Dr. Claw's evil nephew who rescued him in the first episode. He is clever, handsome and manipulative. Talon is aware of his handsomeness and knows how to apply it. He secretly has a crush on Penny, but they cannot be together because they're enemies. In each possible situation that Talon wants to impress Penny, she mostly ignores him. Talon is one of a very small handful of M.A.D. agents who is aware that it's generally Penny, not Gadget, who foils M.A.D.'s plots. Even his uncle is oblivious to this fact. Talon is always arguing with his uncle because he considers his plans to be rather old-fashioned (although there's really nothing wrong with that) or just ridiculous, which is true. His uncle always blames him when his plans fail, even when it's not Talon's fault. There are even situations when Dr. Claw blames Talon for something his nephew has warned him of. Although he does everything to impress his uncle, he isn't treated very well by him. In the German version, he is named Titus. In the French version, he is called '''Tristan'''. In the Spanish version, he is called '''Garra'''. In the Russian version, he is called '''Claw''' in some series \n* '''Mama Claw''' (voiced by Martin Roach) - Maryland Claw is Dr. Claw's mother and Talon's grandmother. From her constant nagging, she often embarrasses her son because Dr. Claw is taking orders from someone who's not him and often tries to get Dr. Claw and Talon to improve themselves. Mama Claw appeared in a few episodes. Like Dr. Claw, her face is never seen, but the back of her head hair and ears do appear now and then.\n* '''M.A.D. Henchmen''' (Various Voices) - The generic henchmen of M.A.D.\n\n====M.A.D. Agents====\n* '''MADthew Strong''' (voiced by [[Cory Doran]]) - A construction worker.\n* '''Commander MADhail''' (voiced by [[Cory Doran]]) - A Russian astronaut.\n* '''Corsetta Camisole''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - She is a mistress of disguise who dresses fashionably.\n* '''Detective Data''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - A former HQ operative. The reason why she started working for MAD is because Gadget took credit for all her hard work which Chief praises him for despite Data's claims that she did the work.\n* '''Malicious''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - Penny's secret friend who attends \"Evil University.\" She enjoys medieval torture and weapons do to that they have the word \"Evil.\" Also, Malicious has a huge crush on Talon.\n* '''MAD Weed Wacko''' (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler]]) - He really hates plants so much more worst and even poison ivy.\n* '''Cheekster''' (voiced by Robert Tinkler) - The mad wrestler.\n* '''Little Old Lady''' - She first appeared in \"Gadget Management\" as part of a simulation where she said \"M.A.D. Forever\" using her cane to shoot.\n* '''Mac Macintosh''' (voiced by Scott McCord) - An evil farmer in an apple costume.\n* '''Mayor''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - An evil mayor.\n* '''MADalena''' (voiced by [[Stacey DePass]]) - A M.A.D. Agent that looks like penny. She once opened a resort near the Slopsquatch habitat.\n* '''Cuckoo Clockmaker''' (voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - A man who's obsessively tinkering with clocks and doing the job \"on Time.\" He also hates to work with Talon.\n* '''Jacques Crankcase''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - A no-good cheating racer who will stop at nothing to win.\n* '''MADtana Dan''' (voiced by Scott McCord) - A impetuous explorer and treasure hunter who steals priceless treasures for M.A.D.'s plots. Unlike the other M.A.D. Agents, MADtana Dan is never comfortable working with Talon.\n* '''MADgician''' (voiced by Ron Pardo) - A magician who was once Gadget's assistant for birthday parties. But from all the humiliation Gadget gave him, he wants him to \"disappear.\"\n* '''MADison Von Trapp''' (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) - Dr. Claw's best huntress with a metallic eagle. She is equipped with an invention called \"The Cross-Boa\" which is a crossbow with a robot snake.\n* '''Sue Donym''' (voiced by [[Denise Oliver]]) - M.A.D.'s top spy who uses an attaching truth spray.\n** '''Brawn''' - Sue Donym's shifty dog.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Baron von Steeltoe''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - A Scottish villain in metal boots who is Dr. Claw's rival.\n* '''Dr. Ithica Marvins''' (voiced by Julie Lemieux) - HQ's greatest female archaeologist. Though everytime she discovered something remarkable, she'll instantly gets captured or trapped.\n* '''Nigel Saint De' Le-peppertone IV Esquire III''' (voiced by Robert Tinkler) - International pop star whistler.

The final season was released in 2018, but is still available via reruns.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen Dr. Claw is thawed out of his iceberg prison and reactivates M.A.D., Inspector Gadget is brought out of retirement and is back on the beat to stop Dr. Claw once again, but this time, with Penny and Brain officially by his side. A new character in this series is Dr. Claw's nephew, Talon. Penny has a slight crush on him, and vice versa. The series is even more comical, cartoony and slapsticky than the original, with Dr. Claw being portrayed as much less sinister and Gadget a lot more inept and bumbling.\n\n==Characters==\n===HQ===\n* '''Inspector Gadget''' (voiced by Ivan Sherry) - Inspector Gadget is still the same powerful but unintelligent, gullible, and incompetent cyborg he was before, but now he's accompanied by Penny on his missions. As always, he's the bumbling \"hero\", only inadvertently saving the day and typically leaving a path of destruction in doing so. While he loves his niece, he still generally doesn't listen to Penny, even though she's his new assistant. Gadget is noticeably more egotistical than he was in the original series. He also has a new Gadget Mobile (since the old one turned to dust after he repeatedly jinxed its condition), which is snug and more efficient that the previous.\n* '''Penny''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) - Penny is Inspector Gadget's niece, an agent in training. She is brave, clever and willing to fight villains. She has a crush on Talon, Dr. Claw's nephew. Despite her crush, she never lets him get away with his and his uncle's evil plans. Unlike other Inspector Gadget productions, she now joins Gadget in his assignments and despite the show's title, she is effectively the protagonist. Also unlike the 80's series, she is a relatively adept fighter, only seldomly getting caught by M.A.D. agents. Penny is still typically the one who really saves the day but never gets any recognition for it, generally happy to let her uncle take all the credit for completing the mission. Penny acts like a normal teenage girl when she's not on duty. Her computer book and watch have been replaced with a holographic tablet called the codex. Her middle name is Ruth.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Inspector Gadget |title=Evil U |quote=If my middle name wasn't Ruth it would be Ruthless |author=Penny}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |series=Inspector Gadget |title=Brain Drain}} Penny: \"What's my middle name?\" Talon: \"Ruth! What? I follow you on MySpySpace.\"</ref> In International versions, she is called '''Sophie'''.\n* '''Brain''' (voiced by [[Scott McCord]]) - Brain is Penny's dog, best friend and her sidekick and he always accompanies her to every mission. As always, he is a master of disguise and usually Gadget mistakes him for a M.A.D.-Agent and tries to apprehend him (even when Brain is attempting to save him or when Penny tries to tell him it's really Brain). In International versions, he is called '''Fino'''.\n* '''Chief Quimby''' (voiced by [[Derek McGrath]]) - Chief Quimby is the leader of the HQ and always gets Gadget and Penny their missions. To manage this, he always appears at the strangest places. This time, instead of paper, his self-destructing messages are now holographic. Chief Quimby now wears glasses and a coat and his hair is blonde instead of brown. He is a lot more patient than he was in previous iterations of the show. In the International versions, he is named '''Chief Gontier'''.\n* '''Professor Von Slickstein''' (voiced by Scott McCord) - Professor Von Slickstein is an HQ scientist is portrayed as a young man, rather than a man in his late 60's in the original series. In the German version, he is named '''Professor Rotoskop'''.\n* '''Kayla''' (voiced by [[Katie Griffin]]) - Penny's best friend, another new character and a fellow agent in training. Her cheerful and positive personality is only matched by her gift for being a blabbermouth, her motor mouth is strong enough to cripple even the toughest M.A.D.-goon. In the German version, she's called '''Karla'''.\n\n===M.A.D.===\n* '''Dr. Claw''' (voiced by Martin Roach) - As always, he wants to take over the world and destroy Gadget. This time, he has help from his nephew Talon who rescued him from his iceberg prison in the first episode. As always, his face is never shown (but his torso does appear now and then). His full name is revealed to be \"Irving Thelonious Claw, Jr.\" In the German version, he's called '''Dr. (Boris) Kralle'''; in the French version, he is called '''Dr. Gang'''.\n* '''MAD Cat''' - Unlike Dr. Claw's previous MAD Cats, this one is female. She is spoiled by Dr. Claw and shares a feud with Talon.\n* '''Talon''' (voiced by Lyon Smith) - Introduced in this series, Talon is Dr. Claw's evil nephew who rescued him in the first episode. He is clever, handsome and manipulative. Talon is aware of his handsomeness and knows how to apply it. He secretly has a crush on Penny, but they cannot be together because they're enemies. In each possible situation that Talon wants to impress Penny, she mostly ignores him. Talon is one of a very small handful of M.A.D. agents who is aware that it's generally Penny, not Gadget, who foils M.A.D.'s plots. Even his uncle is oblivious to this fact. Talon is always arguing with his uncle because he considers his plans to be rather old-fashioned (although there's really nothing wrong with that) or just ridiculous, which is true. His uncle always blames him when his plans fail, even when it's not Talon's fault. There are even situations when Dr. Claw blames Talon for something his nephew has warned him of. Although he does everything to impress his uncle, he isn't treated very well by him. In the German version, he is named Titus. In the French version, he is called '''Tristan'''. In the Spanish version, he is called '''Garra'''. In the Russian version, he is called '''Claw''' in some series \n* '''Mama Claw''' (voiced by Martin Roach) - Maryland Claw is Dr. Claw's mother and Talon's grandmother. From her constant nagging, she often embarrasses her son because Dr. Claw is taking orders from someone who's not him and often tries to get Dr. Claw and Talon to improve themselves. Mama Claw appeared in a few episodes. Like Dr. Claw, her face is never seen, but the back of her head hair and ears do appear now and then.\n* '''M.A.D. Henchmen''' (Various Voices) - The generic henchmen of M.A.D.\n\n====M.A.D. Agents====\n* '''MADthew Strong''' (voiced by [[Cory Doran]]) - A construction worker.\n* '''Commander MADhail''' (voiced by [[Cory Doran]]) - A Russian astronaut.\n* '''Corsetta Camisole''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - She is a mistress of disguise who dresses fashionably.\n* '''Detective Data''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - A former HQ operative. The reason why she started working for MAD is because Gadget took credit for all her hard work which Chief praises him for despite Data's claims that she did the work.\n* '''Malicious''' (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) - Penny's secret friend who attends \"Evil University.\" She enjoys medieval torture and weapons do to that they have the word \"Evil.\" Also, Malicious has a huge crush on Talon.\n* '''MAD Weed Wacko''' (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler]]) - He really hates plants so much more worst and even poison ivy.\n* '''Cheekster''' (voiced by Robert Tinkler) - The mad wrestler.\n* '''Little Old Lady''' - She first appeared in \"Gadget Management\" as part of a simulation where she said \"M.A.D. Forever\" using her cane to shoot.\n* '''Mac Macintosh''' (voiced by Scott McCord) - An evil farmer in an apple costume.\n* '''Mayor''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - An evil mayor.\n* '''MADalena''' (voiced by [[Stacey DePass]]) - A M.A.D. Agent that looks like penny. She once opened a resort near the Slopsquatch habitat.\n* '''Cuckoo Clockmaker''' (voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - A man who's obsessively tinkering with clocks and doing the job \"on Time.\" He also hates to work with Talon.\n* '''Jacques Crankcase''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - A no-good cheating racer who will stop at nothing to win.\n* '''MADtana Dan''' (voiced by Scott McCord) - A impetuous explorer and treasure hunter who steals priceless treasures for M.A.D.'s plots. Unlike the other M.A.D. Agents, MADtana Dan is never comfortable working with Talon.\n* '''MADgician''' (voiced by Ron Pardo) - A magician who was once Gadget's assistant for birthday parties. But from all the humiliation Gadget gave him, he wants him to \"disappear.\"\n* '''MADison Von Trapp''' (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) - Dr. Claw's best huntress with a metallic eagle. She is equipped with an invention called \"The Cross-Boa\" which is a crossbow with a robot snake.\n* '''Sue Donym''' (voiced by [[Denise Oliver]]) - M.A.D.'s top spy who uses an attaching truth spray.\n** '''Brawn''' - Sue Donym's shifty dog.\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Baron von Steeltoe''' (voiced by Cory Doran) - A Scottish villain in metal boots who is Dr. Claw's rival.\n* '''Dr. Ithica Marvins''' (voiced by Julie Lemieux) - HQ's greatest female archaeologist. Though everytime she discovered something remarkable, she'll instantly gets captured or trapped.\n* '''Nigel Saint De' Le-peppertone IV Esquire III''' (voiced by Robert Tinkler) - International pop star whistler.

As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

Varnam|title=Milk and Milk Products: Technology, chemistry and microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYnkBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA58|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4615-1813-6|pages=58\u201362}}</ref>\n\n* Flash heating\n* Flash cooling\n* Homogenization\n* Aseptic packaging\n\nIn the heating stage, the treated liquid is first pre-heated to a noncritical temperature ({{cvt|70|\u2013|80|C|disp=sqbr}} for milk), and then quickly heated to the temperature required by the process. There are two types of heating technologies: ''direct'', where the product is put in a direct contact with the hot steam, and ''indirect'', where the product and the heating medium remain separated by the equipment's contact surfaces. The main goals of the design, both from product quality and from efficiency standpoints, are to maintain the high product temperature for the shortest period possible, and to ensure that the temperature is evenly distributed throughout.<ref name=\"Varnam2012\"/><ref name=Duizer>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/uht-methods |title= The Dairy Science and Technology eBook |publisher=University of Guelph, Food Science |chapter=UHT Methods |last=Duizer |first=Lisa}}</ref>\n\n===Direct heating systems===\nDirect systems have the advantage that the product is held at a high temperature for a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the thermal damage for the sensitive products such as milk. There are two groups of direct systems:<ref name=Duizer/>\n* Injection-based, where the high-pressure steam is injected into the liquid. It allows fast heating and cooling, but is only suitable for some products. As the product comes in contact with the hot nozzle, there is a possibility of local overheating.\n* Infusion-based, where the liquid is pumped through a [[nozzle]] into a chamber with high-pressure steam at a relatively low concentration, providing a large surface contact area. This method achieves near-instantaneous heating and cooling and even distribution of temperature, avoiding local overheating. It is suitable for liquids of both low and high [[viscosity]].\n\n===Indirect heating systems===\nIn indirect systems, the product is heated by a solid [[heat exchanger]] similar to those used for pasteurization. However, as higher temperatures are applied, it is necessary to employ higher pressures in order to prevent boiling.<ref name=Varnam2012/> There are three types of exchangers in use:<ref name=Duizer/>\n* Plate exchangers, \n* Tubular exchangers\n* Scraped-surface exchangers.\nFor higher efficiency, pressurized water or steam is used as the medium for heating the exchangers themselves, accompanied with a regeneration unit which allows reuse of the medium and energy saving.<ref name=Varnam2012/>\n\n===Flash cooling===\nAfter heating, the hot product is passed to a holding tube and then to a [[vacuum chamber]], where it suddenly loses the temperature and vaporizes. The process, referred to as ''flash cooling'', reduces the risk of thermal damage, removes some or all of the excess water obtained through the contact with steam, and removes some of the volatile compounds which negatively affect the product quality. Cooling rate and the quantity of water removed is determined by the level of vacuum, which must be carefully calibrated.<ref name=Varnam2012/>\n\n===Homogenization===\n{{main|Homogenization (chemistry)}}\nHomogenization is part of the process specifically for milk. Homogenization is a mechanical treatment which results in a reduction of the size, and an increase in the number and total surface area, of fat globules in the milk. This reduces milk's tendency to form cream at the surface, and on contact with containers enhances its stability and makes it more palatable for consumers.<ref name=Duizer2>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/introduction-1 |title= The Dairy Science and Technology eBook |publisher=University of Guelph, Food Science |chapter= Homogenization of Milk and Milk Products |last=Duizer |first=Lisa}}</ref>\n\n==Worldwide use==\n\nUHT milk has seen large success in much of Europe, where across the continent 7 out of 10 people drink it regularly.<ref name=\"cons\">Solomon.

There are two types of heating technologies: ''direct'', where the product is put in a direct contact with the hot steam, and ''indirect'', where the product and the heating medium remain separated by the equipment's contact surfaces. The main goals of the design, both from product quality and from efficiency standpoints, are to maintain the high product temperature for the shortest period possible, and to ensure that the temperature is evenly distributed throughout.<ref name=\"Varnam2012\"/><ref name=Duizer>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/uht-methods |title= The Dairy Science and Technology eBook |publisher=University of Guelph, Food Science |chapter=UHT Methods |last=Duizer |first=Lisa}}</ref>\n\n===Direct heating systems===\nDirect systems have the advantage that the product is held at a high temperature for a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the thermal damage for the sensitive products such as milk. There are two groups of direct systems:<ref name=Duizer/>\n* Injection-based, where the high-pressure steam is injected into the liquid. It allows fast heating and cooling, but is only suitable for some products. As the product comes in contact with the hot nozzle, there is a possibility of local overheating.\n* Infusion-based, where the liquid is pumped through a [[nozzle]] into a chamber with high-pressure steam at a relatively low concentration, providing a large surface contact area. This method achieves near-instantaneous heating and cooling and even distribution of temperature, avoiding local overheating. It is suitable for liquids of both low and high [[viscosity]].\n\n===Indirect heating systems===\nIn indirect systems, the product is heated by a solid [[heat exchanger]] similar to those used for pasteurization. However, as higher temperatures are applied, it is necessary to employ higher pressures in order to prevent boiling.<ref name=Varnam2012/> There are three types of exchangers in use:<ref name=Duizer/>\n* Plate exchangers, \n* Tubular exchangers\n* Scraped-surface exchangers.\nFor higher efficiency, pressurized water or steam is used as the medium for heating the exchangers themselves, accompanied with a regeneration unit which allows reuse of the medium and energy saving.<ref name=Varnam2012/>\n\n===Flash cooling===\nAfter heating, the hot product is passed to a holding tube and then to a [[vacuum chamber]], where it suddenly loses the temperature and vaporizes. The process, referred to as ''flash cooling'', reduces the risk of thermal damage, removes some or all of the excess water obtained through the contact with steam, and removes some of the volatile compounds which negatively affect the product quality. Cooling rate and the quantity of water removed is determined by the level of vacuum, which must be carefully calibrated.<ref name=Varnam2012/>\n\n===Homogenization===\n{{main|Homogenization (chemistry)}}\nHomogenization is part of the process specifically for milk. Homogenization is a mechanical treatment which results in a reduction of the size, and an increase in the number and total surface area, of fat globules in the milk. This reduces milk's tendency to form cream at the surface, and on contact with containers enhances its stability and makes it more palatable for consumers.<ref name=Duizer2>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/introduction-1 |title= The Dairy Science and Technology eBook |publisher=University of Guelph, Food Science |chapter= Homogenization of Milk and Milk Products |last=Duizer |first=Lisa}}</ref>\n\n==Worldwide use==\n\nUHT milk has seen large success in much of Europe, where across the continent 7 out of 10 people drink it regularly.<ref name=\"cons\">Solomon.

Before her fame, Carver also worked behind-the-scenes as a beautician and make-up artist for a large French cosmetic company. Eventually, Carver met an experienced photographer who encouraged her to become a model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jordancarver.com/aboutme.html |title=AboutMe |publisher=Jordancarver.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> She agreed, and by the late 2000s, Carver moved to the United States to pursue modelling jobs, settling in [[Los Angeles]], California.\n\n==Career==\nIn January 2010, Carver launched her modelling career with her own website featuring glamour photos, videos and other content. In addition to her own exclusive content, Carver began posing for magazine publications in 2011. Carver became successful owing to an appealing general aesthetic, which included proportionately enlarged breasts. In February, Carver posed for British men's magazine, ''[[Zoo Weekly]]''. In June 2011, Carver posed nude for the Italian fetish magazine, ''Alula'' (http://www.efedizioni.com/magazine.html). At the same time, Carver was receiving media publicity in her native Germany.\n\nCarver was featured in the German ''[[Bild]]'' magazine, which proclaimed her as \"Yoga-Jordan\", due to her yoga workouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/lifestyle/wellness-fitness/fitness/yoga-jordan-macht-die-maenner-verrueckt-20900706.bild.html |title=Yoga-Jordan macht alle M\u00e4nner verr\u00fcckt - Wellness & Fitness |language=de |publisher=Bild.de |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> In January 2012, Carver was featured in the American tabloid and entertainment television show [[TMZ on TV|''TMZ'']].

From July to August 2013, Carver participated on the German reality show ''Wild Girls \u2013 Auf High Heels durch Afrika'' (Wild Girls - In High Heels Through Africa), in which she along with other participants lived in the deserts of [[Namibia]] with the indigenous people.

In the second half of the 20th century, this parent store was developed into a chain of department stores across England and Wales. By the turn of the millennium, the flagship store in Croydon was the third-largest department store in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/department-stores/allders-collapses-into-administration/5037641.article |title=Allders collapses into administration |first=Nicola |last=Harrison |newspaper=Retail Week |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2016 }}{{subscription}}</ref> The chain was broken up and sold after it went into administration in 2005, although the Croydon store continued trading until 2012, having been purchased by [[Harold Tillman]], the then-owner of the [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] clothing company. On 17 January 2013, the company closed the store along with the website, and the brand ceased to exist.\n\n==Joshua Allder==\nAllders was opened in 1862 at 102 and 103 [[North End, Croydon]], as a \"linen draper and silk mercer\" by Joshua Allder (1838\u20131904) from [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], who had served his apprenticeship in Croydon. His shop was diverse, with special offers on silk dresses and also a morning dress section, and departments offering lower-cost items such as buttons and ribbons. This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\">{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419215209/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=The Story of a Store |author=Kerry McQueeney |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian }}</ref>\n\nCroydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. In 1870, the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> although he had to wait for some 20 years to acquire 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the [[Local Board of Health]], on the council of the [[County Borough of Croydon]]<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> for nine years, and in the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Allder died in 1904 leaving a store which had expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, among other items.\n\nHis main residence in Pampisford Road, [[South Croydon]], now houses Regina Coeli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby are named Allder Way and Joshua Close.\n\n==Growth==\nIn 1908 Allder's family sold the business to J. W. Holdron and F. C. Bearman, owners of stores in [[Peckham]] and [[Leytonstone]] respectively. They developed the store into 50 departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/>\n\nIn 1926, the famous North End facade was erected, uniting the frontage of the Croydon premises for the first time. In 1932 an Arcade from North End to George Street was completed,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> proving a  very popular addition to the store. An extension to the restaurant was opened in the same year.\n\nThe building suffered considerable damage in [[World War II]] but never closed. Improvements during the 1950s included the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and the installation of Croydon's first escalators, built by [[J & E Hall]],  in 1954.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> By 1958, the Lawrence family was forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of Daniel Arthur Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack & Bernard Lyons' [[United Drapery Stores]] (UDS), owners of [[Richard Shops]], [[John Collier (retailer)|John Collier]], Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of D. A. Lawrence, S. John Lawrence, was kept on by UDS as Managing Director. Allders continued to expand, reaching \u00a31 million turnover in 1958 and \u00a33 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role.\n\nIn the 1960s there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the [[Whitgift Centre]] to the north of Allders, into which the store expanded, and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes led to greater competition with the [[West End of London|West End]] and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976 Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m\u00b2) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and became the third-largest department store in the UK, after [[Harrods]] and [[Selfridges]]. It had the largest carpet department in Europe, amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre.\n\nAllders' immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed [[Debenhams]] in 1973, along with many other Debenhams stores. To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed Allders.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> This process began with Shinners of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in 1979 and later Hinds of [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], Medhursts of [[Bromley]], James Page of [[Camberley]], Mackross of Cardiff, Willis Ludlow of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in [[Portsmouth]]. Only [[Arding and Hobbs]] at [[Clapham Junction]] in London and the furnishing store of Clover at [[Kirkstall]] in [[Leeds]] retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream-coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group, together with the phrase \"All that a great store should be\".\n\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|Allders in 1983]]\nIn 1983 the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to [[Hanson plc]] and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]] appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. Allders expanded with new stores opening in [[Basildon]] and [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and in many international airports as [[duty-free]] concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background.\n\nIn 1989 a [[management buyout]] saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of the store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the ground floor. A new Allders store of {{convert|137000|sqft|m2}} opened at [[Woking]] in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993.\n\nThe growth of the group rapidly accelerated following stock market flotation with the acquisition of existing stores and the building of new ones. This began with the acquisition of [[Nottingham]] Co-op's lease on their Broad Marsh Centre store and the development of a chain of stand-alone home furnishing stores. The opening of a second Clover store at [[Rotherham]] was succeeded by the development of \"At Home with Allders\" a concept for new stores in out-of-town [[retail park]]s, the first of which opened at [[Aylesford]] in [[Kent]] in 1994. The Clover stores were both rebranded.\n\nIn September 1996 Allders purchased a number of department stores from the [[Owen Owen]] group that traded under the [[Lewis's]] and Owen Owen names. This included branches in [[Basingstoke]], [[Coventry]], [[Ilford]], [[Leeds]], [[Oxford]], [[Redditch]] and [[Slough]].\n\nIn 1997 Allders acquired the bankrupt [[Maple & Co.|Maples]] furniture brand and seven of its retail outlets. These stores were integrated into the Allders At Home portfolio and brought the brand to town centre locations in [[Bromley]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Crawley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Watford]]. The Bromley outlet, in direct competition with the town's main Allders store, was soon disposed of. The Kingston store, offering a range focussed solely on furniture, beds and carpets, struggled to compete with [[Bentalls]] and [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]. This competition in the town and the frontage of the store being obscured for some time whilst work on the Kingston Bridge was carried out led to the store's closure within two years. A second Kingston store was later opened in the former [[C & A]] building, offering a broader range of merchandise for the home.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:CroydonNorthEnd.jpg|thumb|North End and Allders in 2005]]\nShares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group. Nevertheless, it continued a policy of expansion, acquiring the premises of the former C & A stores at [[Guildford]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Leicester]] and [[York]] in 2000 and later the large C & A building on the south side of [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. The \"At Home with Allders\" trading name was replaced with \"Allders At Home\" on conversion of a number of the C&A stores to an expanded home format. Problems continued, however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], on the store's site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite the Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]]. In late 2002 Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail, named after Terry Green's daughter, that bid for Allders, with [[Lehman Brothers]] investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of [[Debenhams]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]].\n\nSome felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' site for its Park Place project, in order to sell the plot to another retailer, probably John Lewis. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early 2003 for about \u00a3162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. It was claimed that some of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products, though this was denied by Terry Green.<ref name=\"rankine\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2904441/Allders-chiefs-strategy-was-completely-wrong.html|title=Allders chief's strategy was 'completely wrong'|author=Kate Rankine|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Administration, 2004\u20135==\nIn September 2004, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of \u00a322.6m for the year to 30 June 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm Allders store chain up for sale] BBC News, 8 December 2004</ref> blaming the speed of the transformation of the business. In December 2004, it announced the business was up for sale. There was some early interest that [[Primark]] was to purchase some of the stores<ref>[http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/news/allders.htm Allders news] My Fashion United</ref> but no interest was found in taking on the company as a whole and it was placed in administration on 26 January 2005. It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of \u00a315 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers. An under-construction store at the [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] was never opened and was split into stores for [[Next (clothing)|Next]] and Primark when the centre opened in October 2005.\n\n[[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]], the administrators, searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 50 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as [[House of Fraser]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]], [[Debenhams]] and [[Primark]] said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on 5 February and had started to close from March 2005: all had closed by May 2005 with the Leeds store being the last to close down on 22 May 2005, with the exception of Croydon.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4570725.stm Allders store closing its doors] BBC News, 22 May 2005</ref>\n\n==Croydon store, 2005\u20132013==\nIn May 2005 it was announced that the owners of [[Jaeger (clothing retailer)|Jaeger]] would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director, Andrew MacKenzie, turned the fortunes of the company around and projected a \u00a31 million gross profit. Significant investment was made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience. It was the only Allders store to survive the 2005 administration.\n\nIn April 2006 it was announced that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.742239.0.allders_safe_for_two_years.php |title=Allders safe for two years |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=24 July 2006 }}</ref> The land and store that Allders leased had regular break clauses to the benefit of the \"virtual freehold leaseholder\" held by [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]] subsidiary companies for 250 years. The freehold interest was held by the [[Whitgift Foundation]].

This diversity showed a shrewdness in business and an understanding of his mostly female customers.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\">{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419215209/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/heritage/557240.the_story_of_a_store/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=The Story of a Store |author=Kerry McQueeney |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |newspaper=Croydon Guardian }}</ref>\n\nCroydon was a growing town, and Allder's business grew with it. In 1870, the shop expanded into 104, 106 and 107 North End,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> although he had to wait for some 20 years to acquire 105, a bakery. The wealth Allder made allowed him to play a prominent part in the local community, on the [[Local Board of Health]], on the council of the [[County Borough of Croydon]]<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> for nine years, and in the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|non-conformist]] church community. He supported greater rights for his workers, being instrumental in getting local stores closed for a half-day on Wednesdays. Allder died in 1904 leaving a store which had expanded beyond clothing and haberdashery to sell glass and porcelain, among other items.\n\nHis main residence in Pampisford Road, [[South Croydon]], now houses Regina Coeli RC school, and two cul-de-sacs nearby are named Allder Way and Joshua Close.\n\n==Growth==\nIn 1908 Allder's family sold the business to J. W. Holdron and F. C. Bearman, owners of stores in [[Peckham]] and [[Leytonstone]] respectively. They developed the store into 50 departments with 500 staff and owned the business until 1921. It then passed to the Lawrence family, under whose control it became a limited company.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> \n\nIn 1926, the famous North End facade was erected, uniting the frontage of the Croydon premises for the first time. In 1932 an Arcade from North End to George Street was completed,<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> proving a  very popular addition to the store. An extension to the restaurant was opened in the same year.\n\nThe building suffered considerable damage in [[World War II]] but never closed. Improvements during the 1950s included the takeover of a cinema auditorium as the gift department and the installation of Croydon's first escalators, built by [[J & E Hall]],  in 1954.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> By 1958, the Lawrence family was forced to sell as a result of death duties incurred after the death of Daniel Arthur Lawrence, managing director. The store was acquired by Jack & Bernard Lyons' [[United Drapery Stores]] (UDS), owners of [[Richard Shops]], [[John Collier (retailer)|John Collier]], Alexandre Tailors and several department stores. The son of D. A. Lawrence, S. John Lawrence, was kept on by UDS as Managing Director. Allders continued to expand, reaching \u00a31 million turnover in 1958 and \u00a33 million by 1963. Fashion's importance declined, with household items taking a greater role.\n\nIn the 1960s there was considerable change in Croydon, particularly the construction of the [[Whitgift Centre]] to the north of Allders, into which the store expanded, and the creation of the St George's Walk development. Transport and lifestyle changes led to greater competition with the [[West End of London|West End]] and further improvements were required to modernise the store. The section fronting George Street was rebuilt and expanded, retaining a Victorian facade, alongside a new addition. Rebuilding works continued into Dingwall Avenue and by 1976 Allders had 1,700 staff and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m\u00b2) of floor space. It was a Croydon landmark and became the third-largest department store in the UK, after [[Harrods]] and [[Selfridges]]. It had the largest carpet department in Europe, amongst other claims. Croydon was by this time a major retail centre.\n\nAllders' immediate competitor, Kennards, was renamed [[Debenhams]] in 1973, along with many other Debenhams stores. To compete with the central buying and advertising of Debenhams and other larger groups, the department stores owned by UDS were all gradually renamed Allders.<ref name=\"mcqueeney\"/> This process began with Shinners of [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] in 1979 and later Hinds of [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], Medhursts of [[Bromley]], James Page of [[Camberley]], Mackross of Cardiff, Willis Ludlow of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and Landport Drapery Bazaar (LDB) in [[Portsmouth]]. Only [[Arding and Hobbs]] at [[Clapham Junction]] in London and the furnishing store of Clover at [[Kirkstall]] in [[Leeds]] retained their original identities. A new geometric logo of ten orange 'A's arranged in a circle on brown and cream-coloured stationery, bags and carpets appeared across the group, together with the phrase \"All that a great store should be\".\n\n[[File:North End, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 625263.jpg|thumb|Allders in 1983]]\nIn 1983 the Lyons family sold the UDS Group to [[Hanson plc]] and Allders became a flagship company of the group, with [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]] appearing on Allders' roof in TV adverts. Allders expanded with new stores opening in [[Basildon]] and [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]] and in many international airports as [[duty-free]] concessions. A new 'Fourth Floor' was built on the roof of the Croydon store to house a new Audio and Television Department and two new restaurants as well as a link into the staff areas of London House on Dingwall Avenue. The group's brown, cream and orange livery was replaced with a scheme of light blue and gold lettering on a dark blue background.\n\nIn 1989 a [[management buyout]] saw the international arm spun off as a separate company. There was continued upheaval in Croydon with the complete refurbishment of the Whitgift Centre and of parts of the store. The vast carpet department was contracted to a secondary location allowing for the creation of a new perfumery and cosmetics hall at the centre of the ground floor. A new Allders store of {{convert|137000|sqft|m2}} opened at [[Woking]] in 1992. Allders plc was floated on the stock market in 1993.\n\nThe growth of the group rapidly accelerated following stock market flotation with the acquisition of existing stores and the building of new ones. This began with the acquisition of [[Nottingham]] Co-op's lease on their Broad Marsh Centre store and the development of a chain of stand-alone home furnishing stores. The opening of a second Clover store at [[Rotherham]] was succeeded by the development of \"At Home with Allders\" a concept for new stores in out-of-town [[retail park]]s, the first of which opened at [[Aylesford]] in [[Kent]] in 1994. The Clover stores were both rebranded.\n\nIn September 1996 Allders purchased a number of department stores from the [[Owen Owen]] group that traded under the [[Lewis's]] and Owen Owen names. This included branches in [[Basingstoke]], [[Coventry]], [[Ilford]], [[Leeds]], [[Oxford]], [[Redditch]] and [[Slough]].\n\nIn 1997 Allders acquired the bankrupt [[Maple & Co.|Maples]] furniture brand and seven of its retail outlets. These stores were integrated into the Allders At Home portfolio and brought the brand to town centre locations in [[Bromley]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Crawley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Watford]]. The Bromley outlet, in direct competition with the town's main Allders store, was soon disposed of. The Kingston store, offering a range focussed solely on furniture, beds and carpets, struggled to compete with [[Bentalls]] and [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]. This competition in the town and the frontage of the store being obscured for some time whilst work on the Kingston Bridge was carried out led to the store's closure within two years. A second Kingston store was later opened in the former [[C & A]] building, offering a broader range of merchandise for the home.\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:CroydonNorthEnd.jpg|thumb|North End and Allders in 2005]]\nShares in Allders crashed in 1998 after disappointing sales and difficulties integrating the Maples furniture group. Nevertheless, it continued a policy of expansion, acquiring the premises of the former C & A stores at [[Guildford]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Leicester]] and [[York]] in 2000 and later the large C & A building on the south side of [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. The \"At Home with Allders\" trading name was replaced with \"Allders At Home\" on conversion of a number of the C&A stores to an expanded home format. Problems continued, however. In Croydon, there were plans to build a new shopping centre, [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]], on the store's site and much of the area to the south. A new Allders would be built opposite the Town Hall. Croydon Council's partner in this plan was developer [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]]. In late 2002 Minerva was part of a new group called Scarlett Retail, named after Terry Green's daughter, that bid for Allders, with [[Lehman Brothers]] investment bank and a management team including Terry Green, the former chief executive of [[Debenhams]] and [[British Home Stores|BHS]].\n\nSome felt at the time that Scarlett's bid was based on Minerva's intention to acquire Allders' site for its Park Place project, in order to sell the plot to another retailer, probably John Lewis. The bid was felt by many to be overpriced. Nevertheless, Scarlett paid Tom Hunter an improved price and they landed the company in early 2003 for about \u00a3162m ($316m). Green became chief executive and set about an overhaul of Allders' image. It was claimed that some of the traditional homeware, haberdashery and clothing for middle-aged, middle-income women was reduced, with a new emphasis on young fashion and beauty products, though this was denied by Terry Green.<ref name=\"rankine\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2904441/Allders-chiefs-strategy-was-completely-wrong.html|title=Allders chief's strategy was 'completely wrong'|author=Kate Rankine|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n==Administration, 2004\u20135==\nIn September 2004, Minerva announced that Allders had made a loss of \u00a322.6m for the year to 30 June 2004,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4077705.stm Allders store chain up for sale] BBC News, 8 December 2004</ref> blaming the speed of the transformation of the business. In December 2004, it announced the business was up for sale. There was some early interest that [[Primark]] was to purchase some of the stores<ref>[http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/news/allders.htm Allders news] My Fashion United</ref> but no interest was found in taking on the company as a whole and it was placed in administration on 26 January 2005. It was revealed that there was a pensions deficit of \u00a315 million. 130 of the staff at the Croydon headquarters were laid off, including Green and other senior managers. An under-construction store at the [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre]] in [[Plymouth]] was never opened and was split into stores for [[Next (clothing)|Next]] and Primark when the centre opened in October 2005.\n\n[[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]], the administrators, searched for buyers for the chain or individual stores. Of Allders' 50 stores, only 35 received offers, with rival retailers such as [[House of Fraser]], [[British Home Stores|BHS]], [[Debenhams]] and [[Primark]] said to have expressed an interest. The ten remaining stores, including the Oxford Street branch, began closing-down sales on 5 February and had started to close from March 2005: all had closed by May 2005 with the Leeds store being the last to close down on 22 May 2005, with the exception of Croydon.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/4570725.stm Allders store closing its doors] BBC News, 22 May 2005</ref>\n\n==Croydon store, 2005\u20132013==\nIn May 2005 it was announced that the owners of [[Jaeger (clothing retailer)|Jaeger]] would take on the flagship Croydon store and that it would continue to trade as Allders. In the first year of operation the new Managing Director, Andrew MacKenzie, turned the fortunes of the company around and projected a \u00a31 million gross profit. Significant investment was made to attract back to the store its Croydon audience. It was the only Allders store to survive the 2005 administration.\n\nIn April 2006 it was announced that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/search/display.var.742239.0.allders_safe_for_two_years.php |title=Allders safe for two years |newspaper=Croydon Guardian |date=26 April 2006 |accessdate=24 July 2006 }}</ref> The land and store that Allders leased had regular break clauses to the benefit of the \"virtual freehold leaseholder\" held by [[Minerva (property firm)|Minerva plc]] subsidiary companies for 250 years.

It is an ''audava'' r\u0101gam (meaning pentatonic scale) in which only five of the seven ''[[swara]]s'' (musical notes)are used. It is a ''[[janya]]'' r\u0101gam (derived scale), fairly popular in Carnatic music. There is a belief that ''Amr\u0325tavar\u1e63i\u1e47i'' causes rain, and that the Carnatic composer Muthuswami Dikshitar brought rain at [[Ettayapuram]], Tamil Nadu, India by singing his composition, ''Aanandaamrutakarshini amrutavarshini''.<ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S.

Its ''{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a-avaroha\u1e47a}}'' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see [[Swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for details on below notation and terms):\n\n*[[Arohana|{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S|G3|M2|P|N3|S'|foot=yes}}\n*[[Avarohana|{{IAST|avaroha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S'|N3|P|M2|G3|S|foot=yes}}\n\nThe notes used in this scale are ''shadjam, antara gandharam, prati madhyamam, panchamam'' and ''kakali nish\u0101dam'')\n\n''Amr\u0325tavar\u1e63i\u1e47i '' is considered a ''janya'' r\u0101gam of ''[[Chitrambari]]'', the 66th ''[[Melakarta]]'' r\u0101gam, although it can be derived from other melakarta r\u0101gams, such as ''[[Mechakalyani|Kalyani]]'', ''[[Gamanashrama]]'' or ''[[Vishwambari]]'', by dropping both ''rishabham'' and ''dhaivatam''.

It is an ''audava'' r\u0101gam (meaning pentatonic scale) in which only five of the seven ''[[swara]]s'' (musical notes)are used. It is a ''[[janya]]'' r\u0101gam (derived scale), fairly popular in Carnatic music. There is a belief that ''Amr\u0325tavar\u1e63i\u1e47i'' causes rain, and that the Carnatic composer Muthuswami Dikshitar brought rain at [[Ettayapuram]], Tamil Nadu, India by singing his composition, ''Aanandaamrutakarshini amrutavarshini''.<ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref><ref name=\"raganidhi\">''R\u0101ganidhi'' by P.

It is a symmetric pentatonic scale (''audava-audava'' ragam<ref name=\"ragas\" /><ref name=\"raganidhi\" /> in Carnatic music classification). Its ''{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a-avaroha\u1e47a}}'' structure (ascending and descending scale) is as follows (see [[Swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for details on below notation and terms):\n\n*[[Arohana|{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S|G3|M2|P|N3|S'|foot=yes}}\n*[[Avarohana|{{IAST|avaroha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S'|N3|P|M2|G3|S|foot=yes}}\n\nThe notes used in this scale are ''shadjam, antara gandharam, prati madhyamam, panchamam'' and ''kakali nish\u0101dam'')\n\n''Amr\u0325tavar\u1e63i\u1e47i '' is considered a ''janya'' r\u0101gam of ''[[Chitrambari]]'', the 66th ''[[Melakarta]]'' r\u0101gam, although it can be derived from other melakarta r\u0101gams, such as ''[[Mechakalyani|Kalyani]]'', ''[[Gamanashrama]]'' or ''[[Vishwambari]]'', by dropping both ''rishabham'' and ''dhaivatam''. There is another scale that has the same name but is less practiced in current performances. This scale is associated with the 39th melakarta [[Jhalavarali]].<ref name=\"ragas\" /><ref name=\"raganidhi\" />\n\n[[File:Amritavarshini.wav|thumb|Arohanam and Arohanam for Amritavarshini with tambura]]\n\n==Popular compositions==\n''Amr\u0325tavar\u1e63i\u1e47i'' r\u0101gam lends itself for extensive elaboration and exploration due to the symmetric and pentatonic scale.
