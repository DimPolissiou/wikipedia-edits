The stress of misfolded and damaged proteins influences neuronal function and lifespan at the level of the organism. Consequently, these studies provide a molecular basis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases including [[Huntington's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], ALS, and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. His laboratory has published over 250 papers and three monographs including two books on the Heat Shock Response and Molecular Chaperones from Cold Spring Harbor Press. During that period he received two MERIT awards from the [[National Institutes of Health]] and has been supported by the grants from the National Institutes for General Medical Science, National Institutes of Aging, National Institutes for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, [[American Cancer Society]], [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]], the Hereditary Disease Foundation, and the ALS Association. In addition to giving frequent talks at universities and scientific symposia throughout the world, he has been a Visiting Professor at the [[Technion University]] in Israel, [[Osaka University]], [[Kyoto University]], [[Kyoto Sangyo University]], [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome]], [[Beijing University]], [[\u00c5bo Akademi University]] in Finland, and [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris.  He is a founder of [[Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc.]] in Cambridge, MA, a biotech company that is discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics designed to control the body\u2019s protein homeostasis. These novel therapies are designed to treat multiple degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, cancer, and type II diabetes.\n\n==Science

The video description jokes that when a post doc in the lab told them to smile, the ''C. elegans'', lacking faces as individuals, formed the smiley face as a group, suggesting that they are intelligent, have ears, and can work in groups. In reality, the footage is  playing in reverse: the ''C. elegans'' were placed into that formation on the plate by a human and then crawled away. By reversing the footage, it looks like the ''C. elegans'' spontaneously form a smiley face. The video manipulation is hinted at in the description that reminds the viewers that the YFP is brighter in the individuals' head than their tails.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/morimoto/ Morimoto Lab Website]\n*[http://www.ibis.northwestern.edu/faculty/morimoto.html Morimoto Research Summary]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morimoto, Richard}}\n[[Category:American molecular biologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American biologists]]\n[[Category:University of Illinois at Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:Northwestern University faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Osaka University faculty]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago]]\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques]]\n[[Category:Harvard University staff]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n|name              = Richard I.

The stress of misfolded and damaged proteins influences neuronal function and lifespan at the level of the organism. Consequently, these studies provide a molecular basis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases including [[Huntington's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], ALS, and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. His laboratory has published over 250 papers and three monographs including two books on the Heat Shock Response and Molecular Chaperones from Cold Spring Harbor Press. During that period he received two MERIT awards from the [[National Institutes of Health]] and has been supported by the grants from the National Institutes for General Medical Science, National Institutes of Aging, National Institutes for Neurological Diseases and Stroke, [[American Cancer Society]], [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]], the Hereditary Disease Foundation, and the ALS Association. In addition to giving frequent talks at universities and scientific symposia throughout the world, he has been a Visiting Professor at the [[Technion University]] in Israel, [[Osaka University]], [[Kyoto University]], [[Kyoto Sangyo University]], [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome]], [[Beijing University]], [[\u00c5bo Akademi University]] in Finland, and [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in Paris.  He is a founder of [[Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc.]] in Cambridge, MA, a biotech company that is discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics designed to control the body\u2019s protein homeostasis. These novel therapies are designed to treat multiple degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, cancer, and type II diabetes.\n\n==Science

The video description jokes that when a post doc in the lab told them to smile, the ''C. elegans'', lacking faces as individuals, formed the smiley face as a group, suggesting that they are intelligent, have ears, and can work in groups. In reality, the footage is  playing in reverse: the ''C. elegans'' were placed into that formation on the plate by a human and then crawled away. By reversing the footage, it looks like the ''C. elegans'' spontaneously form a smiley face. The video manipulation is hinted at in the description that reminds the viewers that the YFP is brighter in the individuals' head than their tails.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/morimoto/ Morimoto Lab Website]\n*[http://www.ibis.northwestern.edu/faculty/morimoto.html Morimoto Research Summary]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Morimoto, Richard}}\n[[Category:American molecular biologists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American biologists]]\n[[Category:University of Illinois at Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago alumni]]\n[[Category:Northwestern University faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Osaka University faculty]]\n[[Category:People from Chicago]]\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques]]\n[[Category:Harvard University staff]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSignificant papers:Journal cites:, templated 5 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_I._Morimoto"}

Bolt objected to this apparent change in Pascoe's heritage following the success of ''[[Dark Emu (book)|Dark Emu]]'', a book written by Pascoe in 2014 that reexamines colonial accounts of [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal people in Australia]], and cites evidence of pre-colonial [[agriculture]], [[engineering]] and [[building construction]] by Aboriginal and [[Torres Strait Islander]].

Bolt repeatedly used the phrase \u201chit on\u201d to describe the sexual grooming of a year 9 school boy by his athletics coach at [[St Kevin's College, Melbourne]].   \nChild welfare advocate Dr Katrina Lines said \u201cThere is no consensual social situation in which it would be OK for an adult to \u2018hit on\u2019 a child.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 \u2013 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the [[Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act]] (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the [[Child Nutrition Act]] of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\"  Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18755322 |title=Statewide assessment of local wellness policies in Pennsylvania public school districts. |author1=Probart C |author2=McDonnell E |author3=Weirich JE |author4=Schilling L |author5=Fekete V. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.jada.2008.06.429 |volume=108 |issue=9 |journal=J Am Diet Assoc |pages=1497\u2013502}}</ref>\n\nThe legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the local wellness policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asppears.ed.state.pa.us/forms/files/PDE181.pdf  |title=Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education \u2013 Division of Food and Nutrition |date=July 2008}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\n\nThe district offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and migrant youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.<ref>USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012</ref> The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].<ref>Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009</ref> The district also offers a summer lunch program.\n\nIn 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools.

In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were $3.07 per meal for students who were income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualified for a reduced price.

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Gettysburg Area School District. In these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. This is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter, and the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the district's schools. The 2012 tuition rate was $11,168.47 for Gettysburg Area High School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=514&objID=509670&mode=2 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education  |title=Pennsylvania Public School District Tuition Rates |date=May 2012}}</ref> The administration reported that just 35 students district-wide had chosen to attend the state's cyber charter schools, rather than Gettysburg Area schools.\n\n==Grants==\n\n===Classrooms for the Future grant===\nThe Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funds to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, science, history, and mathematics) and paid for mandatory teacher training to optimize the computers' use in the classroom.

The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 \u2013 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the [[Richard B.

According to the requirements for the local wellness policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asppears.ed.state.pa.us/forms/files/PDE181.pdf  |title=Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education \u2013 Division of Food and Nutrition |date=July 2008}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.\n\nThe district offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast.

The mandate expanded in subsequent years to focus on addressing issues related to racism, and religious discrimination in Canadian society. Their primary focus was on providing school programs to educate students on issues related to bullying, bias and discrimination. The CCCJ changed its name in 2008 to the Canadian Centre for Diversity to be more reflective of its broader mandate.\n\nIn September 2013, the board of directors of the CCD announced that it was shutting its doors due to a lack of ongoing funding.

CIDI officially launched in 2012. By the middle of 2013 CIDI had secured its founding employer partners, had a staff of 5 and was operating in 4 cities across Canada.\n\nMerger talks began between the two organizations at the end of 2013.
