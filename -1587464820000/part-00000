{"title_page": "Gaullism", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in his general's uniform]]\n'''Gaullism''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Gaullisme}}) is a [[Politics of France|French political]] stance based on the thought and action of [[World War II]] [[French Resistance]] leader General [[Charles de Gaulle]], who would become the founding [[President of France|President]] of the [[Fifth French Republic]].{{sfn|Berstein|2001|pp=307-308}}\n\n[[Serge Berstein]] writes that Gaullism is \"neither a doctrine nor a [[political ideology]]\" and cannot be considered either [[Left-wing politics|left]] or [[Right-wing politics|right]].{{sfn|Berstein|2001|pp=307-308}} Rather, \"considering its historical progression, it is a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] exercise of power that is neither free from contradictions nor of concessions to momentary necessity, even if the imperious word of the general gives to the practice of Gaullism the allure of a program that seems profound and fully realized.\"{{sfn|Berstein|2001|pp=307-308}} Gaullism is \"a peculiarly French phenomenon, without doubt the quintessential French political phenomenon of the twentieth century.\"{{sfn|Berstein|2001|pp=307-308}}\n\n[[Lawrence D.

It was the brainchild of [[William Boeing]] and emerged from his consolidation of numerous carriers and equipment manufacturers from 1928 to 1930.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nUnited Airlines was the creation of aviation pioneer [[William Boeing]] who started out in the airplane business in 1916.  His Boeing Airplane Company, as it was then called, achieved the first international postal delivery in 1919 and he went on to establish United Aircraft Corp. in 1928.  It was this UAC that acquired mail and passenger service operator [[Pacific Air Transport]] on 1 January 1928, then, renamed Boeing Aircraft & Transport Co., merged with [[Pratt & Whitney]] Aircraft in early 1929 to form [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]] (UATC).  UATC acquired America's first scheduled passenger services carrier Stout Air Services on 29 April 1929, the nation's first scheduled service (mail only) operator [[Varney Air Lines]] in early 1930 and, finally, [[National Air Transport]] (a large Chicago-based mail-only carrier) on 7 May 1930.<ref>Davies, R.E.G., ''Airlines of the United States since 1914'', 1998, Smithsonian Institution Press, p. 75.</ref> On March 28, 1931, UATC formed the corporation '''United Air Lines, Inc.''' to manage its airline subsidiaries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,2296,00.html |title=United Airlines \u2013 Timeline (entry for March 28, 1931) |access-date=2011-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919171028/http://www.united.com/page/article/0%2C6722%2C2296%2C00.html |archive-date=2011-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Thus United Airlines makes the claim to be the oldest commercial airline in the United States by dint of its Varney acquisition.\n\nVarney was founded by [[Walter Varney]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho. Varney's chief pilot, [[Leon D. Cuddeback|Leon D. \"Lee\" Cuddeback]], flew the first contract [[air mail]] flight in a Swallow biplane from Varney's headquarters in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho, to the railroad mail hub at [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], Washington, on April 5, 1926 and returned the following day with 200 pounds of mail.<ref>History of Flight in the US [http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/flying/seventy_five_years.htm Seventy-Five Years United]</ref>  Varney Airlines' original 1925 [[hangar]] served as a portion of the terminal building for the [[Boise Airport]] until 2003, when the structure was replaced.\n\nThrough its string of successful acquisitions, by 1930, United Air Lines provided coast-to-coast passenger and mail services.  It took 27 hours to fly the route, one way.  Boeing Air Transport hired a [[registered nurse]], [[Ellen Church]], to assist passengers.

UATC's President [[Philip G. Johnson]] was forced to resign and moved to [[Trans-Canada Airlines]], the future [[Air Canada]]. UATC was broken into three separate companies. UATC's manufacturing interests east of the [[Mississippi River]] became [[United Aircraft]] (the future [[United Technologies]]), while its manufacturing interests west of the Mississippi became [[Boeing|Boeing Airplane Company]]. The airline interests became United Air Lines. The airline company's new president, hired to make a fresh start as airmail contracts were re-awarded in 1934, was [[William A.

The early connections became the basis of United [[Airline hub|hubs]] in Chicago and San Francisco and later in [[Denver]] and Washington, D.C. These remain United's principal hubs.\n\nUnited introduced the [[Boeing 247]] in 1933; for the first time passengers could fly across the US without an overnight stop or changing planes. That summer the fastest flight left Newark at noon (probably EST) and arrived San Francisco at 0655 PST after eight stops; fare was $160 one-way, equal to $2,868 in today's value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=160&year=1933|title=Calculate the value of $160 in 1933|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1950s United Air Lines 100,000 Mile Club 7-Star Member Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early 1950s \"100,000 Mile Club\" Award plaque (stars represent additional awards)]] [[File:United Airlines \"The Chicago Executive\".jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ad for \"Men only\" flight \"The Chicago Executive\"]]\nOn the night of October 10, 1933 a United [[Boeing 247]] [[1933 United Airlines Boeing 247 mid-air explosion|exploded in mid-air]] and crashed near [[Chesterton, Indiana|Chesterton]], Indiana, killing the seven people aboard. Investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a [[nitroglycerin]] bomb placed in the baggage hold. The [[United Airlines Chesterton Crash]] is believed to be the first proven case of air [[sabotage]] in commercial aviation history. No suspects or motives were ever found.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] United-trained ground crews modified airplanes for use as bombers, and transported mail, material, and passengers in support of the war effort.  The airline was quite busy covering the need for air transport across the United States during the war.  Its fleet of fifty aircraft were utilized at a rate of more than thirteen hours per day by 1945 (well above the pre-war rate of less than nine hours per day), flying 100,000 miles per day.<ref>{{cite journal |date=10 May 1945 |title=Working Overtime |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%200901.html |journal=Flight International |volume= |issue= |pages=497 |doi= |access-date=5 July 2016}}</ref> Post-war United benefited from new technologies (like the [[cabin pressurization|pressurized cabin]] which permitted planes to fly above the weather) and a boom in customer demand for air travel. This was the period in which [[Pan American Airways]] revived its Pacific route system that would later be acquired by United.\n\nIn 1954, United became the first airline with flight simulators that had visual, sound and motion cues for training pilots.  Purchased for US$3 million (1954) from Curtiss-Wright, these were the first modern simulators for training of commercial pilots.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AeADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CFMiT_23OIGvgwf68vjqCA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Airline Pilots Fly Anywhere in the world - Without Leaving the Ground.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1954, p. 87.</ref>\n[[File:6609-UAL-DC-6-NorthRampStapletonDEN.jpg|thumb|right|UAL DC-6 aircraft.

On June 30, 1956, [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision|Flight 718]] collided with a [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]] over the [[Grand Canyon]] in what was then the world's deadliest commercial airline disaster.

And on December 16, 1960, [[1960 New York mid-air collision|Flight 826]] hit another TWA Super Constellation over New York City.  These accidents helped pave the way for modern [[Air Traffic Control]].  Also in 1958, United received its first [[Douglas DC-8]], its first jet aircraft.\n\nUnited merged with [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] on June 1, 1961, displacing rival [[American Airlines]] as the world's second largest airline behind [[Aeroflot]] of the Soviet Union. The merger with Capital resulted in United operating the British-manufactured [[Vickers Viscount]] which was the only mainline turboprop aircraft ever flown by the airline.  Also in 1961, United began operating French-manufactured [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] jetliners and was the only U.S. airline ever to operate the Caravelle in scheduled passenger service.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1961 United Air Lines system timetable</ref>  In 1968 the company reorganized, creating UAL Corporation with United Airlines as a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nUnited took delivery of their first [[Boeing 747]]s in August 1970,<ref>Roach and Eastwood, 2003, p. 332</ref> initially operating them on longer routes within the United States.  A year later, United, along with American, were the launch customers for the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], which for many years served as a workhorse in both airlines' fleets and others around the world.\n\nUnited Airlines is the only airline to have operated [[Executive One]], the designation given to a civil flight carrying the U.S. President. On December 23, 1973 then President [[Richard Nixon]] flew aboard a United DC-10 flight from Washington Dulles to Los Angeles.

The flight attendants voted to not participate in the deal, and at the beginning some wore buttons saying \"we just work here.\" The Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) made United the largest [[employee-owned corporation]] in the world. United used the opportunity to create a low-cost subsidiary, [[Shuttle by United]], in an attempt to compete with [[low-cost carrier]]s.\n\nUnited used its employee-ownership in its marketing communications, with slogans such as \"the employee-owners of United invite you to come fly the friendly skies,\" \"we don't just work here,\" and \"thank you for calling United Airlines; please hold and one of our owner-representatives will be with you shortly.\"\n\nThe financial outcomes of the ESOP were decidedly uneven for different players. As part of ESOP agreement, United CEO [[Stephen Wolf]] resigned and took a consulting job with [[Lazard Freres]], the very investment company he had hired to advise United's board during the ESOP buyout process. Stewart Oran, the key legal advisor to the pilots' union, received a {{Nowrap|$5.5 million}} package to join the management of the new employee-owned company as legal counsel after the ESOP was formed.<ref>''USA Today'', \"Workers took pay cut while others got rich,\" July 12, 1995.</ref> United's unions, having larger voice in running the company, later successfully bargained for significant pay increases, but the effect was only short-term. The rank and file employees were locked into their stock, which got wiped out in the eventual bankruptcy.\nIt was around this period (in 1993) that United introduced its grey and blue color scheme. It had been criticized that the color scheme blended with the darkness during nighttime operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/col/smith/2003/05/09/askthepilot40/index.html?pn=2|title=Ask the pilot{{spaced ndash}}Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=2011-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606162107/http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/col/smith/2003/05/09/askthepilot40/index.html?pn=2#|archive-date=2011-06-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Turn-of-the-3rd-millennium developments===\n\nIn 1989, United orders the then-new Boeing 747-400.\n\nIn 1993, United phased out the 'Saul Bass' livery and introduced the 'Battleship Gray' livery to their fleet.\n\nIn 1997, United co-founded the [[Star Alliance]] with [[Air Canada]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]] and [[Thai Airways International|Thai Airways]].

The offer drew immediate scorn from consumer groups and employees of both airlines. By the following year, regulatory sentiment was against the deal, and United withdrew the offer just before the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] barred the merger on [[antitrust]] grounds in July. The two airlines subsequently formed an amicable partnership that led to [[US Airways]]' entrance into the Star Alliance.\n\nMay 2000 also saw a bitter contract dispute between United and its pilots' union. The pilots wanted their pay restored to the levels that existed prior to the pay cuts and concessions that were taken to fund the ESOP. Planning for the busy summer season, United had counted on its pilots flying overtime. However, the pilots could not be forced to work overtime, and most pilots refused to fly the extra hours. Although United knew they would have to cancel numerous flights if this were to happen, they did not hire new pilots to make up for the potential shortage. Over the summer, United had to cancel a large portion of its schedule at its major hubs. Eventually, CEO Jim Goodwin and the rest of the management had to get the pilots back in the cockpits and quickly offered the pilots a 48% increase over four years with up to 28% upfront.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===September 11, 2001 attacks===\nAs part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], two of the four planes hijacked were United planes.

The other was N591UA, a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757\u2013222]] operating as [[United Airlines Flight 93]], which crashed in rural Pennsylvania after the passengers fought back against the hijackers, and was suspected to have been directed towards the [[United States Capitol]] building according to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]].\n\n===Bankruptcy and reorganization===<!-- This section is linked from [[Delta Air Lines]] -->\n[[File:United Airlines Airbus A320 (N416UA) landing at San Jose International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320-200]] landing at [[Norman Y.

This increase was only temporary and when the bubble finally burst, United was in a worse position than before because it had failed to keep costs under control, possibly due to giving its pilots pay raises of up to 28% in the summer of 2000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zuckerman |first=Laurence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/24/business/a-leapfrog-pattern-in-pay-pacts-for-airline-pilots.html |title=A Leapfrog Pattern in Pay Pacts for Airline Pilots |work=The New York Times  |date=April 24, 2001 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref> Coupled with a battered network, the post-9/11 decline in air travel and skyrocketing oil prices, the company lost $2.14&nbsp;billion in 2001 on revenues of {{Nowrap|$16.14 billion}}.

Tens of thousands of workers were [[furlough]]ed, and all city ticket offices in the US closed. The airline canceled several existing and planned routes, and eliminated its entire Latin American gateway and flight crew base at [[Miami International Airport]] after March 1, 2004. Furthermore, they reduced their [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] fleet from 557 (before 9/11) to 460 aircraft.\n[[File:B747 N105UA EDDF 2009-08-09.jpg|thumb|A United [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Frankfurt Airport]]]]\n\nAt the same time, the airline continued to invest in new projects. On November 12, 2003, it launched a new [[low-cost carrier]], [[Ted (airline)|Ted]], to compete with other low-cost airlines. In 2004 it launched its luxury [[United p.s.|\"p.s.\"]] (for \"premium service\") service on re-configured Boeing 757-200s from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] in New York City to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service was targeted to business customers and high-end leisure customers in the coast-to-coast market. In February 2004, the airline introduced the new Blue and White livery, commonly called the 'Rising Blue' livery, with the Blue Tulip on the tail to coincide with a new advertising campaign.\n\nFinancial pressure on the airline was heavy. The [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] epidemic in 2003 depressed traffic on United's extensive Pacific network. The spikes in the price of jet fuel ate away remaining profits United made. United implemented several fare hikes on overseas routes, citing rising fuel costs, in 2004 and 2005. Two days after its triumphant first flight to Vietnam, United announced that it would cut U.S. flight capacity by 14% after the holidays and add more international flights, which were more profitable.\n\nUnited took advantage of its Chapter 11 status to negotiate hard-to-cut costs with employees, suppliers, and contractors, including cancellation of feeder contracts with [[United Express]] carriers [[Atlantic Coast Airlines]] (which became [[Independence Air]]) and [[Air Wisconsin]] (which became a [[US Airways Express]] carrier).\n\nMost controversial of all, however, was the 2005 cancellation of its pension plan, the largest such default in U.S. corporate history. It renegotiated its contracts with the pilots' and mechanics' unions and the Association of Flight Attendants for lower pay. Criticism was also leveled at the CEO, Glenn Tilton, for demanding pay cuts from employees while receiving the highest salary of any major U.S. airline CEO.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/20/05ceoland.html|title=CEO Compensation|first=Edited by Scott|last=DeCarlo|date=21 April 2005|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOriginally slated to exit bankruptcy protection after 2\u00bd years in the third quarter of 2005, United requested yet another extension in light of record-high fuel prices. On August 26, 2005, the bankruptcy court extended the airline's exclusive right to file a reorganization plan to November 1, although it also stated firmly this extension would be the last. United announced at the same time it had raised {{Nowrap|$3 billion}} in exit financing and filed its Plan of Reorganization, as announced, on September 7, 2005.\n\nThe bankruptcy court approved the restructuring plan on January 20, 2006, clearing the way for United to exit bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, and finally return to normal operations.\n\n===Beyond Chapter 11===\n[[File:Boeing 777-222ER - United Airlines (N794UA).JPG|thumb|United Airlines Boeing 777-200 landing in the Blue Tulip livery.

December 23, 2011. Retrieved on December 24, 2011.</ref> At the time, there was no real logo for the airline and Bass noted that the brand direction was not clearly evident. The \"[[tulip]]\" logo of colored stripes representing overlapping letter \"U\"s was in use beginning 1974, with only slight modification, until the Continental merger. The \"Rainbow\" (or \"Saul Bass\") livery, which was the first to feature the \"tulip\", had a primarily white fuselage, with red, orange and blue stripes along the \"cheatline\". This livery remained in use for 19 years, with a slight update in 1988 that moved the colored stripes further down the fuselage to allow the \"UNITED\" font to be larger than before. Marketing during this time continued the \"Fly the Friendly Skies\" slogan, and it was during this era that United acquired the rights to use Gerswhin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which started to be heard in broadcast advertisements. Other than the re-introduction in 1979 of the single word \"AIRLINES\" (once again appearing as \"UNITED AIRLINES\") in advertising and printed materials, the Bass branding would remain until early 1993.\n\nAt the request of then-CEO Stephen Wolf, in 1993 United completely revised its branding and livery, with the collaboration of [[CKS Group]], to a primarily grey and dark blue fuselage, with blue stripes on the tail. A custom Times New Roman font, reading \"UNITED AIRLINES\" in white, replaced Saul Bass's previous lettering style. The familiar \"tulip\" logo remained, although slightly smaller. As a homage to the previous livery, narrow red, orange and blue stripes appeared between the grey and the dark blue. This so-called \"Battleship\" livery was intended to project a more business-like, global image for the airline, which was rapidly expanding internationally. Indeed, the words \"Worldwide Service\" were displayed near the front of the aircraft. Naturally, signage and printed materials reflected the change, often using the light blue on dark blue striped design of the aircraft tail-fin, along with the newly updated font and, of course, the \"tulip.\"\n\n[[File:2010-07-15 B767 UA N663UA EDDF 02.jpg|thumb|A United Airlines [[Boeing 767#767-300ER|Boeing 767-300ER]] in the \"Rising Blue\" livery used from 2004 until the merger with Continental.]]\n\nIn 1997, United commissioned Pentagram to update the brand. Pentagram soon decided to keep the \"tulip\", in view of its strong brand-recognition. Pentagram designed a new \"UNITED\" font that appeared in advertisements, signage and printed material, but did not appear on the aircraft themselves until United's next livery re-design. This arrived on February 18, 2004, when the \"Rising Blue\" (or \"Blue Tulip\") livery was introduced, intended to signal a fresh start once the company emerged from bankruptcy protection. As it turned out, United's bankruptcy took longer to resolve than expected; consequently the new branding was actually launched two years sooner. The fresh livery featured a white upper fuselage, replacing the dark grey of the previous design, and used a lighter shade of blue for the aircraft belly, tail and engines. In an echo of the previous two liveries, a series of progressively lighter blue lateral stripes lay between the white upper fuselage and the blue of the aircraft underside. The aircraft tail-fin featured an enlarged and cropped version of the \"tulip,\" shaded with a bluish tint.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Boeing 747 United SDASM.jpg|747 in pre-1974 \"Stars and Bars\" livery\nFile:Boeing 747-123, United Airlines AN1045539.jpg|747 at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] wearing [[Saul Bass]]-designed \"Tulip\" livery (1974\u20131993)\nFile:UAL 744 (2224965685).jpg|747 wearing \"Battleship\" livery (1993\u20132004)\nFile:2 United 747.JPG|747 in \"Rising Blue\" or \"Blue Tulip\" livery (2004\u201310)\nFile:United Airlines Boeing 747-400; N177UA@SYD;06.07.2012 661bs (7744467692).jpg|Post-merger 747 in \"Globe\" livery (2010\u20132019)\nFile:United Airlines A320 in the New Livery.jpg|A320 at [[San Francisco International Airport]] wearing the newest livery (2019-present) \n</gallery>\n\nOn May 3, 2010, it was announced that United and [[Continental Airlines]] would merge.<ref>Smith, Aaron.

Much criticism was directed at CEO Jeff Smisek, who flatly admitted that he and former United CEO Glenn Tilton personally came up with the \"new\" brand and livery themselves, with no outside input or any consulting with either company's marketing departments.<ref name=\"Mouawad2\"/>\n\n[[File:B777, B474, and A319's at SFO International.jpg|thumb|upright|An assortment of United Airlines aircraft at [[San Francisco International Airport]] with post-merger Continental \"globe\" and earlier \"tulip\" logos in 2011, including two [[Boeing 747-400]]s, two [[Boeing 777-200ER]]s, and one [[Airbus A319]].]]\nIn conjunction with the newly adopted livery, in August 2010 the \"United\" lettering was updated in accordance with the previous Continental typeface, but presented entirely in upper-case lettering and slightly adjusted to bear a resemblance to United's own previous style.

The new livery retains the white upper fuselage and gray belly.

His Boeing Airplane Company, as it was then called, achieved the first international postal delivery in 1919 and he went on to establish United Aircraft Corp. in 1928.  It was this UAC that acquired mail and passenger service operator [[Pacific Air Transport]] on 1 January 1928, then, renamed Boeing Aircraft & Transport Co., merged with [[Pratt & Whitney]] Aircraft in early 1929 to form [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation]] (UATC).  UATC acquired America's first scheduled passenger services carrier Stout Air Services on 29 April 1929, the nation's first scheduled service (mail only) operator [[Varney Air Lines]] in early 1930 and, finally, [[National Air Transport]] (a large Chicago-based mail-only carrier) on 7 May 1930.<ref>Davies, R.E.G., ''Airlines of the United States since 1914'', 1998, Smithsonian Institution Press, p. 75.</ref> On March 28, 1931, UATC formed the corporation '''United Air Lines, Inc.''' to manage its airline subsidiaries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6722,2296,00.html |title=United Airlines \u2013 Timeline (entry for March 28, 1931) |access-date=2011-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919171028/http://www.united.com/page/article/0%2C6722%2C2296%2C00.html |archive-date=2011-09-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Thus United Airlines makes the claim to be the oldest commercial airline in the United States by dint of its Varney acquisition.\n\nVarney was founded by [[Walter Varney]] in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho. Varney's chief pilot, [[Leon D. Cuddeback|Leon D. \"Lee\" Cuddeback]], flew the first contract [[air mail]] flight in a Swallow biplane from Varney's headquarters in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], Idaho, to the railroad mail hub at [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]], Washington, on April 5, 1926 and returned the following day with 200 pounds of mail.<ref>History of Flight in the US [http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/flying/seventy_five_years.htm Seventy-Five Years United]</ref>  Varney Airlines' original 1925 [[hangar]] served as a portion of the terminal building for the [[Boise Airport]] until 2003, when the structure was replaced.\n\nThrough its string of successful acquisitions, by 1930, United Air Lines provided coast-to-coast passenger and mail services.  It took 27 hours to fly the route, one way.  Boeing Air Transport hired a [[registered nurse]], [[Ellen Church]], to assist passengers.

UATC's President [[Philip G. Johnson]] was forced to resign and moved to [[Trans-Canada Airlines]], the future [[Air Canada]]. UATC was broken into three separate companies. UATC's manufacturing interests east of the [[Mississippi River]] became [[United Aircraft]] (the future [[United Technologies]]), while its manufacturing interests west of the Mississippi became [[Boeing|Boeing Airplane Company]]. The airline interests became United Air Lines. The airline company's new president, hired to make a fresh start as airmail contracts were re-awarded in 1934, was [[William A.

The early connections became the basis of United [[Airline hub|hubs]] in Chicago and San Francisco and later in [[Denver]] and Washington, D.C. These remain United's principal hubs.\n\nUnited introduced the [[Boeing 247]] in 1933; for the first time passengers could fly across the US without an overnight stop or changing planes. That summer the fastest flight left Newark at noon (probably EST) and arrived San Francisco at 0655 PST after eight stops; fare was $160 one-way, equal to $2,868 in today's value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=160&year=1933|title=Calculate the value of $160 in 1933|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1950s United Air Lines 100,000 Mile Club 7-Star Member Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early 1950s \"100,000 Mile Club\" Award plaque (stars represent additional awards)]] [[File:United Airlines \"The Chicago Executive\".jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ad for \"Men only\" flight \"The Chicago Executive\"]]\nOn the night of October 10, 1933 a United [[Boeing 247]] [[1933 United Airlines Boeing 247 mid-air explosion|exploded in mid-air]] and crashed near [[Chesterton, Indiana|Chesterton]], Indiana, killing the seven people aboard. Investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a [[nitroglycerin]] bomb placed in the baggage hold. The [[United Airlines Chesterton Crash]] is believed to be the first proven case of air [[sabotage]] in commercial aviation history. No suspects or motives were ever found.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] United-trained ground crews modified airplanes for use as bombers, and transported mail, material, and passengers in support of the war effort.  The airline was quite busy covering the need for air transport across the United States during the war.

On June 30, 1956, [[1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision|Flight 718]] collided with a [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation]] over the [[Grand Canyon]] in what was then the world's deadliest commercial airline disaster.

And on December 16, 1960, [[1960 New York mid-air collision|Flight 826]] hit another TWA Super Constellation over New York City.  These accidents helped pave the way for modern [[Air Traffic Control]].  Also in 1958, United received its first [[Douglas DC-8]], its first jet aircraft.\n\nUnited merged with [[Capital Airlines (United States)|Capital Airlines]] on June 1, 1961, displacing rival [[American Airlines]] as the world's second largest airline behind [[Aeroflot]] of the Soviet Union. The merger with Capital resulted in United operating the British-manufactured [[Vickers Viscount]] which was the only mainline turboprop aircraft ever flown by the airline.  Also in 1961, United began operating French-manufactured [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] jetliners and was the only U.S. airline ever to operate the Caravelle in scheduled passenger service.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1961 United Air Lines system timetable</ref>  In 1968 the company reorganized, creating UAL Corporation with United Airlines as a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\nUnited took delivery of their first [[Boeing 747]]s in August 1970,<ref>Roach and Eastwood, 2003, p. 332</ref> initially operating them on longer routes within the United States.

United became a proponent of deregulation due to its perception that regulation, as it then existed, was a major constraint on United's ability to profitably grow. After years of focused work to bring about deregulation, the [[1978 Airline Deregulation Act]] became law.\n[[File:AT PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NARA - 548166.jpg|thumb|right|Two planes at [[Portland International Airport]] in May 1973.]]\nIn 1985, United agreed to buy the ailing [[Pan American World Airways]] entire Pacific Division, {{Nowrap|Boeing 747SPs}}, and L-1011-500s, and flight crew staffs for {{Nowrap|$750 million}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=United Airlines to Buy Pan Am Pacific Division|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-22/news/mn-22005_1_united-airlines|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-11-20|author=Associated Press|date=August 22, 1985}}</ref> By late 1986, United flew to 13 Pacific destinations, most of which were purchased from Pan Am.\n\nEconomic turmoil during the 1970s which led to \"stagflation\", labor unrest, and the pressures of the 1978 [[Airline Deregulation Act]] greatly hampered the industry and United, which incurred losses at a time when it was also undergoing changes at the top of both United Airlines and its parent company UAL Corp. Some changes were due largely to the retirement of long term senior management members as well as performance driven changes at the very top in 1969 and again in 1985 following the pilot strike.\n\nIn May 1981, one week after rival [[American Airlines]] launched [[AAdvantage]], the first modern [[frequent flyer program]], United launched its [[Mileage Plus]].\n\nIn 1982, United was the launch carrier for the [[Boeing 767-200]], receiving its first 767-200s on August 19.\n\nIn 1984, United was the first airline to serve all 50 states with commercial airports when it started flights to [[Atlanta]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]], [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], and [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].\n\n===Strike of 1985===\nOn May 17, 1985, United's pilots went on a 29-day strike claiming the CEO, Richard Ferris, was trying to \"break the unions.\" They used management's proposed \"B-scale\" pilot pay rates as proof.<ref>\"[http://cf.alpa.org/internet/safetytimeline/Labor1980s.htm Pilot Labor History-1985] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001000741/http://cf.alpa.org/internet/safetytimeline/Labor1980s.htm |date=2011-10-01 }}\" ''Strike thwarted attempt to break pilots' union'', alpa.org</ref> American Airlines already had a non-merging B-scale for its pilots.<ref>\"ALPA-MEC letter 6\u20137\u201385\" ''Letter to all UAL pilots, explaining details of the last minute negotiations''</ref> Ferris insisted United had to have pilot costs no higher than American's, so he offered United pilots a \"word-for-word\" contract to match American's, or the same bottom line numbers. The United [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|ALPA]]-MEC rejected that offer. The only choice left, to achieve parity with American's pilot costs, was to begin a B-scale for United's new-hire pilots.<ref>\"Hard Landing\" ''1995, by Thomas Petzinger, Chapter 10''</ref>\n\n[[File:United Airlines Boeing 737-222 Marmet.jpg|left|thumb|United 737-200 in the 1974\u20131993 ''Rainbow Scheme'']]\nFerris wanted that B-scale to merge in the [[Pilot in command|captain's ranks]], which was more generous than American's B-scale, that never merged at all.

Lee Bailey, declared the strike was on at {{Nowrap|12:01&nbsp;am}}, on May 17, without further consulting the negotiators, some of whom believed they\ncould find agreement on all contract terms, if the negotiations were allowed to continue. Moments before the ALPA announced strike deadline, they began a \"countdown of the final 30 seconds from Chicago\" (the Odeum teleconference). Doing that made it impossible to extend the strike deadline, so that the final issues could be resolved without a strike.<ref>\"UAL letter, 5\u201321\u201385\" ''Letter to all UAL pilots, explaining the remaining issues when the strike was called''</ref><ref>\"Airline Pilot Magazine, July 1985\" ''Standing United, pages 8\u201315''</ref>\n\nMr. Ferris changed United's parent company's name from UAL Corporation to Allegis in February 1987 but the name change was short lived.<ref name=\"AgainUAL\">\"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE5D9103EF934A15756C0A96E948260 United's Parent Is Again UAL].\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref><ref>\"United Once More.\" ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''.

The flight attendants voted to not participate in the deal, and at the beginning some wore buttons saying \"we just work here.\" The Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) made United the largest [[employee-owned corporation]] in the world. United used the opportunity to create a low-cost subsidiary, [[Shuttle by United]], in an attempt to compete with [[low-cost carrier]]s.\n\nUnited used its employee-ownership in its marketing communications, with slogans such as \"the employee-owners of United invite you to come fly the friendly skies,\" \"we don't just work here,\" and \"thank you for calling United Airlines; please hold and one of our owner-representatives will be with you shortly.\"\n\nThe financial outcomes of the ESOP were decidedly uneven for different players. As part of ESOP agreement, United CEO [[Stephen Wolf]] resigned and took a consulting job with [[Lazard Freres]], the very investment company he had hired to advise United's board during the ESOP buyout process. Stewart Oran, the key legal advisor to the pilots' union, received a {{Nowrap|$5.5 million}} package to join the management of the new employee-owned company as legal counsel after the ESOP was formed.<ref>''USA Today'', \"Workers took pay cut while others got rich,\" July 12, 1995.</ref> United's unions, having larger voice in running the company, later successfully bargained for significant pay increases, but the effect was only short-term.

By the following year, regulatory sentiment was against the deal, and United withdrew the offer just before the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] barred the merger on [[antitrust]] grounds in July. The two airlines subsequently formed an amicable partnership that led to [[US Airways]]' entrance into the Star Alliance.\n\nMay 2000 also saw a bitter contract dispute between United and its pilots' union. The pilots wanted their pay restored to the levels that existed prior to the pay cuts and concessions that were taken to fund the ESOP. Planning for the busy summer season, United had counted on its pilots flying overtime. However, the pilots could not be forced to work overtime, and most pilots refused to fly the extra hours. Although United knew they would have to cancel numerous flights if this were to happen, they did not hire new pilots to make up for the potential shortage. Over the summer, United had to cancel a large portion of its schedule at its major hubs. Eventually, CEO Jim Goodwin and the rest of the management had to get the pilots back in the cockpits and quickly offered the pilots a 48% increase over four years with up to 28% upfront.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===September 11, 2001 attacks===\nAs part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], two of the four planes hijacked were United planes.

Furthermore, they reduced their [[mainline (flight)|mainline]] fleet from 557 (before 9/11) to 460 aircraft.\n[[File:B747 N105UA EDDF 2009-08-09.jpg|thumb|A United [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Frankfurt Airport]]]]\n\nAt the same time, the airline continued to invest in new projects. On November 12, 2003, it launched a new [[low-cost carrier]], [[Ted (airline)|Ted]], to compete with other low-cost airlines. In 2004 it launched its luxury [[United p.s.|\"p.s.\"]] (for \"premium service\") service on re-configured Boeing 757-200s from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] in New York City to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service was targeted to business customers and high-end leisure customers in the coast-to-coast market. In February 2004, the airline introduced the new Blue and White livery, commonly called the 'Rising Blue' livery, with the Blue Tulip on the tail to coincide with a new advertising campaign.\n\nFinancial pressure on the airline was heavy. The [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome|SARS]] epidemic in 2003 depressed traffic on United's extensive Pacific network. The spikes in the price of jet fuel ate away remaining profits United made. United implemented several fare hikes on overseas routes, citing rising fuel costs, in 2004 and 2005. Two days after its triumphant first flight to Vietnam, United announced that it would cut U.S. flight capacity by 14% after the holidays and add more international flights, which were more profitable.\n\nUnited took advantage of its Chapter 11 status to negotiate hard-to-cut costs with employees, suppliers, and contractors, including cancellation of feeder contracts with [[United Express]] carriers [[Atlantic Coast Airlines]] (which became [[Independence Air]]) and [[Air Wisconsin]] (which became a [[US Airways Express]] carrier).\n\nMost controversial of all, however, was the 2005 cancellation of its pension plan, the largest such default in U.S. corporate history. It renegotiated its contracts with the pilots' and mechanics' unions and the Association of Flight Attendants for lower pay. Criticism was also leveled at the CEO, Glenn Tilton, for demanding pay cuts from employees while receiving the highest salary of any major U.S. airline CEO.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/04/20/05ceoland.html|title=CEO Compensation|first=Edited by Scott|last=DeCarlo|date=21 April 2005|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOriginally slated to exit bankruptcy protection after 2\u00bd years in the third quarter of 2005, United requested yet another extension in light of record-high fuel prices. On August 26, 2005, the bankruptcy court extended the airline's exclusive right to file a reorganization plan to November 1, although it also stated firmly this extension would be the last. United announced at the same time it had raised {{Nowrap|$3 billion}} in exit financing and filed its Plan of Reorganization, as announced, on September 7, 2005.\n\nThe bankruptcy court approved the restructuring plan on January 20, 2006, clearing the way for United to exit bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, and finally return to normal operations.\n\n===Beyond Chapter 11===\n[[File:Boeing 777-222ER - United Airlines (N794UA).JPG|thumb|United Airlines Boeing 777-200 landing in the Blue Tulip livery.

Before 1974 and after the use of the shield logo was discontinued, United advertisements and signage usually advertised to customers to \"Come Fly the Friendly Skies of United\" in a font identical to the \"United\" font on the \"Friendship\" livery of the early 1970s.\n\n[[File:United Airlines logo (1973 - 2010).svg|thumb|250px|The United Airlines logo used before the merger with Continental.

December 23, 2011. Retrieved on December 24, 2011.</ref> At the time, there was no real logo for the airline and Bass noted that the brand direction was not clearly evident. The \"[[tulip]]\" logo of colored stripes representing overlapping letter \"U\"s was in use beginning 1974, with only slight modification, until the Continental merger. The \"Rainbow\" (or \"Saul Bass\") livery, which was the first to feature the \"tulip\", had a primarily white fuselage, with red, orange and blue stripes along the \"cheatline\". This livery remained in use for 19 years, with a slight update in 1988 that moved the colored stripes further down the fuselage to allow the \"UNITED\" font to be larger than before. Marketing during this time continued the \"Fly the Friendly Skies\" slogan, and it was during this era that United acquired the rights to use Gerswhin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which started to be heard in broadcast advertisements. Other than the re-introduction in 1979 of the single word \"AIRLINES\" (once again appearing as \"UNITED AIRLINES\") in advertising and printed materials, the Bass branding would remain until early 1993.\n\nAt the request of then-CEO Stephen Wolf, in 1993 United completely revised its branding and livery, with the collaboration of [[CKS Group]], to a primarily grey and dark blue fuselage, with blue stripes on the tail. A custom Times New Roman font, reading \"UNITED AIRLINES\" in white, replaced Saul Bass's previous lettering style. The familiar \"tulip\" logo remained, although slightly smaller. As a homage to the previous livery, narrow red, orange and blue stripes appeared between the grey and the dark blue. This so-called \"Battleship\" livery was intended to project a more business-like, global image for the airline, which was rapidly expanding internationally. Indeed, the words \"Worldwide Service\" were displayed near the front of the aircraft. Naturally, signage and printed materials reflected the change, often using the light blue on dark blue striped design of the aircraft tail-fin, along with the newly updated font and, of course, the \"tulip.\"\n\n[[File:2010-07-15 B767 UA N663UA EDDF 02.jpg|thumb|A United Airlines [[Boeing 767#767-300ER|Boeing 767-300ER]] in the \"Rising Blue\" livery used from 2004 until the merger with Continental.]]\n\nIn 1997, United commissioned Pentagram to update the brand. Pentagram soon decided to keep the \"tulip\", in view of its strong brand-recognition. Pentagram designed a new \"UNITED\" font that appeared in advertisements, signage and printed material, but did not appear on the aircraft themselves until United's next livery re-design. This arrived on February 18, 2004, when the \"Rising Blue\" (or \"Blue Tulip\") livery was introduced, intended to signal a fresh start once the company emerged from bankruptcy protection. As it turned out, United's bankruptcy took longer to resolve than expected; consequently the new branding was actually launched two years sooner. The fresh livery featured a white upper fuselage, replacing the dark grey of the previous design, and used a lighter shade of blue for the aircraft belly, tail and engines. In an echo of the previous two liveries, a series of progressively lighter blue lateral stripes lay between the white upper fuselage and the blue of the aircraft underside. The aircraft tail-fin featured an enlarged and cropped version of the \"tulip,\" shaded with a bluish tint.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n{{clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Boeing 747 United SDASM.jpg|747 in pre-1974 \"Stars and Bars\" livery\nFile:Boeing 747-123, United Airlines AN1045539.jpg|747 at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Charles de Gaulle]] wearing [[Saul Bass]]-designed \"Tulip\" livery (1974\u20131993)\nFile:UAL 744 (2224965685).jpg|747 wearing \"Battleship\" livery (1993\u20132004)\nFile:2 United 747.JPG|747 in \"Rising Blue\" or \"Blue Tulip\" livery (2004\u201310)\nFile:United Airlines Boeing 747-400; N177UA@SYD;06.07.2012 661bs (7744467692).jpg|Post-merger 747 in \"Globe\" livery (2010\u20132019)\nFile:United Airlines A320 in the New Livery.jpg|A320 at [[San Francisco International Airport]] wearing the newest livery (2019-present) \n</gallery>\n\nOn May 3, 2010, it was announced that United and [[Continental Airlines]] would merge.<ref>Smith, Aaron.

Much criticism was directed at CEO Jeff Smisek, who flatly admitted that he and former United CEO Glenn Tilton personally came up with the \"new\" brand and livery themselves, with no outside input or any consulting with either company's marketing departments.<ref name=\"Mouawad2\"/>\n\n[[File:B777, B474, and A319's at SFO International.jpg|thumb|upright|An assortment of United Airlines aircraft at [[San Francisco International Airport]] with post-merger Continental \"globe\" and earlier \"tulip\" logos in 2011, including two [[Boeing 747-400]]s, two [[Boeing 777-200ER]]s, and one [[Airbus A319]].]]\nIn conjunction with the newly adopted livery, in August 2010 the \"United\" lettering was updated in accordance with the previous Continental typeface, but presented entirely in upper-case lettering and slightly adjusted to bear a resemblance to United's own previous style.

It is characterised by the processes of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref name=\"Shrek\">{{cite web |last1=Shrek |first1=S |title=Prenatal Development Definition and Patient Education |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |website=web.archive.org |accessdate=21 April 2020 |date=1 December 2013}}</ref>\nEmbryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the [[trophoblast]]) and an [[inner cell mass]]. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the [[zona pellucida]]. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the [[blastula]].) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to [[zona hatching|hatch]] through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.<ref>http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the [[pre-embryo]],<ref name=\"opentext\">{{cite web |title=28.2 Embryonic Development \u2013 Anatomy and Physiology |url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/28-2-embryonic-development/ |website=opentextbc.ca}}</ref> the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer.

These columns are known as [[Chorionic villi|primary villi]]. At the same time, other migrating cells form into the exocelomic cavity a new cavity named the secondary or definitive yolk sac, smaller than the primitive yolk sac.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Moore/>\n\n=== Implantation ===\n{{Main|Implantation (human embryo)}}\n[[File:Gray36.png|thumb|200px|Trophoblast differentiation]]\nAfter [[ovulation]], the endometrial lining becomes transformed into a secretory lining in preparation of accepting the embryo. It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Other villi, called terminal or free villi, exchange nutrients. The embryo is joined to the trophoblastic shell by a narrow connecting stalk that develops into the umbilical cord to attach the placenta to the embryo.<ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Smith/>\nArteries in the decidua are remodelled to increase the maternal blood flow into the intervillous spaces of the placenta, allowing [[Respiration (physiology)|gas exchange]] and the transfer of nutrients to the embryo. Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of [[neurulation]] can begin.\n\n==Neurulation==\n{{Main|Neurulation}}\n[[File:Neural crest.svg|220px|thumb|left|Neural plate]]\n[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.png|thumb|280px|Neural tube development]]\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and [[nervous tissue|neural tissue]], and the gastrula is now referred to as the [[neurula]].

[[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]].

These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords.

This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]\nthe [[intraventricular septum|septum inferius]] also forms which develops into the muscular [[interventricular septum]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\n===Digestive system===\n{{Main |Development of the digestive system}}\nThe digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.\n\n=== Respiratory system ===\nThe respiratory system develops from the [[lung bud]], which appears in the ventral wall of the foregut about four weeks into development. The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes). Tertiary bronchi form from secondary bronchi.\n\nWhile the internal lining of the [[larynx]] originates from the [[lung bud]], its cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth [[pharyngeal arch]]es.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Langman's medical embryology.|last=W.)|first=Sadler, T.

All three are derived from the [[intermediate mesoderm]].\n\n===== Pronephros =====\nThe [[pronephros]] derives from the intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region. It is not functional and degenerates before the end of the fourth week.\n\n===== Mesonephros =====\nThe [[mesonephros]] derives from intermediate mesoderm in the upper thoracic to upper lumbar segments. Excretory tubules are formed and enter the [[mesonephric duct]], which ends in the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]]. The mesonephric duct atrophies in females, but participate in [[development of the reproductive system]] in males.\n\n===== Metanephros =====\nThe metanephros appears in the fifth week of development. An outgrowth of the mesonephric duct, the [[ureteric bud]], penetrates metanephric tissue to form the primitive [[renal pelvis]], [[Renal calyx|renal calyces]] and [[renal pyramids]]. The [[ureter]] is also formed.\n\n==== Bladder and urethra ====\nBetween the fourth and seventh weeks of development, the [[urorectal septum]] divides the [[Cloaca (embryology)|cloaca]] into the [[urogenital sinus]] and the [[anal canal]].

The deeper layer, the [[dermis]], is derived from [[mesenchyme]].\n\nThe formation of the epidermis begins in the second month of development and it acquires its definitive arrangement at the end of the fourth month. The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual [[Epidermis#Layers|layers of the epidermis]].\n\nThe mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources:\n\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from [[paraxial mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from [[Neural crest|neural crest cells]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n{{Main|Development of the nervous system in humans |Development of the human brain}}\n[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|240px|Development of brain in 8 week old embryo]]\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube bends ventrally as the [[Flexure (embryology)|cephalic flexure]] at the level of the future [[midbrain]]\u2014the [[mesencephalon]].

The [[alar plate]] of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the telencephalon) whilst its [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]] becomes the diencephalon.

These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[otic pit]]s, and then [[otic vesicle]]s. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.\n\nThe ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].\n\nThe dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].\n\n==== Middle ear ====\nThe [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube.\n\nThe [[bone]]s of the middle ear, the [[ossicles]], derive from the cartilages of the [[pharyngeal arch]]es. The [[malleus]] and [[incus]] derive from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#First arch|first pharyngeal arch]], whereas the [[stapes]] derives from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#Second arch|second pharyngeal arch]].\n\n==== Outer ear ====\nThe [[Ear canal|external auditory meatus]] develops from the dorsal portion of the first [[Pharyngeal groove|pharyngeal cleft]].

This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis. This allows embryos that are not affected by defined genetic diseases to be selected and then transferred to the mother's [[uterus]].\n\n[[Sacrococcygeal teratoma]]s, tumours formed from different types of tissue, that can form, are thought to be related to primitive streak remnants, which ordinarily disappear.<ref name=Carlson/><ref name=Sadler/><ref name=Larsen/>\n\n[[First arch syndrome]]s are [[congenital disorder]]s of facial deformities, caused by the failure of neural crest cells to migrate to the first pharyngeal arch.\n\n[[Spina bifida]] a [[congenital disorder]] is the result of the incomplete closure of the neural tube.\n\n[[Vertically transmitted infection]]s can be passed from the mother to the unborn child at any stage of its [[prenatal development|development]].\n\n[[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] a condition of inadequate oxygen supply can be a serious consequence of a [[preterm birth|preterm]] or premature birth.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Aorta-gonad-mesonephros]]\n* [[CDX2]]\n* [[Development of the reproductive system]]\n* [[Development of the urinary system]]\n* [[Developmental biology]]\n* [[Drosophila embryogenesis]]\n* [[Embryomics]]\n* [[Gonadogenesis]]\n* [[Human tooth development]]\n* [[List of human cell types derived from the germ layers]]\n* [[Potential person]]\n* [[Recapitulation theory]]\n\n==Additional images==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 01.jpg|Representing different stages of embryogenesis\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 05.jpg|Early stage of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 03.jpg|Phase of the gastrulation process\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 04.jpg|Top of the form of the embryo\nFile:Didactic model of a human embryonic development 02.jpg|Establishment of embryo medium\nFile:Sobo 1909 621.png|Spinal cord at 5 weeks\nFile:Gray947.png|Head and neck at 32 days\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Human embryos}}\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/miracle/images/stem_blastocyst.jpg Photo of blastocyst in utero]\n* Slideshow: [https://web.archive.org/web/20161222152312/http://www.lifehugger.com/doc/99/womb In the Womb]\n* [http://www.embryology.ch/indexen.html Online course in embryology] for medicine students developed by the universities of Fribourg, Lausanne and Bern\n\n{{Embryology}}\n{{Human development}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Embryogenesis}}\n[[Category:Embryology]]\n[[Category:Human biology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Human embryonic development|Embryonic development in general|Embryonic development}}\n[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|400px|The initial stages of human embryonic development]]\n{{Human growth and development}}\n'''Human embryonic development''', or '''human embryogenesis''', refers to the development and formation of the human [[embryo]]. It is characterised by the processes of [[cell division]] and [[cellular differentiation]] of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, the [[development of the human body]] entails growth from a one-celled [[zygote]] to an adult [[human being]]. [[Human fertilization|Fertilisation]] occurs when the [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]] successfully enters and [[Cell fusion|fuses]] with an [[egg cell]] (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of development commences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherk |first=Stephanie Dionne |title=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |work=Gale Encyclopedia of Children's Health, 2006 |publisher=Gale |accessdate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201081856/http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/prenatal-development |archivedate=1 December 2013 }}</ref> Embryonic development in the human, covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a [[fetus]].\n'''Human embryology''' is the study of this development during the first eight weeks after fertilisation. The normal period of [[gestation]] (pregnancy) is about nine months or 40 weeks.\n \nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] is completed in the [[uterus]]. The germinal stage takes around 10 days.<ref>{{cite web|title=germinal stage|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/germinal+stage|work=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.|publisher=Elsevier.|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. A [[blastocyst]] is then formed and implanted in the [[uterus]]. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of [[gastrulation]], when the three [[germ layers]] of the embryo form in a process called [[histogenesis]], and the processes of [[neurulation]] and [[organogenesis]] follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in [[gene expression]], [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]]. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among [[chordate]]s.\n\n== Germinal stage ==\n\n=== Fertilization ===\n{{Main|Human fertilization}}\nFertilization takes place when the [[spermatozoon]] has successfully entered the ovum and the two sets of genetic material carried by the [[gamete]]s fuse together, resulting in the zygote (a single [[diploid]] cell). This usually takes place in the ampulla of one of the [[fallopian tube]]s. The zygote contains the combined genetic material carried by both the male and female gametes which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the ovum and the 23 chromosomes from the nucleus of the sperm. The 46 chromosomes undergo changes prior to the [[mitotic division]] which leads to the formation of the embryo having two cells.\n\nSuccessful fertilization is enabled by three processes, which also act as controls to ensure species-specificity. The first is that of [[chemotaxis]] which directs the movement of the sperm towards the ovum. Secondly there is an adhesive compatibility between the sperm and the egg. With the sperm adhered to the ovum, the third process of [[acrosomal reaction]] takes place; the front part of the spermatozoan head is capped by an [[acrosome]] which contains digestive [[enzyme]]s to break down the [[zona pellucida]] and allow its entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |title=acrosome definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDPQanq?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/dictionary/DictionaryResults.aspx?refid=1861695331 |archivedate=2009-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The entry of the sperm causes calcium to be released which blocks entry to other sperm cells. A parallel reaction takes place in the ovum called the [[zona reaction]]. This sees the release of [[cortical granule]]s that release enzymes which digest sperm receptor proteins, thus preventing [[polyspermy]].  The granules also fuse with the plasma membrane and modify the zona pellucida in such a way as to prevent further sperm entry.\n\n=== Cleavage ===\n{{Further|Cleavage (embryo)}}\n[[File:Embryo, 8 cells.jpg|thumb|200px|8-cell embryo, at 3 days]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] process is marked when the zygote divides through [[mitosis]] into two cells.  This mitosis continues and the first two cells divide into four cells, then into eight cells and so on. Each division takes from 12 to 24 hours.  The zygote is large compared to any other cell and undergoes cleavage without any overall increase in size.  This means that with each successive subdivision, the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic material increases.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book|chapter=Cleavage and blastula formation|title=Biological physics of the developing embryo|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-521-78337-8|page=27|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUyVWQhk7CkC&pg=PA27|author1=Forg\u00e1cs, G.  |author2=Newman, Stuart A.}}</ref>  Initially the dividing cells, called [[blastomeres]] (''blastos'' Greek for sprout), are undifferentiated and aggregated into a sphere enclosed within the membrane of [[glycoproteins]] (termed the zona pellucida) of the ovum.

Cells differentiate into an outer layer of cells (collectively called the [[trophoblast]]) and an [[inner cell mass]]. With further compaction the individual outer blastomeres, the trophoblasts, become indistinguishable. They are still enclosed within the [[zona pellucida]]. This compaction serves to make the structure watertight, containing the fluid that the cells will later secrete. The inner mass of cells differentiate to become [[embryoblast]]s and [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarise]] at one end. They close together and form [[gap junction]]s, which facilitate cellular communication. This polarisation leaves a cavity, the [[blastocoel]], creating a structure that is now termed the blastocyst. (In animals other than mammals, this is called the [[blastula]].) The trophoblasts secrete fluid into the blastocoel. The resulting increase in size of the blastocyst causes it to [[zona hatching|hatch]] through the zona pellucida, which then disintegrates.<ref>http://www.vanat.cvm.umn.edu/TFFLectPDFs/LectEarlyEmbryo{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\nThe inner cell mass will give rise to the [[pre-embryo]],<ref name=\"opentext\">{{cite web |title=28.2 Embryonic Development \u2013 Anatomy and Physiology |url=https://opentextbc.ca/anatomyandphysiology/chapter/28-2-embryonic-development/ |website=opentextbc.ca}}</ref> the [[amnion]], [[yolk sac]] and [[allantois]], while the fetal part of the [[placenta]] will form from the outer trophoblast layer.

It becomes thickened, with its [[secretory gland]]s becoming elongated, and is increasingly [[vascular]]. This lining of the uterine cavity (or womb) is now known as the [[decidua]], and it produces a great number of large [[decidual cells]] in its increased interglandular tissue. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called [[Trophoblast]].The [[trophoblast]] then differentiates into an inner layer, the [[cytotrophoblast]], and an outer layer, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]]. The cytotrophoblast contains [[cuboidal]] [[epithelial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] and is the source of dividing cells, and the syncytiotrophoblast is a [[Syncytium|syncytial]] layer without cell boundaries.\n\nThe syncytiotrophoblast implants the blastocyst in the decidual [[epithelium]] by projections of [[chorionic villi]], forming the embryonic part of the placenta. The placenta develops once the blastocyst is implanted, connecting the embryo to the uterine wall. The decidua here is termed the decidua basalis; it lies between the blastocyst and the [[myometrium]] and forms the maternal part of the [[placenta]]. The implantation is assisted by [[hydrolytic]] [[enzyme]]s that erode the [[epithelium]]. The [[syncytiotrophoblast]] also produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] that stimulates the release of [[progesterone]] from the [[corpus luteum]]. Progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can oxygenate and sustain the developing embryo. The uterus liberates sugar from stored [[glycogen]] from its cells to nourish the [[embryo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. | authorlink= |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Waste products from the embryo will diffuse across the placenta.\n\nAs the syncytiotrophoblast starts to penetrate the uterine wall, the inner cell mass (embryoblast) also develops. The inner cell mass is the source of embryonic [[stem cells]], which are [[pluripotent]] and can develop into any one of the three germ layer cells, and which have the potency to give rise to all the tissues and organs.\n\n===Embryonic disc===\nThe embryoblast forms an [[embryonic disc]], which is a [[bilaminar blastocyst|bilaminar disc]] of two layers, an upper layer called the [[epiblast]] (primitive [[ectoderm]]) and a lower layer called the [[hypoblast]] (primitive [[endoderm]]). The disc is stretched between what will become the [[amniotic cavity]] and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the hypoblast is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The hypoblast is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some hypoblast cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an [[extracellular matrix]] along the way. These hypoblast cells and extracellular matrix are called [[Heuser's membrane]] (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the hypoblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or [[extraembryonic coelom]].\n\n==Gastrulation==\n{{Main|Gastrulation}}\n[[File:Germ layers.jpg|thumb|800px|[[Histogenesis]] of the three germ layers]]\n[[File:Ultrasound of embryo at 5 weeks, colored.png|thumb|200px|Artificially colored - [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]] and [[embryo]] (measuring 3 mm at 5 weeks)]]\n[[File:2910 The Placenta-02.jpg|420px|thumb|Embryo attached to placenta in amniotic cavity]]\n\nThe [[primitive streak]], a linear band of cells formed by the migrating epiblast, appears, and this marks the beginning of [[gastrulation]], which takes place around the seventeenth day (week 3) after fertilisation. The process of gastrulation reorganises the two-layer embryo into a three-layer embryo, and also gives the embryo its specific head-to-tail, and front-to-back orientation, by way of the primitive streak which establishes [[bilateral symmetry]]. A [[primitive node]] (or primitive knot) forms in front of the primitive streak which is the organiser of [[neurulation]]. A [[primitive pit]] forms as a depression in the centre of the primitive node which connects to the [[notochord]] which lies directly underneath. The node has arisen from epiblasts of the amniotic cavity floor, and it is this node that induces the formation of the [[neural plate]] which serves as the basis for the nervous system. The neural plate will form opposite the primitive streak from ectodermal tissue which thickens and flattens into the neural plate. The epiblast in that region moves down into the streak at the location of the primitive pit where the process called [[Ingression (biology)|ingression]], which leads to the formation of the mesoderm takes place. This ingression sees the cells from the epiblast move into the primitive streak in an [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]; epithelial cells become mesenchymal stem cells, [[multipotent]] [[stromal]] cells that can [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into various cell types. The hypoblast is pushed out of the way and goes on to form the [[amnion]]. The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The epiblast has now differentiated into the three [[germ layer]]s of the embryo, so that the bilaminar disc is now a trilaminar disc, the [[gastrula]].\n\nThe three germ layers are the [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]] and [[endoderm]], and are formed as three overlapping flat discs. It is from these three layers that all the structures and organs of the body will be derived through the processes of [[somitogenesis]], [[histogenesis]] and [[organogenesis]].<ref>Ross, Lawrence M. & Lamperti, Edward D., ed.

As in all [[deuterostome]]s, the blastopore becomes the [[anus]] whilst the gut tunnels through the embryo to the other side where the opening becomes the mouth. With a functioning digestive tube, gastrulation is now completed and the next stage of [[neurulation]] can begin.\n\n==Neurulation==\n{{Main|Neurulation}}\n[[File:Neural crest.svg|220px|thumb|left|Neural plate]]\n[[File:Embryonic Development CNS.png|thumb|280px|Neural tube development]]\nFollowing gastrulation, the ectoderm gives rise to epithelial and [[nervous tissue|neural tissue]], and the gastrula is now referred to as the [[neurula]]. The [[neural plate]] that has formed as a thickened plate from the ectoderm, continues to broaden and its ends start to fold upwards as [[neural folds]]. [[Neurulation]] refers to this folding process whereby the neural plate is transformed into the [[neural tube]], and this takes place during the fourth week. They fold, along a shallow [[neural groove]] which has formed as a dividing median line in the neural plate. This deepens as the folds continue to gain height, when they will meet and close together at the [[neural crest]]. The cells that migrate through the most cranial part of the primitive line form the [[paraxial mesoderm]], which will give rise to the [[somitomeres]] that in the process of [[somitogenesis]] will differentiate into [[somite]]s that will form the [[sclerotome]], the syndetome,<ref name=\"pmid12705871\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent AE, Schweitzer R, Tabin CJ |title=A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors |journal=Cell |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=235\u201348 |date=April 2003  |pmid=12705871 |doi= 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00268-X}}</ref> the\n[[myotome]] and the [[dermatome (embryology)|dermatome]] to form [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], [[tendon]]s, [[dermis]] (skin), and [[muscle]].

Sometimes full development, as in the lungs, continues after birth. Different organs take part in the development of the many [[organ system]]s of the body.\n\n===Blood===\n[[Haematopoietic stem cell]]s that give rise to all the [[blood cell]]s develop from the mesoderm. The development of [[haematopoiesis|blood formation]] takes place in clusters of blood cells, known as [[blood island]]s, in the [[yolk sac]]. Blood islands develop outside the embryo, on the umbilical vesicle, allantois, connecting stalk, and chorion, from mesodermal [[hemangioblast]]s.\n\nIn the centre of a blood island, hemangioblasts form the haematopoietic stem cells that are the precursor to all types of blood cell.

By day 19, following [[cell signalling]], two strands begin to form as tubes in this region, as a lumen develops within them.

This is enabled by the folding of the embryo which pushes the tubes into the [[thoracic cavity]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\">{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=W J|title=Human Embryology|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-443-06583-7|pages=170\u2013190|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nAlso at the same time that the endocardial tubes are forming, [[vasculogenesis]] (the development of the circulatory system) has begun. This starts on day 18 with cells in the splanchnopleuric mesoderm differentiating into [[angioblast]]s that develop into flattened endothelial cells. These join to form small vesicles called angiocysts which join up to form long vessels called angioblastic cords. These cords develop into a pervasive network of plexuses in the formation of the vascular network. This network grows by the additional budding and sprouting of new vessels in the process of [[angiogenesis]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/> Following vasculogenesis and the development of an early vasculature, a stage of [[vascular remodelling in the embryo|vascular remodelling]] takes place.\n\nThe tubular heart quickly forms five distinct regions. From head to tail, these are the [[infundibulum (heart)|infundibulum]], [[bulbus cordis]], [[primitive ventricle]], [[primitive atrium]], and the [[sinus venosus]].  Initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and is propelled from tail to head to the [[truncus arteriosus]]. This will divide to form the [[aorta]] and [[pulmonary artery]]; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right (primitive) ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right [[atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[sinoatrial node]] and the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\"Anatomy & physiology\"/>\n\nCardiac looping begins to shape the heart as one of the processes of [[morphogenesis]], and this completes by the end of the fourth week. [[Programmed cell death]] ([[apoptosis]]) at the joining surfaces enables fusion to take place.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\nIn the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives blood from the three major veins: the [[vitelline vein|vitelline]], the [[umbilical vein|umbilical]] and the [[common cardinal vein]]s.\n\nDuring the first two months of development, the [[interatrial septum]] begins to form. This septum divides the [[primitive atrium]] into a right and a left [[atrium (heart)|atrium]]. Firstly it starts as a crescent-shaped piece of tissue which grows downwards as the [[septum primum]]. The crescent shape prevents the complete closure of the atria allowing blood to be shunted from the right to the left atrium through the opening known as the [[ostium primum]]. This closes with further development of the system but before it does, a second opening (the [[ostium secundum]]) begins to form in the upper atrium enabling the continued shunting of blood.<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\nA second septum (the [[septum secundum]]) begins to form to the right of the septum primum. This also leaves a small opening, the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] which is continuous with the previous opening of the ostium secundum. The septum primum is reduced to a small flap that acts as the valve of the foramen ovale and this remains until its closure at birth. Between the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]]\nthe [[intraventricular septum|septum inferius]] also forms which develops into the muscular [[interventricular septum]].<ref name=\"Human Embryology\"/>\n\n===Digestive system===\n{{Main |Development of the digestive system}}\nThe digestive system starts to develop from the third week and by the twelfth week, the organs have correctly positioned themselves.\n\n=== Respiratory system ===\nThe respiratory system develops from the [[lung bud]], which appears in the ventral wall of the foregut about four weeks into development. The lung bud forms the trachea and two lateral growths known as the bronchial buds, which enlarge at the beginning of the fifth week to form the left and right main [[Bronchus|bronchi]]. These bronchi in turn form secondary (lobar) bronchi; three on the right and two on the left (reflecting the number of lung lobes). Tertiary bronchi form from secondary bronchi.\n\nWhile the internal lining of the [[larynx]] originates from the [[lung bud]], its cartilages and muscles originate from the fourth and sixth [[pharyngeal arch]]es.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Langman's medical embryology.|last=W.)|first=Sadler, T.

The ectoderm divides to form a flat layer of cells on the surface known as the periderm. Further division forms the individual [[Epidermis#Layers|layers of the epidermis]].\n\nThe mesenchyme that will form the dermis is derived from three sources:\n\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the limbs and body wall derives from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the back derives from [[paraxial mesoderm]]\n* The mesenchyme that forms the dermis in the face and neck derives from [[Neural crest|neural crest cells]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Nervous system===\n{{Main|Development of the nervous system in humans |Development of the human brain}}\n[[File:Human embryo 8 weeks 4.JPG|thumb|240px|Development of brain in 8 week old embryo]]\nLate in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube bends ventrally as the [[Flexure (embryology)|cephalic flexure]] at the level of the future [[midbrain]]\u2014the [[mesencephalon]].

These placodes [[Invagination|invaginate]] to form [[otic pit]]s, and then [[otic vesicle]]s. The otic vesicles then form ventral and dorsal components.\n\nThe ventral component forms the [[saccule]] and the [[cochlear duct]]. In the sixth week of development the cochlear duct emerges and penetrates the surrounding [[mesenchyme]], travelling in a spiral shape until it forms 2.5 turns by the end of the eighth week. The saccule is the remaining part of the ventral component. It remains connected to the cochlear duct via the narrow [[ductus reuniens]].\n\nThe dorsal component forms the [[Utricle (ear)|utricle]] and [[semicircular canals]].\n\n==== Middle ear ====\nThe [[tympanic cavity]] and [[eustachian tube]] are derived from the [[Pharyngeal pouch (embryology)#First pouch|first pharyngeal pouch]] (a cavity lined by [[endoderm]]). The distal part of the cleft, the tubotympanic recess, widens to create the tympanic cavity. The proximal part of the cleft remains narrow and creates the eustachian tube.\n\nThe [[bone]]s of the middle ear, the [[ossicles]], derive from the cartilages of the [[pharyngeal arch]]es. The [[malleus]] and [[incus]] derive from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#First arch|first pharyngeal arch]], whereas the [[stapes]] derives from the cartilage of the [[Pharyngeal arch#Second arch|second pharyngeal arch]].\n\n==== Outer ear ====\nThe [[Ear canal|external auditory meatus]] develops from the dorsal portion of the first [[Pharyngeal groove|pharyngeal cleft]].

This [[cell potency]] means that some cells can be removed from the preimplantation embryo and the remaining cells will compensate for their absence. This has allowed the development of a technique known as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]], whereby a small number of cells from the preimplantation embryo created by [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]], can be removed by [[biopsy]] and subjected to genetic diagnosis.

[[Kingston upon Hull]] is Yorkshire's largest port and has a large manufacturing base, its fishing industry has however declined somewhat in recent years.  [[Harrogate]] and [[Knaresborough]] both have small legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and [[Harrogate International Centre]] in the town.\n\nCoal mining was extremely active in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around [[Barnsley]] and [[Wakefield]]. As late as the 1970s, the number of miners working in the area was still in six figures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/sense_of_place/miners/miners_state_of_the_industry.shtml |title=BBC \u2013 Bradford and West Yorkshire \u2013 A Sense of Place \u2013 Coal mining in West Yorkshire: The end of an era |accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> The industry was placed under threat on 6 March 1984 when the [[National Coal Board]] announced the closure of 20 pits nationwide (some of them in South Yorkshire).

There are also a number of innovation centres belonging to leading companies, and a range of spin-off companies linked to major universities.\n\nMany large British companies are based in Yorkshire or were founded there. These include [[HSBC]] (Sheffield), [[Morrisons]] (Bradford), [[Asda]] (Leeds), [[Jet2.com]] (Leeds), [[Ronseal]] (Sheffield), [[Optare]] (Leeds), [[Aunt Bessie's]] (Hull), [[Birds Eye]] (Hull), [[Wharfedale (company)|Wharfedale]] (Leeds), [[Plaxton]] (Scarborough), [[Seven Seas (company)|Seven Seas]] (Hull), [[Little Chef]] (Sheffield), [[Plusnet]] (Sheffield), Quidco (Sheffield), [[Fenner plc]] (Hull), [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax Bank]] (Halifax), [[Rank Organisation]] (Hull), [[Yorkshire Bank]] (Leeds), [[William Jackson Food Group]] (Hull), [[Yorkshire Building Society]] (Bradford), [[Ebuyer]] (Howden), [[Good Hair Day|GHD]] (Leeds), [[Marks and Spencer]] (Leeds), [[Burton (clothing)|Burton]]s (Leeds), [[Jaeger (clothing)|Jaeger]] (Ilkley), [[Magnet Kitchens]] (Keighley), [[Reckitt and Sons]] (Hull), [[McCains]] (Scarborough), [[First Direct]] (Leeds), [[KCOM Group]] (Hull), [[Tetley's Brewery]] (Leeds), [[Timothy Taylor Brewery]] (Keighley), [[Bradford and Bingley]] (Bingley), [[Skipton Building Society]] (Skipton), [[Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate]], SGS Europe (Hull) and [[Provident Financial]] ([[Bradford]]).\n\n==Education==\nYorkshire has a large base of primary and secondary schools operated by both local authorities and private bodies, and a dozen universities, along with a wide range of colleges and further education facilities. Four universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield (the last with branches in Barnsley and Oldham). The largest universities by enrolment are [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Leeds]], each with over 31,000 students, followed by [[Leeds Beckett University]], and the most recent to attain university status is the [[Leeds Arts University]]. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the [[Open University]] and Britain's first for-profit university (since 2012), the [[University of Law]].

In the early twentieth century, [[F. W.

As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, ''[[Beowulf]]'', believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today.<ref name=\"moorman\" /> One of Moorman's students at Leeds University, [[Herbert Read]], was greatly influenced by Moorman's ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains.

This resulted in an anonymous pamphlet being published in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.<ref>Anonymous pamphlet, Thoughts on national independence, suggested by Mr. Pitt's speeches on the Irish union by a member of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, (London: Printed Privately, 1799), pp.25\u201327</ref>\n\nAlthough in the devolution debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referenda on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] Member of Parliament for Hamilton, [[Winifred Ewing]]. Ewing argued that it was offensive to Scots to argue that an English region had the same status as an 'ancient nation' such as Scotland.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 14 February 1969, vol. 777, cc1725-76</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Yorkshire and Scottish devolution was again made in 1975 by Richard Wainwright, MP for Colne Valley, who claimed in a speech in the House of Commons:\n\n{{quote|The nationalist movement in Scotland is associated with flags, strange costumes, weird music and extravagant ceremonial.

Most of the county falls within [[Yorkshire and the Humber]]. The extreme northern part of the county, such as [[Middlesbrough]], [[Redcar]], [[Holwick]] and [[Startforth]], fall within [[North East England]]. Small areas in the west of the historic county, like [[Saddleworth]], [[Barnoldswick]] and [[Sedbergh]], fall within [[North West England]]. During these processes the geographical or historic boundaries of Yorkshire remained unchanged.\n\nWithin the regions are both ceremonial counties, and the actual units of local government, such as unitary authorities, as detailed at [[Yorkshire and the Humber#Local government|Local government divisions of Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[North East England#Local government|Local government divisions of North East England]] and [[North West England#Local government|Local government divisions of North West England]].\n\n==Economy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n[[File:Bridgewater Place from Call Lane.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Bridgewater Place]], a symbol of Leeds' growing financial importance.]]\nYorkshire has a mixed economy, and accounts for about 8% of UK GDP.

[[Harrogate]] and [[Knaresborough]] both have small legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and [[Harrogate International Centre]] in the town.\n\nCoal mining was extremely active in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around [[Barnsley]] and [[Wakefield]].

Four universities are based in Leeds, two in Sheffield, two in York, and one each in Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough and Huddersfield (the last with branches in Barnsley and Oldham). The largest universities by enrolment are [[Sheffield Hallam University]] and the [[University of Leeds]], each with over 31,000 students, followed by [[Leeds Beckett University]], and the most recent to attain university status is the [[Leeds Arts University]]. There are also branches of institutions headquartered in other parts of England, such as the [[Open University]] and Britain's first for-profit university (since 2012), the [[University of Law]].

The [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region of [[Government Office]] covers most, but not all of the [[Historic counties of England|historic]] county.\n\n===Distinctive identity and devolution campaigns===\n\nA number of claims have been made for the distinctiveness of Yorkshire, as a geographical, cultural and political entity, and these have been used to demand increased political autonomy. In the early twentieth century, [[F. W. Moorman]], the first professor of English Language at [[Leeds University]], claimed Yorkshire was not settled by [[Angles]] or [[Saxons]] following the end of Roman rule in Britain, but by a different Germanic tribe, the [[Geats]]. As a consequence, he claimed, it is possible the first work of English literature, ''[[Beowulf]]'', believed to have been composed by Geats, was written in Yorkshire, and this distinctive ethnic and cultural origin is the root of the unique status of Yorkshire today.<ref name=\"moorman\" /> One of Moorman's students at Leeds University, [[Herbert Read]], was greatly influenced by Moorman's ideas on Yorkshire identity, and claimed that until recent times Yorkshire was effectively an island, cut off from the rest of England by rivers, fens, moors and mountains. This distancing of Yorkshire from England led Read to question whether Yorkshire people were really English at all.<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite news |first=Herbert |last=Read |title=Review of Frederic Richard Pearson, ''Yorkshire'' |newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement |date=31 January 1929 |page=79}}</ref> Combined with the suggested ethnic difference to the rest of England, Read quoted Frederic Pearson, who wrote:\n\n{{quote|There is something characteristic about the very physiognomy of the Yorkshireman. He is much more of a Dane or a Viking than a Saxon. He is usually a big upstanding man, who looks as if he could take care of himself and those who depend upon him in an emergency. This is indeed the character that his neighbours give him; the southerner may think him a little hard: but if ever our country is let down by its inhabitants, we may be sure that it will not be the fault of Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/>}}\n\nDuring the premiership of [[William Pitt the Younger]] the hypothetical idea of Yorkshire becoming independent was raised in the British parliament in relation to the question whether Ireland should become part of the [[Acts of Union 1800|United Kingdom]]. This resulted in an anonymous pamphlet being published in London in 1799 arguing at length that Yorkshire could never be an independent state as it would always be reliant on the rest of the United Kingdom to provide it with essential resources.<ref>Anonymous pamphlet, Thoughts on national independence, suggested by Mr. Pitt's speeches on the Irish union by a member of the honourable society of Lincoln's Inn, (London: Printed Privately, 1799), pp.25\u201327</ref>\n\nAlthough in the devolution debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the late 1960s, which paved the way for the 1979 referenda on the creation of a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, parallel devolution for Yorkshire was suggested, this was opposed by the [[Scottish National Party]] Member of Parliament for Hamilton, [[Winifred Ewing]]. Ewing argued that it was offensive to Scots to argue that an English region had the same status as an 'ancient nation' such as Scotland.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 14 February 1969, vol. 777, cc1725-76</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Yorkshire and Scottish devolution was again made in 1975 by Richard Wainwright, MP for Colne Valley, who claimed in a speech in the House of Commons:\n\n{{quote|The nationalist movement in Scotland is associated with flags, strange costumes, weird music and extravagant ceremonial. When... people go to Yorkshire and find that we have no time for dressing up, waving flags and playing strange instruments\u2014in other words, we are not a lot of Presbyterians in Yorkshire\u2014they should not assume that we do not have the same feelings underneath the skin. Independence in Yorkshire expresses itself in a markedly increasing determination to establish self-reliance.<ref>Hansard Parliamentary Papers, HC Deb, 18 December 1975, vol. 902, cc1832-52</ref>}}\n\nIn more recent years, in 1998 the Campaign for Yorkshire was established to push for the creation of a Yorkshire regional assembly,<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Hazell |title=The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom |location=London |publisher=Imprint Academic |date=2000 |page=118}}</ref> sometimes dubbed the Yorkshire Parliament.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where there's muck |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 March 1999 |page=3}}</ref> In its defining statement, the Campaign for Yorkshire made reference to the historical notions that Yorkshire had a distinctive identity:\n\n{{quote|Yorkshire and the Humber has distinctive characteristics which make it an ideal test bed for further reform. It has a strong popular identity. The region follows closely the historic boundaries of the three Ridings, and there is no serious debate about boundaries. It possesses strong existing regional partnerships including universities, voluntary and church associations. All this makes it realistic to regard Yorkshire and the Humber as the standard bearer for representative regional government.<ref>Campaign for Yorkshire literature, quoted in Robert Hazell, ''The State and the Nations: The First Year of Devolution in the United Kingdom'' (London: Imprint Academic, 2000) p.140</ref>}}\n\nThe Campaign for Yorkshire was led by Jane Thomas as Director<ref>{{cite news |title=New Director for Campaign Group |newspaper=Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph |date=13 October 1999 |page=5}}</ref> and Paul Jagger as chairman.

In September 2013, the Executive Committee was joined by Richard Honnoraty and Richard Carter (as an advisor), who had also been involved in the Campaign for Yorkshire.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf. [[Donovan]] was keen on Merry, and they wanted [[Twiggy]] for Galadriel and \"a lot of other people\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/sd-me-music-beatles-lord-of-the-rings-20180731-story.html|title=Help!

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' around that time) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the United States. Lester Abrams sent Rankin 20 character designs after Rankin and Bass liked his work on an excerpt of Tolkien's for ''Children's Digest'' at the time.

While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe television special received mixed reactions. In 1978, [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref name=\":35\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with ''The Lord of the Rings'', leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson insisted to make two films (and even suggested three<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":27\" />) and the Weinsteins \"blanched\"<ref name=\":35\" /> but agreed on two films. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made remarks about potential spinoff films<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19958.php|title=20 QUESTIONS WITH PETER JACKSON - PART 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and even half-joking remarks about television spin-off shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, but his agent Ken Kamins convinced Harvey Weinstein that getting another filmmaker to work on the project will result in further delays and costs, at which point Harvey conceded to give Jackson the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf. [[Donovan]] was keen on Merry, and they wanted [[Twiggy]] for Galadriel and \"a lot of other people\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/sd-me-music-beatles-lord-of-the-rings-20180731-story.html|title=Help!

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' around that time) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made half-joking remarks about television spin-off shows<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref> and films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19958.php|title=20 QUESTIONS WITH PETER JACKSON - PART 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, but his agent Ken Kamins convinced Harvey Weinstein that getting another filmmaker to work on the project will result in further delays and costs, at which point Harvey conceded to give Jackson the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success.

Gaffer [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies and stunt coordinator [[Glen Boswall]] replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]], who worked on Rings. Visual effects were again managed by [[Weta Digital]], but [[Joe Letteri]] (a Rings veteran) replaced [[Jim Rygiel]] as animation supervisor. \n\nFollowing the release of ''The Battle of the Five Armies'', Freeman reprised his role as Bilbo Baggins in the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch known interchangeably either as ''The Office: Middle Earth'' or ''The Hobbit Office'', alongside [[Bobby Moynihan]], [[Taran Killam]], [[Kyle Mooney]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as Gandalf, Gollum, Legolas and Tauriel respectively as they take up office jobs. The skit explains that during the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tauriel remained working at this office. The skit is based on the fact that Freeman starred in the [[The Office (U.K. TV series)|British series of ''The Office'']] as [[Tim Canterbury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg8NS6s0fkw|title=Hobbit Office - SNL|date=December 14, 2014|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n===Crew===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\"| Crew\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peter Jackson's films\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n|-\n!
