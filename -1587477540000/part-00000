He was the son of farmer Henry Pitman and Sarah (n\u00e9e Marchant) Pitman. After his father's death in 1880, his mother remarried, to Charles Candy. In 1881, a census shows Herbert Pitman was living on a {{convert|112|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} farm on Sutton Road with his brother, sister, and widowed mother.\n\n==Sea career==\nPitman first went to sea in 1895 at the age of 18 after joining the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. He received the shore part of his nautical training in the Navigation Department of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers|Merchant Venturers' Technical College]], under Mr. E. F. White, and qualified as a [[Master mariner#United Kingdom|Master Mariner]] in August 1906. He served a four-year apprenticeship with [[Nourse Line|James Nourse Ltd]]. followed by five years as a Deck Officer. From 1904, he served one year as a Deck Officer with the [[Blue Anchor Line]] before moving to the Shire Line, with whom he served for six months. He moved to the [[White Star Line]] in 1906. While employed with White Star, he served as Fourth, Third and [[Second Officer (nautical)|Second Officer]] on the vessels ''Dolphin'' and ''Majestic'', and as Fourth Officer on the ''Oceanic''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==R.M.S. ''Titanic''==\nLike the other junior officers Pitman received a telegram early in 1912 directing him to report to White Star's [[Liverpool]] office at nine in the morning on 26 March of that year. There he collected his ticket for [[Belfast]]; he arrived there at noon the following day and reported to (then) Chief Officer [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]]. As the ''Titanic'' departed [[Southampton]] on 10 April, Pitman was assisting (now First) Officer Murdoch at the stern of the ship in supervising the casting-off of mooring ropes and taking on of tug lines. While the ''Titanic'' was at sea, Pitman's duties included working out celestial observation and compass deviation, general supervision of the decks, looking to the quartermasters, and relieving the bridge officers when necessary.\n\nAt the time of the ''Titanic''{{'}}s collision with the iceberg, Pitman was off-duty, half-asleep in his bunk in the Officers' Quarters. He heard and felt the collision, later testifying that it felt like the ship \"coming to an anchor.\" He was dressing for his watch when Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall|Boxhall]] rushed in and informed him they had struck an iceberg and were taking on water. Pitman was then ordered to report to the starboard side of the ship to assist in uncovering lifeboats. After receiving the command to lower the boats, Murdoch ordered Pitman to take charge of [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 5 (starboard)|Lifeboat No. 5]]. Before Pitman entered the lifeboat, Murdoch shook his hand saying \"Goodbye; good luck.\" Pitman at this point did not believe that the ''Titanic'' was seriously endangered, and thought the evacuation of passengers was precautionary. He stepped into the lifeboat and it was lowered to the water. Murdoch had ordered Pitman to take the lightly loaded lifeboat to the gangway doors to take on more passengers there, but (as Pitman later testified) the doors failed to open as the lifeboat waited for this about 100 yards off from the ship.<ref>Pitman H. [http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq13Pitman01.php Testimony, Question 15004 et seq.] at British Wreck Commission enquiry transcript</ref>\n\nUp to this point Pitman had expected the ship to remain afloat. After an hour in the lifeboat however, he realised that ''Titanic'' was doomed, and withdrew the lifeboat 300 yards further off from the descending ship. He watched ''Titanic'' sink from about 400 yards distance, and was one of the few to state afterwards in the official enquiries that he thought she sank in one piece. As the stern slipped under water, he looked at his watch and announced to the lifeboat's occupants, \"It's 2.20,\". Hearing the cries of those in the water after the ship had gone, Pitman decided to row back to them to rescue whomever he could. However, after announcing this course of action to the passengers in the lifeboat he was confronted with voluble protests from amongst them against the idea, with the expression of fear that the lifeboat would be mobbed and capsized by the panicking multitude in the water. Faced with this Pitman acquiesced and kept the lifeboat at its station several hundred yards off whilst the passengers and crew in the water perished swiftly in the cold. (In later life Pitman admitted to bearing the burden of a bad conscience for his failure to take the lifeboat to the rescue of those dying in the water that night). \n\n[[File:Lightoller and Pitman.jpg|thumb|right|Pitman (left) with 2nd officer [[Charles Lightoller]] (right).]]\n\nLifeboat No. 5 was picked up by the next morning by the rescue ship ''{{RMS|Carpathia}}'' along with the other survivors from the sinking, and Pitman arrived at Pier 54 in [[New York City]] with the rest of the survivors on 18 April 1912. While in New York he testified as a witness in the American Government's inquiry into the sinking. He and his fellow surviving officers left New York City on the ''Adriatic'' on 2 May 1912. On returning home to England, he testified as a witness to the sinking for a second time before a British Governmental inquiry.\n\n==Later years==\nPitman continued to serve with the White Star Line following the ''Titanic'' disaster.

In the early 1920s, he moved from White Star to Shaw, Savill and Albion Company Ltd. and also took a wife in 1922 \u2013 Mildred \"Mimi\" Kalman from New Zealand. During the Second World War, he served as purser on board the {{Interlanguage link multi|SS Mataroa{{!}}SS ''Mataroa''|fr|3=Mataroa}}, and finally retired in the spring of 1946 after over fifty years at sea.

He was the son of farmer Henry Pitman and Sarah (n\u00e9e Marchant) Pitman. After his father's death in 1880, his mother remarried, to Charles Candy. In 1881, a census shows Herbert Pitman was living on a {{convert|112|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} farm on Sutton Road with his brother, sister, and widowed mother.\n\n==Sea career==\nPitman first went to sea in 1895 at the age of 18 after joining the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]]. He received the shore part of his nautical training in the Navigation Department of the [[Society of Merchant Venturers|Merchant Venturers' Technical College]], under Mr. E. F. White, and qualified as a [[Master mariner#United Kingdom|Master Mariner]] in August 1906. He served a four-year apprenticeship with [[Nourse Line|James Nourse Ltd]]. followed by five years as a Deck Officer. From 1904, he served one year as a Deck Officer with the [[Blue Anchor Line]] before moving to the Shire Line, with whom he served for six months. He moved to the [[White Star Line]] in 1906. While employed with White Star, he served as Fourth, Third and [[Second Officer (nautical)|Second Officer]] on the vessels ''Dolphin'' and ''Majestic'', and as Fourth Officer on the ''Oceanic''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==R.M.S. ''Titanic''==\nLike the other junior officers Pitman received a telegram early in 1912 directing him to report to White Star's [[Liverpool]] office at nine in the morning on 26 March of that year. There he collected his ticket for [[Belfast]]; he arrived there at noon the following day and reported to (then) Chief Officer [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]]. As the ''Titanic'' departed [[Southampton]] on 10 April, Pitman was assisting (now First) Officer Murdoch at the stern of the ship in supervising the casting-off of mooring ropes and taking on of tug lines. While the ''Titanic'' was at sea, Pitman's duties included working out celestial observation and compass deviation, general supervision of the decks, looking to the quartermasters, and relieving the bridge officers when necessary.\n\nAt the time of the Titanic's collision with the iceberg, Pitman was off-duty, half-asleep in his bunk in the Officers' Quarters. He heard and felt the collision, later testifying that it felt like the ship \"coming to an anchor.\" He was dressing for his watch when Fourth Officer [[Joseph Boxhall|Boxhall]] rushed in and informed him they had struck an iceberg and were taking on water. Pitman was then ordered to report to the starboard side of the ship to assist in uncovering lifeboats. After receiving the command to lower the boats, Murdoch ordered Pitman to take charge of [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 5 (starboard)|Lifeboat No. 5]]. Before Pitman entered the lifeboat, Murdoch shook his hand saying \"Goodbye; good luck.\" Pitman at this point did not believe that the ''Titanic'' was seriously endangered, and thought the evacuation of passengers was precautionary. He stepped into the lifeboat and it was lowered to the water. Murdoch had ordered Pitman to take the lightly loaded lifeboat to the gangway doors to take on more passengers there, but (as Pitman later testified) the doors failed to open as the lifeboat waited for this about 100 yards off from the ship.<ref>Pitman H. [http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq13Pitman01.php Testimony, Question 15004 et seq.] at British Wreck Commission enquiry transcript</ref>\n\nUp to this point Pitman had expected the ship to remain afloat. After an hour in the lifeboat however, he realised that ''Titanic'' was doomed, and withdrew the lifeboat 300 yards further off from the descending ship. He watched ''Titanic'' sink from about 400 yards distance, and was one of the few to state afterwards in the official enquiries that he thought she sank in one piece. As the stern slipped under water, he looked at his watch and announced to the lifeboat's occupants, \"It's 2.20,\". Hearing the cries of those in the water after the ship had gone, Pitman decided to row back to them to rescue whomever he could. However, after announcing this course of action to the passengers in the lifeboat he was confronted with voluble protests from amongst them against the idea, with the expression of fear that the lifeboat would be mobbed and capsized by the panicking multitude in the water. Faced with this Pitman acquiesced and kept the lifeboat at its station several hundred yards off whilst the passengers and crew in the water perished swiftly in the cold. (In later life Pitman admitted to bearing the burden of a bad conscience for his failure to take the lifeboat to the rescue of those dying in the water that night). \n\n[[File:Lightoller and Pitman.jpg|thumb|right|Pitman (left) with 2nd officer [[Charles Lightoller]] (right).]]\nLifeboat No. 5 was picked up by the next morning by the rescue ship ''{{RMS|Carpathia}}'' along with the other survivors from the sinking, and Pitman arrived at Pier 54 in [[New York City]] with the rest of the survivors on 18 April 1912.

Thereafter it became a busy junction, with many passenger trains calling to detach through carriages for Carnforth from the main Morecambe portion if heading west or attaching them if heading east - a bay platform was provided at the east end of the station for this purpose, along with several sidings on the opposite side of the line for locomotive and carriage stabling (all since removed, along with the extra platform line). A number of local services (mainly from the Carnforth line) also originated or terminated there.\n\nMuch of this activity ended with the withdrawal of local stopping trains on the Carnforth line in 1960 (though it remained in use for through services) and the closure of the Lancaster line to passengers in January 1966.<ref>Binns, p.42</ref> The latter was then closed to all traffic the following year and subsequently lifted, although the abandoned trackbed can still be seen. The original station buildings have also been demolished and replaced by shelters, although the [[signal box]] remained in use as the last remaining block post on the line until 1988 \u2013 it was then closed & permanently \"switched out\" but was not formally abolished and removed until 2006.\n\nThe junction was the site of a [[Wennington Junction rail crash|derailment on 11 August 1880]] in which eight people were killed.<ref>[[L.T.C.
