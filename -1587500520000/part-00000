Suspended beneath is a [[Gondola (balloon)|gondola]] or [[wicker|wicker basket]] (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid [[propane]]. The heated air inside the envelope makes it [[buoyant]] since it has a [[ideal gas law|lower density]] than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all [[aircraft]], hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the [[atmosphere]]. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope there is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from [[nylon]] fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as [[Nomex]]. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\n\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying [[flight]] technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Laurent d'Arlandes]] on November 21, 1783, in [[Paris]], [[France]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Lighter Than Air|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8018-9127-4|author=Tom D.

Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \"burner\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by [[propane]], a [[Liquefied petroleum gas|liquefied gas]] stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure [[Forklift truck|forklift]] [[Gas cylinder|cylinders]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pilotoutlook.com/balloon_flying/balloon_propane_tanks |title=Balloon Propane Tanks |publisher=Pilot Outlook |quote=Propane tanks used in hot air balloons are mainly constructed of either aluminum (Evan was here) he was the first to do this or stainless steel.

This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\n\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape).

Other methods include a ''flat lap'' seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a ''zigzag'', where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.<ref name=madehow/>\n\n====Coatings====\n[[File:Ballooning Away in Maasai Mara.jpg|thumb|Hot air balloon safari in [[Maasai Mara]].|left]]The fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as [[silicone]] or [[polyurethane]], to make it impermeable to air.<ref name=\"Cameron\"/> It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too [[Porosity|porous]] to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.<ref name=\"MidAtlantic\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotairrepair.com/recoating/\n| title = Mid-Atlantic Balloon Repair: Balloon Envelope Fabric Recoating\n| accessdate = 2007-03-07}}</ref>\n\n====Sizes and capacity====\nA range of envelope sizes is available.

Some hot air balloons have ''turning vents'', which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.avianballoon.com/envelope.html\n| title = Avian Balloon Corporation: The Avian Envelope\n| accessdate = 2009-06-18}}</ref>\n\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a ''parachute vent'', invented by Tracy Barnes.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.ballooninghistory.com/barnes/\n| title = The early years of sport ballooning\n| publisher = David M. Wesner\n| accessdate = 2010-06-09}}</ref> The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \"vent lines\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a [[parachute]]\u2014thus the name.) These \"vent lines\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\n\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \"[[Velcro]]-style\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \"vent lines\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \"hook and loop\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \"maneuvering vent\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon.  Another common type of top design is the \"Smart Vent,\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \"parachute\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening.  This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \"pop top\" and \"MultiVent\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\n\n====Shape====\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \"inverted tear drop\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on top of a truncated [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential [[Stress (physics)|stress]] on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \"natural\".<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.myairship.com/building/design.html\n| title = Airship and Blimp Resources: Balloon Envelope Design\n| accessdate = 2008-05-05}}</ref> Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize [[aerodynamic drag]] (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.balloonlife.com/2005/Aug-Sep05/racers.pdf\n| title = What\u2019s the Skinny on Racing Balloons?\n| accessdate = 2008-05-05\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313143144/http://www.balloonlife.com/2005/Aug-Sep05/racers.pdf\n| archive-date = 2012-03-13\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Basket===\n[[File:Hot Air Balloon Basket in Flight.jpg|thumb|right|Hot air balloon basket in flight]]\n[[File:wicker.balloon.basket.bath.arp.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Wicker|wicker basket]] capable of holding 16 passengers.]]\nBaskets are commonly made of [[Basket weaving|woven]] [[wicker]] or [[rattan]].

The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a [[pilot light]] to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a [[flint]] striker or a [[lighter]], or with a built-in [[Piezoelectricity|piezo electric]] spark.<ref name=\"LindstrandFuel\">{{cite web\n| url = http://lindstrand.com/?id=14\n| title = Lindstrand Fuel System: Burners & Tanks\n| accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref>\n\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a [[gimbal]] to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a '''whisper burner''' and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\n\n===Fuel tanks===\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical [[pressure vessel]]s made from [[aluminium]], [[stainless steel]], or [[titanium]] with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a [[fuel gauge]] and a [[Pressure measurement|pressure gauge]].

The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by [[Buoyancy#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes' principle]]. The amount of lift (or [[buoyancy]]) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120&nbsp;\u00b0C (250&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/d7a71e4def72db7e862573e900555227/$FILE/A33CE.pdf\n| title = Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Type certificate data sheet no. A33CE\n| accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nThe melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum [[operating temperature]] \u2014 about 230&nbsp;\u00b0C (450&nbsp;\u00b0F) \u2014 but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120&nbsp;\u00b0C (250&nbsp;\u00b0F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\n\nThe lift generated by 100,000&nbsp;ft\u00b3 (2831.7&nbsp;m\u00b3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! air temperature\n! air density\n! air mass\n! lift generated\n|-\n| 68&nbsp;\u00b0F, 20&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 1.2041&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 7517&nbsp;lb, 3409.7&nbsp;kg\n| 0&nbsp;lb, 0&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| 210&nbsp;\u00b0F, 99&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 0.9486&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 5922&nbsp;lb, 2686.2&nbsp;kg\n| 1595&nbsp;lb, 723.5&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| 250&nbsp;\u00b0F, 120&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 0.8978&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 5606&nbsp;lb, 2542.4&nbsp;kg\n| 1912&nbsp;lb, 867.3&nbsp;kg\n|}\n\nThe [[density of air]] at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, 68&nbsp;\u00b0F is about 1.2&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000&nbsp;ft\u00b3 heated to  (99&nbsp;\u00b0C, 210&nbsp;\u00b0F) would be 1595&nbsp;lb, 723.5&nbsp;kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\n\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20&nbsp;\u00b0C, 68&nbsp;\u00b0F), a hot air balloon heated to (99&nbsp;\u00b0C, 210&nbsp;\u00b0F) requires about 3.91&nbsp;m\u00b3 of envelope volume to lift 1&nbsp;kilogram (62.5&nbsp;ft\u00b3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000&nbsp;meters (1% per 1,000&nbsp;ft) of altitude gained.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.overflite.com/thermo.html\n|title = How to Calculate the Weight of Air and Model Hot Air Balloon Lift\n|accessdate = 2008-01-01}}</ref>\n\n====Montgolfier====\n[[File:Virgin Hot Air Balloon.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Virgin Balloon Flights|Virgin hot air balloon]] flying over [[Cambridge]].]]\nStandard hot air balloons are known as '''Montgolfier balloons''' and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/38360/1/05-1506.pdf \n |title=NASA: Montgolfiere balloon missions for Mars and Titan \n |accessdate=2008-06-04 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624220609/http://marstech.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Jones_MontgolfiereBalloons_Inte.pdf \n |archivedate=2008-06-24 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> This style of balloon was developed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]], and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&pg=PA177&dq=montgolfier+brothers+1783&client=firefox-a ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries''], p 177, Rodney P.

[[Hydrogen]] gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the danger of introducing an open flame near the gas.  All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a [[lifting gas]].<ref name=\"Amsbaugh\">{{cite web\n| url = http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/directline/dl9_balloon.htm\n| title = Balloon Incidents\n| last = Amsbaugh\n| first = Allen\n| accessdate = 2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\n====Solar====\n[[Image:Solarballon Hot 18 Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|A 4 meters high solar balloon floating over a meadow.]]\n[[Solar balloon]]s are hot air balloons that use just [[Solar power#Solar thermal|solar energy]] captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.<ref name=\"Solar\">{{cite web\n| url = http://perso.orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-index.htm\n| title = Solar Balloons\n| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Steering===\nHot air balloon can be steered to a limited degree by changing the altitude of the flight. Wind in the northern hemisphere tends to turn right due to [[coriolis effect]] as the altitude increases.\n\n==Safety equipment==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\n\n===In the basket===\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\n\nA [[fire extinguisher]] suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 &nbsp;kg [[Fire classes|AB:E]] type fire extinguisher.\n\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20\u201330 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\n\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\n\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\n\n===On the occupants===\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as [[nomex]]) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[hemp]], or [[wool]], or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity.  Most engineered fibers (with the exception of [[rayon]], which is also safe to wear) are [[thermoplastic]]; many are also [[hydrocarbons]].  This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels.  Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable.  Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\n\n===On the ground crew===\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\n\n==Maintenance and repair==\n[[File:Balloonreflection.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Taken from the basket, the reflection of the balloon can be seen in the lake below. Obstacles in the landscape can inhibit smooth retrieval of the balloon upon landing.]]\n\n[[File:2015 Birds In Hand Balloons 02 image FRD.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A commercial balloon ride approaching its landing site at [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania]]]]\n\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\n\n===Maintenance===\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\n\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\n\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.brisbanehotairballooning.com.au/ballooning-basics/\n| title = Ballooning Basics\n| accessdate = 2019-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Repair===\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\n\n==Licensing==\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\n\n===Balloons===\n[[File:Setting up hot air balloon, Poughkeepsie, NY 2.JPG|right|thumb|Top of balloon during inflation. [[Crew]] is securing parachute vent.]]\nAs with other aircraft in the US, balloons must be registered (have an [[Aircraft registration|N-number]]), have an [[airworthiness]] certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155&nbsp;pounds or 70&nbsp;kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight aircraft]].\n\n===Pilots===\n\n====In Australia====\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.abf.net.au/\n| title = Australian Ballooning Federation\n| accessdate = 2015-03-28}}</ref>\nand typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotair.com.au/pages/FAQs.html#faq15\n| title = Hot Air FAQ: What regulations are in Place?\n| accessdate = 2009-06-22\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100110215940/http://www.hotair.com.au/pages/FAQs.html#faq15\n| archive-date = 2010-01-10\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n====In the UK====\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=how can pilot have copy of license not held?}} For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\n\n====In the United States====\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a [[Pilot certification in the United States|pilot certificate]] from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \"Lighter-than-air free balloon\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight]] aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\n\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some [[Hot air balloon festivals|balloon festivals]]), a pilot must have a [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot certificate]]. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon [[flight instructor]]s. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.<ref name=\"Professional Pilots\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotairballooning.com/balloon-pilot.php\n| title = Professional Balloon Pilots\n| accessdate = 2007-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n<!--note most accidents and incidents are NOT notable enough to be mentioned here.

Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, [[Thunder and Colt]] (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\n\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is [[Ultramagic]] company, based in [[Spain]], which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\n\nOne of the 3 largest companies in the world is [[Kubicek Balloons]]. From its factory in [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic|Czehia]] the company ships its products worldwide. Produces from 100 to 115 balloons per year.  Kubicek company also focus on special shape balloons, FAA/EASA type certified and are delivered with a Standard Airworthiness Certificate.\n\n[[File:Guru Balloon guruballoon.com 407.758.7007.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last Aerostar International, Inc.

Suspended beneath is a [[Gondola (balloon)|gondola]] or [[wicker|wicker basket]] (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid [[propane]]. The heated air inside the envelope makes it [[buoyant]] since it has a [[ideal gas law|lower density]] than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all [[aircraft]], hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the [[atmosphere]]. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope there is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from [[nylon]] fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as [[Nomex]]. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.\n\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying [[flight]] technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Laurent d'Arlandes]] on November 21, 1783, in [[Paris]], [[France]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Lighter Than Air|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8018-9127-4|author=Tom D.

Other methods include a ''flat lap'' seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a ''zigzag'', where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.<ref name=madehow/>\n\n====Coatings====\n[[File:Ballooning Away in Maasai Mara.jpg|thumb|Hot air balloon safari in [[Maasai Mara]].|left]]The fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3 for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as [[silicone]] or [[polyurethane]], to make it impermeable to air.<ref name=\"Cameron\"/> It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too [[Porosity|porous]] to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a 'rag bag': cold inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.<ref name=\"MidAtlantic\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotairrepair.com/recoating/\n| title = Mid-Atlantic Balloon Repair: Balloon Envelope Fabric Recoating\n| accessdate = 2007-03-07}}</ref>\n\n====Sizes and capacity====\nA range of envelope sizes is available.

Some hot air balloons have ''turning vents'', which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.avianballoon.com/envelope.html\n| title = Avian Balloon Corporation: The Avian Envelope\n| accessdate = 2009-06-18}}</ref>\n\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a ''parachute vent'', invented by Tracy Barnes.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.ballooninghistory.com/barnes/\n| title = The early years of sport ballooning\n| publisher = David M. Wesner\n| accessdate = 2010-06-09}}</ref> The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \"vent lines\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a [[parachute]]\u2014thus the name.) These \"vent lines\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\n\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \"[[Velcro]]-style\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \"vent lines\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \"hook and loop\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \"maneuvering vent\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon.  Another common type of top design is the \"Smart Vent,\" which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \"parachute\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening.  This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \"pop top\" and \"MultiVent\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\n\n====Shape====\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \"inverted tear drop\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] on top of a truncated [[Cone (geometry)|cone]]. More-sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential [[Stress (physics)|stress]] on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \"natural\".<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.myairship.com/building/design.html\n| title = Airship and Blimp Resources: Balloon Envelope Design\n| accessdate = 2008-05-05}}</ref> Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize [[aerodynamic drag]] (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.balloonlife.com/2005/Aug-Sep05/racers.pdf\n| title = What\u2019s the Skinny on Racing Balloons?\n| accessdate = 2008-05-05\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313143144/http://www.balloonlife.com/2005/Aug-Sep05/racers.pdf\n| archive-date = 2012-03-13\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n===Basket===\n[[File:Hot Air Balloon Basket in Flight.jpg|thumb|right|Hot air balloon basket in flight]]\n[[File:wicker.balloon.basket.bath.arp.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Wicker|wicker basket]] capable of holding 16 passengers.]]\nBaskets are commonly made of [[Basket weaving|woven]] [[wicker]] or [[rattan]].

The valve may be spring-loaded so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a [[pilot light]] to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a [[flint]] striker or a [[lighter]], or with a built-in [[Piezoelectricity|piezo electric]] spark.<ref name=\"LindstrandFuel\">{{cite web\n| url = http://lindstrand.com/?id=14\n| title = Lindstrand Fuel System: Burners & Tanks\n| accessdate = 2007-03-05}}</ref>\n\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time depending on the desired heat output. Each burner is characterized by a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope, or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a [[gimbal]] to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a '''whisper burner''' and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\n\n===Fuel tanks===\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical [[pressure vessel]]s made from [[aluminium]], [[stainless steel]], or [[titanium]] with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a [[fuel gauge]] and a [[Pressure measurement|pressure gauge]].

This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by [[Buoyancy#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes' principle]]. The amount of lift (or [[buoyancy]]) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximum internal temperature is limited to approximately 120&nbsp;\u00b0C (250&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/d7a71e4def72db7e862573e900555227/$FILE/A33CE.pdf\n| title = Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Type certificate data sheet no. A33CE\n| accessdate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nThe melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximum [[operating temperature]] \u2014 about 230&nbsp;\u00b0C (450&nbsp;\u00b0F) \u2014 but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximum operating temperature of 120&nbsp;\u00b0C (250&nbsp;\u00b0F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope fabric life.\n\nThe lift generated by 100,000&nbsp;ft\u00b3 (2831.7&nbsp;m\u00b3) of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! air temperature\n! air density\n! air mass\n! lift generated\n|-\n| 68&nbsp;\u00b0F, 20&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 1.2041&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 7517&nbsp;lb, 3409.7&nbsp;kg\n| 0&nbsp;lb, 0&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| 210&nbsp;\u00b0F, 99&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 0.9486&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 5922&nbsp;lb, 2686.2&nbsp;kg\n| 1595&nbsp;lb, 723.5&nbsp;kg\n|-\n| 250&nbsp;\u00b0F, 120&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| 0.8978&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3\n| 5606&nbsp;lb, 2542.4&nbsp;kg\n| 1912&nbsp;lb, 867.3&nbsp;kg\n|}\n\nThe [[density of air]] at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, 68&nbsp;\u00b0F is about 1.2&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3. The total lift for a balloon of 100,000&nbsp;ft\u00b3 heated to  (99&nbsp;\u00b0C, 210&nbsp;\u00b0F) would be 1595&nbsp;lb, 723.5&nbsp;kg. This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\n\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (20&nbsp;\u00b0C, 68&nbsp;\u00b0F), a hot air balloon heated to (99&nbsp;\u00b0C, 210&nbsp;\u00b0F) requires about 3.91&nbsp;m\u00b3 of envelope volume to lift 1&nbsp;kilogram (62.5&nbsp;ft\u00b3/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% for each 1,000&nbsp;meters (1% per 1,000&nbsp;ft) of altitude gained.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.overflite.com/thermo.html\n|title = How to Calculate the Weight of Air and Model Hot Air Balloon Lift\n|accessdate = 2008-01-01}}</ref>\n\n====Montgolfier====\n[[File:Virgin Hot Air Balloon.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Virgin Balloon Flights|Virgin hot air balloon]] flying over [[Cambridge]].]]\nStandard hot air balloons are known as '''Montgolfier balloons''' and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/38360/1/05-1506.pdf \n |title=NASA: Montgolfiere balloon missions for Mars and Titan \n |accessdate=2008-06-04 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624220609/http://marstech.jpl.nasa.gov/publications/Jones_MontgolfiereBalloons_Inte.pdf \n |archivedate=2008-06-24 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> This style of balloon was developed by the [[Montgolfier brothers]], and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10 minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDbQVE3IdTcC&pg=PA177&dq=montgolfier+brothers+1783&client=firefox-a ''Scientific American Inventions and Discoveries''], p 177, Rodney P.

[[Hydrogen]] gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the danger of introducing an open flame near the gas.  All modern Roziere balloons now use helium as a [[lifting gas]].<ref name=\"Amsbaugh\">{{cite web\n| url = http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/directline/dl9_balloon.htm\n| title = Balloon Incidents\n| last = Amsbaugh\n| first = Allen\n| accessdate = 2009-01-16}}</ref>\n\n====Solar====\n[[Image:Solarballon Hot 18 Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|A 4 meters high solar balloon floating over a meadow.]]\n[[Solar balloon]]s are hot air balloons that use just [[Solar power#Solar thermal|solar energy]] captured by a dark envelope to heat the air inside.<ref name=\"Solar\">{{cite web\n| url = http://perso.orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-index.htm\n| title = Solar Balloons\n| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Steering===\nHot air balloon can be steered to a limited degree by changing the altitude of the flight. Wind in the northern hemisphere tends to turn right due to [[coriolis effect]] as the altitude increases.\n\n==Safety equipment==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\n\n===In the basket===\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\n\nA [[fire extinguisher]] suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2 &nbsp;kg [[Fire classes|AB:E]] type fire extinguisher.\n\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20\u201330 meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\n\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\n\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\n\n===On the occupants===\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as [[nomex]]) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as [[cotton]], [[linen]], [[hemp]], or [[wool]], or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity.  Most engineered fibers (with the exception of [[rayon]], which is also safe to wear) are [[thermoplastic]]; many are also [[hydrocarbons]].  This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels.  Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable.  Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\n\n===On the ground crew===\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\n\n==Maintenance and repair==\n[[File:Balloonreflection.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Taken from the basket, the reflection of the balloon can be seen in the lake below. Obstacles in the landscape can inhibit smooth retrieval of the balloon upon landing.]]\n\n[[File:2015 Birds In Hand Balloons 02 image FRD.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A commercial balloon ride approaching its landing site at [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania]]]]\n\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\n\n===Maintenance===\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents [[mold]] and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\n\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\n\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.brisbanehotairballooning.com.au/ballooning-basics/\n| title = Ballooning Basics\n| accessdate = 2019-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===Repair===\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\n\n==Licensing==\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\n\n===Balloons===\n[[File:Setting up hot air balloon, Poughkeepsie, NY 2.JPG|right|thumb|Top of balloon during inflation. [[Crew]] is securing parachute vent.]]\nAs with other aircraft in the US, balloons must be registered (have an [[Aircraft registration|N-number]]), have an [[airworthiness]] certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155&nbsp;pounds or 70&nbsp;kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight aircraft]].\n\n===Pilots===\n\n====In Australia====\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.abf.net.au/\n| title = Australian Ballooning Federation\n| accessdate = 2015-03-28}}</ref>\nand typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotair.com.au/pages/FAQs.html#faq15\n| title = Hot Air FAQ: What regulations are in Place?\n| accessdate = 2009-06-22\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100110215940/http://www.hotair.com.au/pages/FAQs.html#faq15\n| archive-date = 2010-01-10\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n====In the UK====\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required.{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=how can pilot have copy of license not held?}} For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\n\n====In the United States====\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a [[Pilot certification in the United States|pilot certificate]] from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and it must carry the rating of \"Lighter-than-air free balloon\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \"Limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an [[Ultralight aviation|ultralight]] aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot air balloons meet the criteria.\n\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some [[Hot air balloon festivals|balloon festivals]]), a pilot must have a [[Pilot certification in the United States#Commercial|commercial pilot certificate]]. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon [[flight instructor]]s. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.<ref name=\"Professional Pilots\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.hotairballooning.com/balloon-pilot.php\n| title = Professional Balloon Pilots\n| accessdate = 2007-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n<!--note most accidents and incidents are NOT notable enough to be mentioned here.

Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company, [[Thunder and Colt]] (since acquired by Cameron), have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop shaped balloons but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\n\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons in the world is [[Ultramagic]] company, based in [[Spain]], which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\n\nOne of the 3 largest companies in the world is [[Kubicek Balloons]]. From its factory in [[Brno]], [[Czech Republic|Czehia]] the company ships its products worldwide. Produces from 100 to 115 balloons per year.  Kubicek company also focus on special shape balloons, FAA/EASA type certified and are delivered with a Standard Airworthiness Certificate.\n\n[[File:Guru Balloon guruballoon.com 407.758.7007.jpg|thumb|right|One of the last Aerostar International, Inc.

It is known for [[blackbuck]]s and is also home to a variety of [[birds]]. The sanctuary is 210&nbsp;km from [[Jaipur]] on the fringe of the Great Indian Desert and situated on road from [[Ratangarh, Churu|Ratangarh]] to [[Sujangarh]]. The Tal [[Chhapar]] sanctuary lies in the [[Sujangarh]] Tehsil of [[Churu District]]. It lies on the [[Nokha, Bikaner|Nokha]]-[[Sujangarh]] state highway and is situated at a distance of 85&nbsp;km from [[Churu, Rajasthan|Churu]] and about 132&nbsp;km from [[Bikaner]]. The nearest railway station is Chappar which lies on Degana-Churu-Rewari line of North Western Railways. The nearest airport is Jaipur which is 215&nbsp;km from Chappar.\n\nTal Chhapar is a refuge of the [[blackbuck]].\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe sanctuary is named after [[Chhapar]] village which is located at 27\u00b0-50' North and 74\u00b0-25' East.  It is a flat saline depression locally known as a \"tal\" that has a unique [[ecosystem]] in the heart of the [[Thar Desert]]. Perched at a height of 302 meters<ref>{{cite web |title=Tal Chapar Sanctuary |url=http://rajasthantourism.gov.in/Attractions/EcoTourismZones/TalChaparSanctuary.aspx |date=29 Feb 2012|publisher=rajasthantourism.gov.in }}</ref> (990&nbsp;feet) above sea level. Tal Chhaper Sanctuary, with almost flat tract and interspersed shallow low-lying areas, has open grassland with scattered ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Prosopis]]'' trees which give it an appearance of a typical [[savanna]].  The word \"tal\" means plane land.  The rain water flows through shallow low-lying areas and collect in the small seasonal water ponds.\n\nThe geology of the zone is obscured by the wind blown over-burden.  Some small hillocks and exposed rocks of slate and quartzite are found in the western side of the sanctuary. The area between hillocks and the sanctuary constitutes the watershed area of the sanctuary.  The whole sanctuary used to be flooded by water during the heavy rains but with salt mining going on in the watershed, hardly any rain falling on the hillocks reaches the sanctuary. Near by villages are Jogalia, Jaitasar, Bidasar.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Spectacled Cobra.jpg|right|thumb|Cobra in sanctuary]] -->\nThe forest of this region falls under major group \"Tropical Forest\"  as per classifications of Indian forests by [[Harry George Champion|Champion]] & Seth.  The forest of sanctuary area again falls under the group \"Topical Thorn Forest\" and sub group 6B/C \"Desert Thorn Forests\".\n\nThe sanctuary area is mostly covered by grasses with a very few trees.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:The Grassland of Tal Chhapar.jpg|right|thumb|The Grassland of Tal Chhapar]] -->\nIt lies on the passageway of many [[migratory birds]] such as [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]]. These birds pass through this area during September. Birds commonly seen in the sanctuary are harriers, [[eastern imperial eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]], and [[little green bee-eater]]s, [[black ibis]] and [[demoiselle crane]]s, which stay till March. [[Skylark]]s, [[crested lark]]s, [[Ring-necked dove|ring doves]], and brown doves are seen throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Asif N|year=2015|title=Birding in North-West India|url=http://www.bnhsenvis.nic.in/PublicationArchiveDetails.aspx?SubLinkId=168&LinkId=754&Year=2015|journal=Buceros|volume=(20) 1|pages=10\u201317|via=}}</ref>\n[[Fennec fox|Desert fox]] and [[desert cat]] can also be spotted along with typical [[Bird|avifauna]] such as [[partridge]] and [[sand grouse]].\n\nTal Chappar Sanctuary comes alive with the chirping of various migratory birds including [[Montagu's harrier]], [[marsh harrier]], [[pale harrier]], imperial eagle, tawny eagle, short toed eagle, sparrow hawk, skylark, crested lark, ring drove, brown dove, blue jay, [[southern grey shrike]], Indian spotted creeper, green bee eaters, black ibis and demoiselle cranes.\n[[File:Southern_Grey_Shrike.jpg|thumb|Southern Grey Shrike]]\n[[File:Indian_Spotted_Creeper-Feeding.jpg|thumb|Indian Spotted Creeper-Feeding]]\n<gallery>\nImage:Herd of Bucks.jpeg|[[Blackbuck]]s\nImage:Dicrurus macrocercus -Tal Chhapar Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India -immature-8.jpg|''[[Dicrurus macrocercus]]''\nImage:Aquila rapax.jpg|''[[Aquila rapax]]''\nImage:Antilope cervicapra Tal Chhappr.jpg|''[[Antilope cervicapra]]''\nImage:Falco_chicquera.jpg|''[[Falco chicquera]]''\nImage:Ardeotis nigriceps -Rajasthan, India-6.jpg|''[[Ardeotis nigriceps]]''\n</gallery>\n\nIn the Tal Chhapar Sanctuary, a special type of grass is found. This grass is called ''Mothiya'' locally. The word \"Mothiya\" comes from the word \"Moti\" or from the Hindi word for pearl. The shape of the seed of this grass is like very fine round shaped pearls. Mothiya has a very sweet taste. People enjoy eating it, but it is found in very small quantities. Production is only a few kilograms every season. Mothiya is also food for blackbucks and birds which dig it from the earth with their starks.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Dust Devil.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|Dust devil]] \nThis region is characterized by a distinct winter (from October to February), summer (March to June) and monsoon (July to September). The zone has a dry climate with a large variation in temperature wind blows south \u2013 west during summer. In May and June winds become very hot and that is called \"loo\" The maximum temperature reaches up to {{convert|48|C|F}} in June and the minimum temperature falls to {{convert|10|C|F}} in December \u2013 January. The Tal Chhapar Zone comes under the principal arid zone of the country. Rainfall in this region is highly erratic. There is a large variation in mean annual rainfall in this region. The average rainfall in this region is about 300&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Tal Chappar.jpg|thumb|Facilities - Tal Chappar sanctuary]]\nThere are two rest houses situated in the sanctuary area and being maintained by the forest department having four suites accommodation.  These rest houses come under the control of Deputy conservator of forest, Churu. Anyone can contact for accommodation to DCF, Churu. [[Chhapar]] \u2013 [[Sujangarh]] state highway divides the sanctuary area into two parts.

It is known for [[blackbuck]]s and is also home to a variety of [[birds]]. The sanctuary is 210&nbsp;km from [[Jaipur]] on the fringe of the Great Indian Desert and situated on road from [[Ratangarh, Churu|Ratangarh]] to [[Sujangarh]]. The Tal [[Chhapar]] sanctuary lies in the [[Sujangarh]] Tehsil of [[Churu District]]. It lies on the [[Nokha, Bikaner|Nokha]]-[[Sujangarh]] state highway and is situated at a distance of 85&nbsp;km from [[Churu]] and about 132&nbsp;km from [[Bikaner]]. The nearest railway station is Chappar which lies on Degana-Churu-Rewari line of North Western Railways. The nearest airport is Jaipur which is 215&nbsp;km from Chappar.\n\nTal Chhapar is a refuge of the [[blackbuck]].\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe sanctuary is named after [[Chhapar]] village which is located at 27\u00b0-50' North and 74\u00b0-25' East.  It is a flat saline depression locally known as a \"tal\" that has a unique [[ecosystem]] in the heart of the [[Thar Desert]]. Perched at a height of 302 meters<ref>{{cite web |title=Tal Chapar Sanctuary |url=http://rajasthantourism.gov.in/Attractions/EcoTourismZones/TalChaparSanctuary.aspx |date=29 Feb 2012|publisher=rajasthantourism.gov.in }}</ref> (990&nbsp;feet) above sea level. Tal Chhaper Sanctuary, with almost flat tract and interspersed shallow low-lying areas, has open grassland with scattered ''[[Acacia]]'' and ''[[Prosopis]]'' trees which give it an appearance of a typical [[savanna]].  The word \"tal\" means plane land.  The rain water flows through shallow low-lying areas and collect in the small seasonal water ponds.\n\nThe geology of the zone is obscured by the wind blown over-burden.  Some small hillocks and exposed rocks of slate and quartzite are found in the western side of the sanctuary. The area between hillocks and the sanctuary constitutes the watershed area of the sanctuary.  The whole sanctuary used to be flooded by water during the heavy rains but with salt mining going on in the watershed, hardly any rain falling on the hillocks reaches the sanctuary. Near by villages are Jogalia, Jaitasar, Bidasar.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Spectacled Cobra.jpg|right|thumb|Cobra in sanctuary]] -->\nThe forest of this region falls under major group \"Tropical Forest\"  as per classifications of Indian forests by [[Harry George Champion|Champion]] & Seth.  The forest of sanctuary area again falls under the group \"Topical Thorn Forest\" and sub group 6B/C \"Desert Thorn Forests\".\n\nThe sanctuary area is mostly covered by grasses with a very few trees.\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:The Grassland of Tal Chhapar.jpg|right|thumb|The Grassland of Tal Chhapar]] -->\nIt lies on the passageway of many [[migratory birds]] such as [[Harrier (bird)|harriers]]. These birds pass through this area during September. Birds commonly seen in the sanctuary are harriers, [[eastern imperial eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]], and [[little green bee-eater]]s, [[black ibis]] and [[demoiselle crane]]s, which stay till March. [[Skylark]]s, [[crested lark]]s, [[Ring-necked dove|ring doves]], and brown doves are seen throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Asif N|year=2015|title=Birding in North-West India|url=http://www.bnhsenvis.nic.in/PublicationArchiveDetails.aspx?SubLinkId=168&LinkId=754&Year=2015|journal=Buceros|volume=(20) 1|pages=10\u201317|via=}}</ref>\n[[Fennec fox|Desert fox]] and [[desert cat]] can also be spotted along with typical [[Bird|avifauna]] such as [[partridge]] and [[sand grouse]].\n\nTal Chappar Sanctuary comes alive with the chirping of various migratory birds including [[Montagu's harrier]], [[marsh harrier]], [[pale harrier]], imperial eagle, tawny eagle, short toed eagle, sparrow hawk, skylark, crested lark, ring drove, brown dove, blue jay, [[southern grey shrike]], Indian spotted creeper, green bee eaters, black ibis and demoiselle cranes.\n[[File:Southern_Grey_Shrike.jpg|thumb|Southern Grey Shrike]]\n[[File:Indian_Spotted_Creeper-Feeding.jpg|thumb|Indian Spotted Creeper-Feeding]]\n<gallery>\nImage:Herd of Bucks.jpeg|[[Blackbuck]]s\nImage:Dicrurus macrocercus -Tal Chhapar Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan, India -immature-8.jpg|''[[Dicrurus macrocercus]]''\nImage:Aquila rapax.jpg|''[[Aquila rapax]]''\nImage:Antilope cervicapra Tal Chhappr.jpg|''[[Antilope cervicapra]]''\nImage:Falco_chicquera.jpg|''[[Falco chicquera]]''\nImage:Ardeotis nigriceps -Rajasthan, India-6.jpg|''[[Ardeotis nigriceps]]''\n</gallery>\n\nIn the Tal Chhapar Sanctuary, a special type of grass is found. This grass is called ''Mothiya'' locally. The word \"Mothiya\" comes from the word \"Moti\" or from the Hindi word for pearl. The shape of the seed of this grass is like very fine round shaped pearls. Mothiya has a very sweet taste. People enjoy eating it, but it is found in very small quantities. Production is only a few kilograms every season. Mothiya is also food for blackbucks and birds which dig it from the earth with their starks.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Dust Devil.jpeg|thumb|100px|right|Dust devil]] \nThis region is characterized by a distinct winter (from October to February), summer (March to June) and monsoon (July to September). The zone has a dry climate with a large variation in temperature wind blows south \u2013 west during summer. In May and June winds become very hot and that is called \"loo\" The maximum temperature reaches up to {{convert|48|C|F}} in June and the minimum temperature falls to {{convert|10|C|F}} in December \u2013 January. The Tal Chhapar Zone comes under the principal arid zone of the country. Rainfall in this region is highly erratic. There is a large variation in mean annual rainfall in this region. The average rainfall in this region is about 300&nbsp;mm.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:Tal Chappar.jpg|thumb|Facilities - Tal Chappar sanctuary]]\nThere are two rest houses situated in the sanctuary area and being maintained by the forest department having four suites accommodation.  These rest houses come under the control of Deputy conservator of forest, Churu. Anyone can contact for accommodation to DCF, Churu.

With their single-celled growth habit, yeasts can be contrasted with [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, which grow [[hypha]]e. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called [[dimorphic fungi]].\n\nThe yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' converts [[carbohydrate]]s to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ethanol|alcohols]] in a process known as [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. The products of this reaction have been used in [[baking]] and the production of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years.<ref name=Legras2007/> ''S. cerevisiae'' is also an important [[model organism]] in modern [[cell biology]] research, and is one of the most thoroughly studied [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms. Researchers have cultured it in order to understand the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology in great detail.<ref name=\"Ostergaard 2000\"/> Other species of yeasts, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', are [[opportunistic pathogen]]s and can cause [[yeast infection|infections]] in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in [[microbial fuel cell]]s<ref name=\"YeastRef3\"/> and to produce [[ethanol]] for the [[biofuel]] industry.\n\nYeasts do not form a single [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] or [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] grouping. The term \"yeast\" is often taken as a [[synonym]] for ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'',<ref name=Kurtzman1994/> but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate [[phylum|phyla]]: the [[Ascomycota]] and the [[Basidiomycota]]. The budding yeasts or \"true yeasts\" are classified in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Saccharomycetales]],<ref name=\"YeastRef2\"/> within the phylum Ascomycota.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of wine|History of beer}}\nThe word \"yeast\" comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gist'', ''gyst'', and from the [[Proto Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''yes-'', meaning \"boil\", \"foam\", or \"bubble\".<ref name=\"Bartleby2000\"/> Yeast microbes are probably one of the earliest domesticated organisms. Archaeologists digging in Egyptian ruins found early grinding stones and baking chambers for yeast-raised bread, as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries.<ref name=NASA/> In 1680, [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] naturalist [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] first [[microscopy|microscopically]] observed yeast, but at the time did not consider them to be [[organism|living organisms]], but rather globular structures<ref name=YeastRef11/> as researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae or fungi.<ref name=\"Ainsworth 1976\"/>  [[Theodor Schwann]] recognized them as fungi in 1837.<ref name=\"Schwann 1837\"/><ref name=\"Barnett 2004\"/>\n\nIn 1857, French microbiologist [[Louis Pasteur]] showed that by bubbling oxygen into the yeast broth, [[cell growth]] could be increased, but fermentation was inhibited&nbsp;\u2013 an observation later called the \"[[Pasteur effect]]\". In the paper \"''M\u00e9moire sur la fermentation alcoolique,''\" Pasteur proved that alcoholic fermentation was conducted by living yeasts and not by a chemical catalyst.<ref name=\"NASA\" /><ref name=\"Barnett2003\" />\n\nBy the late 18th century two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified: ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' (top-fermenting yeast) and ''[[Saccharomyces carlsbergensis|S.&nbsp;carlsbergensis]]'' (bottom-fermenting yeast). ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' has been sold commercially by the Dutch for bread-making since 1780; while, around 1800, the Germans started producing ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' in the form of cream. In 1825, a method was developed to remove the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks.<ref name=Klieger2004/> The industrial production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the [[filter press]] in 1867. In 1872, Baron Max de Springer developed a manufacturing process to create granulated yeast, a technique that was used until the first World War.<ref name=\"urlLe Comit\u00e9 des Fabricants de levure&nbsp;\u2014 COFALEC&nbsp;\u2014 repr\u00e9sente les fabricants\"/> In the United States, naturally occurring airborne yeasts were used almost exclusively until commercial yeast was marketed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876 in Philadelphia, where [[Charles L. Fleischmann]] exhibited the product and a process to use it, as well as serving the resultant baked bread.<ref name=Snodgrass2004/>\n\nThe [[refrigeration|mechanical refrigerator]] (first patented in the 1850s in Europe) liberated [[Brewing|brewers]] and [[winemakers]] from seasonal constraints for the first time and allowed them to exit cellars and other earthen environments. For [[John Molson]], who made his livelihood in [[Montreal]] prior to the development of the fridge, the brewing season lasted from September through to May. The same seasonal restrictions formerly governed the [[distiller]]'s art.<ref name=jm/>\n\n== Nutrition and growth ==\nYeasts are [[chemoorganotroph]]s, as they use [[organic compound]]s as a source of energy and do not require sunlight to grow. Carbon is obtained mostly from [[hexose]] sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], or disaccharides such as [[sucrose]] and [[maltose]]. Some species can metabolize [[pentose]] sugars such as ribose,<ref name=Barnett1975/> alcohols, and [[organic acid]]s. Yeast species either require oxygen for aerobic [[cellular respiration]] ([[obligate aerobe]]s) or are anaerobic, but also have aerobic methods of energy production ([[facultative anaerobe]]s). Unlike [[bacteria]], no known yeast species grow only anaerobically ([[obligate anaerobe]]s). Most yeasts grow best in a neutral or slightly acidic pH environment.\n\nYeasts vary in regard to the temperature range in which they grow best. For example, ''[[Leucosporidium frigidum]]'' grows at {{convert|-2|to|20|C|F}}, ''[[Saccharomyces telluris]]'' at {{convert|5|to|35|C|F}}, and ''[[Candida slooffi]]'' at {{convert|28|to|45|C|F}}.<ref name=Arthur1976/> The cells can survive freezing under certain conditions, with viability decreasing over time.\n\nIn general, yeasts are grown in the laboratory on solid [[growth medium|growth media]] or in liquid [[broth]]s. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include [[potato dextrose agar]] or [[potato dextrose broth]], Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient [[agar]], yeast [[peptone]] [[dextrose]] agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who cultivate yeast frequently use dried [[malt extract]] and agar as a solid growth medium. The [[fungicide]] [[cycloheximide]] is sometimes added to yeast growth media to inhibit the growth of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'' yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast species. This will change the yeast process.\n\nThe appearance of a white, thready yeast, commonly known as kahm yeast, is often a byproduct of the lactofermentation (or pickling) of certain vegetables, usually the result of exposure to air. Although harmless, it can give pickled vegetables a bad flavor and must be removed regularly during fermentation.<ref name=Kaufmann2002/>\n\n== Ecology ==\nYeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or [[peach]]es), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects.<ref name=Suh2005/><ref name=Slavikova2003/> The ecological function and [[biodiversity]] of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=Herrera2002/> Yeasts, including ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula]] rubra'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', have been found living in between people's toes as part of their [[skin flora]].<ref name=Oyeka2002/> Yeasts are also present in the [[gut flora]] of mammals and some insects<ref name=Martini1992/> and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.<ref name=Bass2007/><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kutty SN, Philip R | url = http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/purl/2035/Marine%20yeasts-a%20rewiew.pdf| doi = 10.1002/yea.1599 | title = Marine yeasts\u2014a review | journal = Yeast | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 465\u2013483| year = 2008 | pmid = 18615863}}</ref>\n\nAn Indian study of seven [[honey bee|bee]] species and nine plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonize the [[nectaries]] of flowers and honey stomachs of bees. Most were members of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''; the most common species in honey stomachs was ''[[Dekkera intermedia]]'' and in flower nectaries, ''[[Candida blankii]]''.<ref name=Sandhu1985/> Yeast colonising nectaries of the [[stinking hellebore]] have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of [[volatile organic compound]]s.<ref name=Herrera2002/><ref name=Barley2010/> A [[black yeast]] has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between [[ant]]s, their [[ant-fungus mutualism|mutualistic fungus]], a fungal [[parasite]] of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite.

Early classification was based on a few species that reproduced asexually (anamorph form) through multipolar budding.<ref name=Custers1940/> Shortly after, the formation of ascospores was observed and the genus ''Dekkera'', which reproduces sexually (teleomorph form), was introduced as part of the taxonomy.<ref name=VanderWalt1984/> The current taxonomy includes five species within the genera of ''Dekkera/Brettanomyces''. Those are the anamorphs ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces anomalus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces custersianus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces naardenensis]]'', and ''[[Brettanomyces nanus]]'', with teleomorphs existing for the first two species, ''[[Dekkera bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Dekkera anomala]]''.<ref name=Oelofse2008/> The distinction between ''Dekkera'' and ''Brettanomyces'' is arguable, with Oelofse et al.

Over the past decade, ''Brettanomyces'' spp. have seen an increasing use in the craft-brewing sector of the industry, with a handful of breweries having produced beers that were primarily fermented with pure cultures of ''Brettanomyces'' spp. This has occurred out of experimentation, as very little information exists regarding pure culture fermentative capabilities and the aromatic compounds produced by various strains. ''Dekkera''/''Brettanomyces'' spp. have been the subjects of numerous studies conducted over the past century, although a majority of the recent research has focused on enhancing the knowledge of the wine industry.

Yeast is normally already present on grape skins. [[Fermentation (wine)|Fermentation]] can be done with this endogenous \"wild yeast\",<ref name =Ross/> but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact types of yeast species present.

This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air pockets \"set\", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, ''Saccharomyces exiguus'' (also known as ''S.&nbsp;minor''), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this evaporates during baking.<ref name=\"MooreLandecker1996p533-534\"/>\n\n[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|A block of compressed fresh yeast]]\nIt is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread. The first records that show this use came from [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name=Legras2007/> Researchers speculate a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the [[flour]] caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the normal flat, hard cake.\n\n[[File:Dry yeast.jpg|thumb|right|Active dried yeast, a granulated form in which yeast is commercially sold]]\nToday, there are several retailers of baker's yeast; one of the earlier developments in North America is [[Fleischmann's Yeast]], in 1868. During World War II, Fleischmann's developed a [[wikt:granulate|granulated]] active dry yeast which did not require refrigeration, had a longer [[shelf life]] than fresh yeast, and rose twice as fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square \"cake\". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A weak solution of water and sugar can be used to determine whether yeast is expired. In the solution, active yeast will foam and bubble as it ferments the sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some recipes refer to this as [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] the yeast, as it \"proves\" (tests) the viability of the yeast before the other ingredients are added. When a [[sourdough]] starter is used, flour and water are added instead of sugar; this is referred to as proofing the [[Sponge and dough|sponge]].{{Citation needed|reason='Reliable sources needed for the whole paragraph, also maybe some irrelevant information for an WP article'|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhen yeast is used for making bread, it is mixed with [[flour]], salt, and warm water or milk. The dough is [[Kneading|kneaded]] until it is smooth, and then left to rise, sometimes until it has doubled in size. The dough is then shaped into loaves. Some bread doughs are knocked back after one rising and left to rise again (this is called [[proofing (baking technique)|dough proofing]]) and then baked. A longer rising time gives a better flavor, but the yeast can fail to raise the bread in the final stages if it is left for too long initially.\n\n=== Bioremediation ===\nSome yeasts can find potential application in the field of [[bioremediation]]. One such yeast, ''[[Yarrowia lipolytica]]'', is known to degrade [[palm oil]] mill [[effluent]], [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (an explosive material), and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, such as [[alkane]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, fats and oils.<ref name=\"Zinjard 2014\"/> It can also tolerate high concentrations of salt and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]],<ref name=Bankar2009rev/> and is being investigated for its potential as a heavy metal [[Biosorption|biosorbent]].<ref name=Bankar2009/> ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' has potential to bioremediate toxic pollutants like [[arsenic]] from industrial effluent.<ref name=\"Soares 2012\"/> Bronze statues are known to be degraded by certain species of yeast.<ref name=\"Cappitelli 2008\"/> Different yeasts from Brazilian gold mines [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] free and [[Coordination complex|complexed]] silver ions.<ref name=\"Singh 2006\"/>\n\n=== Industrial ethanol production ===\n{{See also|Biofuel#Bioalcohols|label 1=Bioethanol}}\nThe ability of yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been harnessed by the biotechnology industry to produce [[ethanol fuel]]. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as [[sugar cane]], [[field corn]], or other [[cereal grain]]s, and then adding dilute [[sulfuric acid]], or fungal alpha [[amylase]] enzymes, to break down the starches into complex sugars. A glucoamylase is then added to break the complex sugars down into simple sugars.

Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in yeast; these proteins include [[cell cycle protein]]s, [[Cell signaling|signaling proteins]], and protein-processing [[enzyme]]s.<ref name=\"Conn 2007\"/>\n\nOn 24 April 1996, ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' was announced to be the first eukaryote to have its [[genome]], consisting of 12 million [[base pair]]s, fully sequenced as part of the [[Genome Project]].<ref name=Williams1996/> At the time, it was the most complex organism to have its full genome sequenced, and the work seven years and the involvement of more than 100 laboratories to accomplish.<ref name=accessexcellence/> The second yeast species to have its genome sequenced was ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'', which was completed in 2002.<ref name=Wood2002/><ref name=Reinert2002/> It was the sixth eukaryotic genome sequenced and consists of 13.8&nbsp;million base pairs. As of 2014, over 50 yeast species have had their genomes sequenced and published.<ref name=\"Piskur 2014\"/>\n\nGenomic and functional gene annotation of the two major yeast models can be accessed via their respective [[model organism databases]]: SGD<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yeastgenome.org |title=About SGD |website=Saccharomyces Genome Database}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cherry |first1=JM |last2=Hong |first2=EL |last3=Amundsen |first3=C |last4=Balakrishnan |first4=R |last5=Binkley |first5=G |last6=Chan |first6=ET |last7=Christie |first7=KR |last8=Costanzo |first8=MC |last9=Dwight |first9=SS |last10=Engel |first10=SR |last11=Fisk |first11=DG |last12=Hirschman |first12=JE |last13=Hitz |first13=BC |last14=Karra |first14=K |last15=Krieger |first15=CJ |last16=Miyasato |first16=SR |last17=Nash |first17=RS |last18=Park |first18=J |last19=Skrzypek |first19=MS |last20=Simison |first20=M |last21=Weng |first21=S |last22=Wong |first22=ED |title=Saccharomyces Genome Database: the genomics resource of budding yeast. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=January 2012 |volume=40 |issue=Database issue |pages=D700\u20135 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkr1029 |pmid=22110037|pmc=3245034 }}</ref> and PomBase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pombase.org |title=PomBase}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lock |first1=A |last2=Rutherford |first2=K |last3=Harris |first3=MA |last4=Hayles |first4=J |last5=Oliver |first5=SG |last6=B\u00e4hler |first6=J |last7=Wood |first7=V |title=PomBase 2018: user-driven reimplementation of the fission yeast database provides rapid and intuitive access to diverse, interconnected information. |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=47 |issue=D1 |pages=D821\u2013D827 |date=13 October 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky961 |pmid=30321395|pmc=6324063 }}</ref>\n\n=== Genetically engineered biofactories ===\nVarious yeast species have been genetically engineered to efficiently produce various drugs, a technique called [[metabolic engineering]]. ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' is easy to genetically engineer; its physiology, metabolism and genetics are well known, and it is amenable for use in harsh industrial conditions. A wide variety of chemical in different classes can be produced by engineered yeast, including [[phenols|phenolics]], [[isoprenoid]]s, [[alkaloid]]s, and [[polyketide]]s.<ref name=\"Siddiqui 2012\"/> About 20% of [[biopharmaceutical]]s are produced in ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'', including [[insulin]], [[vaccine]]s for [[hepatitis]], and [[human serum albumin]].<ref name=\"Nielsen 2012\"/>\n\n== Pathogenic yeasts ==\n[[File:C albicans en.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[photomicrograph]] of ''[[Candida albicans]]'' showing hyphal outgrowth and other morphological characteristics]]\nSome species of yeast are [[opportunistic pathogen]]s that can cause infection in people with compromised [[immune system]]s. ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus gattii]]'' are significant pathogens of [[immunocompromised]] people. They are the species primarily responsible for [[cryptococcosis]], a fungal disease that occurs in about one million [[HIV/AIDS]] patients, causing over 600,000 deaths annually.<ref name=\"Cogliati 2013\"/> The cells of these yeast are surrounded by a rigid [[polysaccharide]] capsule, which helps to prevent them from being recognised and engulfed by [[white blood cell]]s in the human body.<ref name=\"O'Meara 2012\"/>\n\nYeasts of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', another group of opportunistic pathogens, cause [[Oral candidiasis|oral]] and [[vaginal infection]]s in humans, known as [[candidiasis]]. ''Candida'' is commonly found as a [[commensal]] yeast in the [[mucous membrane]]s of humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, sometimes these same strains can become pathogenic. The yeast cells sprout a [[hypha]]l outgrowth, which locally penetrates the [[mucous membrane|mucosal membrane]], causing irritation and shedding of the tissues.<ref name=YeastRef9/> A book from the 1980s listed the pathogenic yeasts of candidiasis in probable descending order of [[virulence]] for humans as: ''[[Candida albicans|C.&nbsp;albicans]]'', ''[[Candida tropicalis|C.&nbsp;tropicalis]]'', ''[[Candida stellatoidea|C.&nbsp;stellatoidea]]'', ''[[Candida glabrata|C.&nbsp;glabrata]]'', ''[[Candida krusei|C.&nbsp;krusei]]'', ''[[Candida parapsilosis|C.&nbsp;parapsilosis]]'', ''[[Candida guilliermondii|C.&nbsp;guilliermondii]]'', ''[[Candida viswanathii|C.&nbsp;viswanathii]]'', ''[[Candida lusitaniae|C.&nbsp;lusitaniae]]'', and ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula mucilaginosa]]''.<ref name=Hurley1987/> ''Candida glabrata'' is the second most common ''Candida'' pathogen after ''C.&nbsp;albicans'', causing infections of the [[urogenital tract]], and of the [[bloodstream]] ([[candidemia]]).<ref name=\"Brunke 2013\"/> ''[[Candida auris|C.&nbsp;auris]]'' has been more recently identified.\n\n== Food spoilage ==\nYeasts are able to grow in foods with a low pH (5.0 or lower) and in the presence of sugars, organic acids, and other easily metabolized carbon sources.<ref name=Kurtzman3/> During their growth, yeasts metabolize some food components and produce metabolic end products. This causes the physical, chemical, and sensible properties of a food to change, and the food is spoiled.<ref name=Fleet/> The growth of yeast within food products is often seen on their surfaces, as in cheeses or meats, or by the fermentation of sugars in beverages, such as juices, and semiliquid products, such as [[syrup]]s and [[jam]]s.<ref name=Kurtzman3/> The yeast of the genus ''[[Zygosaccharomyces]]'' have had a long history as spoilage yeasts within the [[food industry]]. This is mainly because these species can grow in the presence of high sucrose, ethanol, [[acetic acid]], [[sorbic acid]], [[benzoic acid]], and [[sulfur dioxide]] concentrations,<ref name=Loureiro2003/> representing some of the commonly used [[food preservation]] methods. [[Methylene blue]] is used to test for the presence of live yeast cells.<ref name=Downes2001/> In [[oenology]], the major spoilage yeast is ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]''.\n\n''[[Candida blankii]]'' has been detected in [[Iberian ham]] and meat.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIgeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA140 |title=Handbook of Fermented Meat and Poultry|first1=Fidel |last1=Toldr\u00e1 |page=140 |edition=2nd |editor-first1=Fidel |editor-last1= Toldr\u00e1 |editor-first2= Y.

Most were members of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''; the most common species in honey bee stomachs was ''[[Dekkera intermedia]]'', while the most common species colonising flower nectaries was ''[[Candida blankii]]''.

With their single-celled growth habit, yeasts can be contrasted with [[mold]]s, which grow [[hypha]]e. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called [[dimorphic fungi]].\n\nThe yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' converts [[carbohydrate]]s to [[carbon dioxide]] and [[ethanol|alcohols]] in a process known as [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. The products of this reaction have been used in [[baking]] and the production of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years.<ref name=Legras2007/> ''S. cerevisiae'' is also an important [[model organism]] in modern [[cell biology]] research, and is one of the most thoroughly studied [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms. Researchers have cultured it in order to understand the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology in great detail.<ref name=\"Ostergaard 2000\"/> Other species of yeasts, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', are [[opportunistic pathogen]]s and can cause [[yeast infection|infections]] in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in [[microbial fuel cell]]s<ref name=\"YeastRef3\"/> and to produce [[ethanol]] for the [[biofuel]] industry.\n\nYeasts do not form a single [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] or [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] grouping. The term \"yeast\" is often taken as a [[synonym]] for ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'',<ref name=Kurtzman1994/> but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate [[phylum|phyla]]: the [[Ascomycota]] and the [[Basidiomycota]]. The budding yeasts or \"true yeasts\" are classified in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Saccharomycetales]],<ref name=\"YeastRef2\"/> within the phylum Ascomycota.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of wine|History of beer}}\nThe word \"yeast\" comes from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gist'', ''gyst'', and from the [[Proto Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''yes-'', meaning \"boil\", \"foam\", or \"bubble\".<ref name=\"Bartleby2000\"/> Yeast microbes are probably one of the earliest domesticated organisms. Archaeologists digging in Egyptian ruins found early grinding stones and baking chambers for yeast-raised bread, as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries.<ref name=NASA/> In 1680, [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] naturalist [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] first [[microscopy|microscopically]] observed yeast, but at the time did not consider them to be [[organism|living organisms]], but rather globular structures<ref name=YeastRef11/> as researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae or fungi.<ref name=\"Ainsworth 1976\"/>  [[Theodor Schwann]] recognized them as fungi in 1837.<ref name=\"Schwann 1837\"/><ref name=\"Barnett 2004\"/>\n\nIn 1857, French microbiologist [[Louis Pasteur]] showed that by bubbling oxygen into the yeast broth, [[cell growth]] could be increased, but fermentation was inhibited&nbsp;\u2013 an observation later called the \"[[Pasteur effect]]\". In the paper \"''M\u00e9moire sur la fermentation alcoolique,''\" Pasteur proved that alcoholic fermentation was conducted by living yeasts and not by a chemical catalyst.<ref name=\"NASA\" /><ref name=\"Barnett2003\" />\n\nBy the late 18th century two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified: ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' (top-fermenting yeast) and ''[[Saccharomyces carlsbergensis|S.&nbsp;carlsbergensis]]'' (bottom-fermenting yeast). ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' has been sold commercially by the Dutch for bread-making since 1780; while, around 1800, the Germans started producing ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' in the form of cream. In 1825, a method was developed to remove the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks.<ref name=Klieger2004/> The industrial production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the [[filter press]] in 1867. In 1872, Baron Max de Springer developed a manufacturing process to create granulated yeast, a technique that was used until the first World War.<ref name=\"urlLe Comit\u00e9 des Fabricants de levure&nbsp;\u2014 COFALEC&nbsp;\u2014 repr\u00e9sente les fabricants\"/> In the United States, naturally occurring airborne yeasts were used almost exclusively until commercial yeast was marketed at the [[Centennial Exposition]] in 1876 in Philadelphia, where [[Charles L. Fleischmann]] exhibited the product and a process to use it, as well as serving the resultant baked bread.<ref name=Snodgrass2004/>\n\nThe [[refrigeration|mechanical refrigerator]] (first patented in the 1850s in Europe) liberated [[Brewing|brewers]] and [[winemakers]] from seasonal constraints for the first time and allowed them to exit cellars and other earthen environments. For [[John Molson]], who made his livelihood in [[Montreal]] prior to the development of the fridge, the brewing season lasted from September through to May. The same seasonal restrictions formerly governed the [[distiller]]'s art.<ref name=jm/>\n\n== Nutrition and growth ==\nYeasts are [[chemoorganotroph]]s, as they use [[organic compound]]s as a source of energy and do not require sunlight to grow. Carbon is obtained mostly from [[hexose]] sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], or disaccharides such as [[sucrose]] and [[maltose]]. Some species can metabolize [[pentose]] sugars such as ribose,<ref name=Barnett1975/> alcohols, and [[organic acid]]s. Yeast species either require oxygen for aerobic [[cellular respiration]] ([[obligate aerobe]]s) or are anaerobic, but also have aerobic methods of energy production ([[facultative anaerobe]]s). Unlike [[bacteria]], no known yeast species grow only anaerobically ([[obligate anaerobe]]s). Most yeasts grow best in a neutral or slightly acidic pH environment.\n\nYeasts vary in regard to the temperature range in which they grow best. For example, ''[[Leucosporidium frigidum]]'' grows at {{convert|-2|to|20|C|F}}, ''[[Saccharomyces telluris]]'' at {{convert|5|to|35|C|F}}, and ''[[Candida slooffi]]'' at {{convert|28|to|45|C|F}}.<ref name=Arthur1976/> The cells can survive freezing under certain conditions, with viability decreasing over time.\n\nIn general, yeasts are grown in the laboratory on solid [[growth medium|growth media]] or in liquid [[broth]]s. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include [[potato dextrose agar]] or [[potato dextrose broth]], Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient [[agar]], yeast [[peptone]] [[dextrose]] agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who cultivate yeast frequently use dried [[malt extract]] and agar as a solid growth medium. The [[fungicide]] [[cycloheximide]] is sometimes added to yeast growth media to inhibit the growth of ''[[Saccharomyces]]'' yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast species. This will change the yeast process.\n\nThe appearance of a white, thready yeast, commonly known as kahm yeast, is often a byproduct of the lactofermentation (or pickling) of certain vegetables, usually the result of exposure to air. Although harmless, it can give pickled vegetables a bad flavor and must be removed regularly during fermentation.<ref name=Kaufmann2002/>\n\n== Ecology ==\nYeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or [[peach]]es), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects.<ref name=Suh2005/><ref name=Slavikova2003/> The ecological function and [[biodiversity]] of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=Herrera2002/> Yeasts, including ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula]] rubra'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', have been found living in between people's toes as part of their [[skin flora]].<ref name=Oyeka2002/> Yeasts are also present in the [[gut flora]] of mammals and some insects<ref name=Martini1992/> and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.<ref name=Bass2007/><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kutty SN, Philip R | url = http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/purl/2035/Marine%20yeasts-a%20rewiew.pdf| doi = 10.1002/yea.1599 | title = Marine yeasts\u2014a review | journal = Yeast | volume = 25 | issue = 7 | pages = 465\u2013483| year = 2008 | pmid = 18615863}}</ref>\n\nAn Indian study of seven [[honey bee|bee]] species and nine plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonize the [[nectaries]] of flowers and honey stomachs of bees.

The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread.<ref name=Little2008/>\n\nCertain strains of some species of yeasts produce proteins called yeast killer toxins that allow them to eliminate competing strains. (See main article on [[killer yeast]].) This can cause problems for winemaking but could potentially also be used to advantage by using killer toxin-producing strains to make the wine. Yeast killer toxins may also have medical applications in treating yeast infections (see \"Pathogenic yeasts\" section below).<ref name=\"Magliani 2005\"/>\n\nMarine yeasts, defined as the yeasts that are isolated from marine environments, are able to grow better on a medium prepared using seawater rather than freshwater.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The first marine yeasts were isolated by Bernhard Fischer in 1894 from the Atlantic Ocean, and those were identified as ''Torula'' sp. and ''Mycoderma'' sp.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal |last1=Kutty |first1=Sreedevi N. |last2=Philip |first2=Rosamma |title=Marine yeasts\u2014a review |journal=Yeast |date=July 2008 |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=465\u2013483 |doi=10.1002/yea.1599|pmid=18615863 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/43045e354f2f146a9e2b92c558ea664c34913e1f }}</ref> Following this discovery, various other marine yeasts have been isolated from around the world from different sources, including seawater, seaweeds, marine fish and mammals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zaky |first1=Abdelrahman Saleh |last2=Greetham |first2=Darren |last3=Louis |first3=Edward J. |last4=Tucker |first4=Greg A. |last5=Du |first5=Chenyu |title=A New Isolation and Evaluation Method for Marine-Derived Yeast spp. with Potential Applications in Industrial Biotechnology |journal=Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology |date=28 November 2016 |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1891\u20131907 |doi=10.4014/jmb.1605.05074|pmid=27435537 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/33da101fa646caf8f2693cd34232f018e8cfc2e3 }}</ref> Among these isolates, some marine yeasts originated from terrestrial habitats (grouped as facultative marine yeast), which were brought to and survived in marine environments.

The most common mode of vegetative growth in yeast is asexual reproduction by [[budding]],<ref name=Balasubramanian/> where a small bud (also known as a [[Bleb (cell biology)|bleb]] or daughter cell) is formed on the parent cell. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the parent cell splits into a daughter nucleus and migrates into the daughter cell. The bud then continues to grow until it separates from the parent cell, forming a new cell.<ref name=Yeong2005/> The daughter cell produced during the budding process is generally smaller than the mother cell. Some yeasts, including ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', reproduce by [[Fission (biology)|fission]] instead of budding,<ref name=Balasubramanian/> and thereby creating two identically sized daughter cells.\n\nIn general, under high-stress conditions such as [[nutrient]] starvation, [[haploid]] cells will die; under the same conditions, however, [[diploid]] cells can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction ([[meiosis]]) and producing a variety of haploid [[spore]]s, which can go on to [[mating of yeast|mate]] (conjugate), reforming the diploid.<ref name=Neiman2005/>\n\nThe haploid fission yeast ''Schizosaccharomyces pombe'' is a [[facultative]] sexual microorganism that can undergo mating when nutrients are limiting.<ref name=\"pmid26447128\"/><ref name=\"Davey 1998\"/> Exposure of ''S. pombe'' to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating and the formation of meiotic spores.<ref name=\"Bernstein 1989\"/> The budding yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but when starved, this yeast undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores.<ref name=\"Herskowitz 1988\"/> Haploid cells may then reproduce asexually by mitosis. Katz Ezov et al.<ref name=\"Katz 2010\"/> presented evidence that in natural ''S. cerevisiae'' populations clonal reproduction and selfing (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. In nature, mating of haploid cells to form diploid cells is most often between members of the same clonal population and [[Outcrossing|out-crossing]] is uncommon.<ref name=\"Ruderfer 2006\"/> Analysis of the ancestry of natural ''S. cerevisiae'' strains led to the conclusion that out-crossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions.<ref name=\"Ruderfer 2006\"/> These observations suggest that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are likely to be insufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removal of citation referring to predatory publisher content}}  Rather, a short-term benefit, such as recombinational repair during meiosis,<ref name=Birdsell>{{cite book|vauthors=Birdsell JA, Wills C |date=2003 |title=The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models |series=Evolutionary Biology Series >> Evolutionary Biology |volume=33 |pages=27\u2013137 |veditors=MacIntyre RJ, Clegg MT |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0306472619}}</ref> may be the key to the maintenance of sex in ''S. cerevisiae''.\n\nSome [[Pucciniomycotina|pucciniomycete]] yeasts, in particular species of ''[[Sporidiobolus]]'' and ''[[Sporobolomyces]]'', produce aerially dispersed, asexual [[ballistospore|ballistoconidia]].<ref name=Bai2002/>\n\n== Uses ==\nThe useful physiological properties of yeast have led to their use in the field of [[biotechnology]].

Beverages such as mead, wine, beer, or [[distilled beverage|distilled spirits]] all use yeast at some stage of their production. A distilled beverage is a beverage containing ethanol that has been purified by [[distillation]]. Carbohydrate-containing plant material is fermented by yeast, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]] are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol are collected in the condensate, including water, [[ester]]s, and other alcohols, which (in addition to that provided by the oak in which it may be aged) account for the [[flavour]] of the beverage.\n\n{{anchor|top-fermenting|bottom-fermenting}}\n\n===={{anchor|Beer}}Beer ====\n{{Main|Brewing}}\n{{see also|Barm}}\n[[File:NM.0019545 J\u00e4stkrans.jpg|thumb|[[Yeast ring]] used by Swedish farmhouse brewers in the 19th century to preserve yeast between brewing sessions.]]<!-- This section is linked from [[Swedish beer]], [[Brewer's yeast]], [[Brewers yeast]], [[Brewing yeast]], [[Brewing Yeast]], [[Brewer's Yeast]], and [[Brewers' yeast]] -->\n[[File:2009-03-21 Beer brewing bubbles.jpg|right|thumb|Bubbles of [[carbon dioxide]] forming during beer-brewing<ref name=\"Ostergaard 2000\"/>]]\nBrewing yeasts may be classed as \"top-cropping\" (or \"top-fermenting\") and \"bottom-cropping\" (or \"bottom-fermenting\").<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Priest FG, Stewart GG |date=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIYbNdrIsPEC&pg=PA84 |page=84 |publisher=CRC Press |title=Handbook of Brewing|isbn=9781420015171 }}</ref> Top-cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the [[wort]] during fermentation.

An example of bottom-cropping yeast is ''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'', formerly known as ''S.&nbsp;carlsbergensis''.\n\nDecades ago,{{vague|date=March 2018}} taxonomists reclassified ''S.&nbsp;carlsbergensis'' (uvarum) as a member of ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'', noting that the only distinct difference between the two is metabolic.

Top- and bottom-cropping and cold- and warm-fermenting distinctions are largely generalizations used by laypersons to communicate to the general public.<ref>For more on the taxonomical differences, see {{cite book |author=Dowhanick TM |chapter=Yeast&nbsp;\u2013 Strains and Handling Techniques |title=The Practical Brewer |editor=McCabe JT |publisher=Master Brewers Association of the Americas |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast.<ref name=AmendolaRees2002/> Brewer's yeast is also very rich in [[essential mineral]]s and the [[B vitamin]]s (except B<sub>12</sub>).<ref name=\"urlUMMC\"/> However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time possible; brewing yeast strains act more slowly but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).\n\n''[[Dekkera/Brettanomyces]]'' is a genus of yeast known for its important role in the production of '[[lambic]]' and specialty [[sour ale]]s, along with the secondary conditioning of a particular Belgian [[Trappist beer]].<ref name=Vanderhaegen2003/> The taxonomy of the genus ''Brettanomyces'' has been debated since its early discovery and has seen many reclassifications over the years. Early classification was based on a few species that reproduced asexually (anamorph form) through multipolar budding.<ref name=Custers1940/> Shortly after, the formation of ascospores was observed and the genus ''Dekkera'', which reproduces sexually (teleomorph form), was introduced as part of the taxonomy.<ref name=VanderWalt1984/> The current taxonomy includes five species within the genera of ''Dekkera/Brettanomyces''. Those are the anamorphs ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces anomalus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces custersianus]]'', ''[[Brettanomyces naardenensis]]'', and ''[[Brettanomyces nanus]]'', with teleomorphs existing for the first two species, ''[[Dekkera bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Dekkera anomala]]''.<ref name=Oelofse2008/> The distinction between ''Dekkera'' and ''Brettanomyces'' is arguable, with Oelofse et al. (2008) citing Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira from 2006 when they affirmed that current molecular DNA detection techniques have uncovered no variance between the anamorph and teleomorph states. Over the past decade, ''Brettanomyces'' spp. have seen an increasing use in the craft-brewing sector of the industry, with a handful of breweries having produced beers that were primarily fermented with pure cultures of ''Brettanomyces'' spp. This has occurred out of experimentation, as very little information exists regarding pure culture fermentative capabilities and the aromatic compounds produced by various strains. ''Dekkera''/''Brettanomyces'' spp. have been the subjects of numerous studies conducted over the past century, although a majority of the recent research has focused on enhancing the knowledge of the wine industry. Recent research on eight ''Brettanomyces'' strains available in the brewing industry focused on strain-specific fermentations and identified the major compounds produced during pure culture anaerobic fermentation in wort.<ref name=Yakobson2010/>\n\n==== Wine ====\n{{Main|Yeast in winemaking}}\n[[File:Schramsberg Vineyards, July 2019-7609.jpg|thumb|Yeast in a bottle during sparkling wine production at [[Schramsberg Vineyards]], Napa]]\nYeast is used in [[winemaking]], where it converts the sugars present ([[glucose]] and [[fructose]]) in [[grape juice]] ([[must]]) into ethanol. Yeast is normally already present on grape skins. [[Fermentation (wine)|Fermentation]] can be done with this endogenous \"wild yeast\",<ref name =Ross/> but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact types of yeast species present. For this reason, a pure yeast culture is usually added to the must; this yeast quickly dominates the fermentation. The wild yeasts are repressed, which ensures a reliable and predictable fermentation.<ref name=Gonzalez/>\n\nMost added wine yeasts are strains of ''S. cerevisiae'', though not all strains of the species are suitable.<ref name=Gonzalez/> Different ''S.&nbsp;cerevisiae'' yeast strains have differing physiological and fermentative properties, therefore the actual strain of yeast selected can have a direct impact on the finished wine.<ref name=Dunn/> Significant research has been undertaken into the development of novel wine yeast strains that produce atypical flavour profiles or increased complexity in wines.<ref name=YeastRef14/><ref name=McBryde/>\n\nThe growth of some yeasts, such as ''[[Zygosaccharomyces]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces]]'', in wine can result in [[wine fault]]s and subsequent spoilage.<ref name=Loureiro2003/> ''Brettanomyces'' produces an array of [[metabolite]]s when growing in wine, some of which are volatile [[phenol]]ic compounds. Together, these compounds are often referred to as \"''Brettanomyces'' character\", and are often described as \"[[antiseptic]]\" or \"barnyard\" type aromas. ''Brettanomyces'' is a significant contributor to wine faults within the wine industry.<ref name=YeastRef15/>\n\nResearchers from the [[University of British Columbia]], Canada, have found a new strain of yeast that has reduced [[amine]]s. The amines in [[Wine color|red wine]] and [[Chardonnay]] produce off-flavors and cause headaches and hypertension in some people. About 30% of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as [[histamine]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Eureka!

This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air pockets \"set\", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeasts. Most yeasts used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, ''Saccharomyces exiguus'' (also known as ''S.&nbsp;minor''), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this evaporates during baking.<ref name=\"MooreLandecker1996p533-534\"/>\n\n[[File:Compressed fresh yeast - 1.jpg|right|thumb|A block of compressed fresh yeast]]\nIt is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread. The first records that show this use came from [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name=Legras2007/> Researchers speculate a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the [[flour]] caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the normal flat, hard cake.\n\n[[File:Dry yeast.jpg|thumb|right|Active dried yeast, a granulated form in which yeast is commercially sold]]\nToday, there are several retailers of baker's yeast; one of the earlier developments in North America is [[Fleischmann's Yeast]], in 1868. During World War II, Fleischmann's developed a [[wikt:granulate|granulated]] active dry yeast which did not require refrigeration, had a longer [[shelf life]] than fresh yeast, and rose twice as fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square \"cake\". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A weak solution of water and sugar can be used to determine whether yeast is expired. In the solution, active yeast will foam and bubble as it ferments the sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some recipes refer to this as [[Proofing (baking technique)|proofing]] the yeast, as it \"proves\" (tests) the viability of the yeast before the other ingredients are added. When a [[sourdough]] starter is used, flour and water are added instead of sugar; this is referred to as proofing the [[Sponge and dough|sponge]].{{Citation needed|reason='Reliable sources needed for the whole paragraph, also maybe some irrelevant information for an WP article'|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhen yeast is used for making bread, it is mixed with [[flour]], salt, and warm water or milk. The dough is [[Kneading|kneaded]] until it is smooth, and then left to rise, sometimes until it has doubled in size. The dough is then shaped into loaves. Some bread doughs are knocked back after one rising and left to rise again (this is called [[proofing (baking technique)|dough proofing]]) and then baked. A longer rising time gives a better flavor, but the yeast can fail to raise the bread in the final stages if it is left for too long initially.\n\n=== Bioremediation ===\nSome yeasts can find potential application in the field of [[bioremediation]]. One such yeast, ''[[Yarrowia lipolytica]]'', is known to degrade [[palm oil]] mill [[effluent]], [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (an explosive material), and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, such as [[alkane]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, fats and oils.<ref name=\"Zinjard 2014\"/> It can also tolerate high concentrations of salt and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]],<ref name=Bankar2009rev/> and is being investigated for its potential as a heavy metal [[Biosorption|biosorbent]].<ref name=Bankar2009/> ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' has potential to bioremediate toxic pollutants like [[arsenic]] from industrial effluent.<ref name=\"Soares 2012\"/> Bronze statues are known to be degraded by certain species of yeast.<ref name=\"Cappitelli 2008\"/> Different yeasts from Brazilian gold mines [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] free and [[Coordination complex|complexed]] silver ions.<ref name=\"Singh 2006\"/>\n\n=== Industrial ethanol production ===\n{{See also|Biofuel#Bioalcohols|label 1=Bioethanol}}\nThe ability of yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been harnessed by the biotechnology industry to produce [[ethanol fuel]]. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as [[sugar cane]], [[field corn]], or other [[cereal grain]]s, and then adding dilute [[sulfuric acid]], or fungal alpha [[amylase]] enzymes, to break down the starches into complex sugars. A glucoamylase is then added to break the complex sugars down into simple sugars. After this, yeasts are added to convert the simple sugars to ethanol, which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol up to 96% in purity.<ref name=\"YeastRef4\"/>\n\n''Saccharomyces'' yeasts have been [[genetically engineered]] to ferment [[xylose]], one of the major fermentable sugars present in [[Lignocellulosic biomass|cellulosic biomasses]], such as agriculture residues, paper wastes, and wood chips.<ref name=AEM/><ref name=Ho1998/> Such a development means ethanol can be efficiently produced from more inexpensive feedstocks, making [[cellulosic ethanol]] fuel a more competitively priced alternative to gasoline fuels.<ref name=\"Madhavan 2012\"/>\n\n=== Nonalcoholic beverages ===\n[[File:Kombucha jar.jpg|thumb|right|A ''[[kombucha]]'' culture fermenting in a jar]]\n[[File:Kombuchacultsm.jpg|thumb|Yeast and bacteria in kombucha at 400\u00d7]]\nA number of sweet [[soft drink|carbonated beverages]] can be produced by the same methods as beer, except the fermentation is stopped sooner, producing carbon dioxide, but only trace amounts of alcohol, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar in the drink.\n* '''[[Root beer]]''', originally made by Native Americans, commercialized in the United States by [[Charles Elmer Hires]] and especially popular during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]\n* '''[[Kvass]]''', a fermented drink made from [[rye]], popular in Eastern Europe.

It is often referred to as \"[[nutritional yeast]]\" when sold as a dietary supplement. Nutritional yeast is a deactivated yeast, usually ''S. &nbsp;cerevisiae''. It is naturally low in fat and [[sodium]] as well as an excellent source of protein and vitamins, especially most [[Vitamin B|B-complex]] vitamins<ref name=\"Thaler 2014\"/> (contrary to some claims, it contains little or no vitamin B<sub>12</sub><ref name=\"urlUMMC\"/> ), as well as other minerals and [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] required for growth. Some brands of nutritional yeast, though not all, are fortified with [[Cyanocobalamin|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], which is produced separately by [[bacteria]].<ref name=\"Duyff 2012\"/>\n\nIn 1920, the [[Fleischmann's Yeast|Fleischmann Yeast Company]] began to promote yeast cakes in a \"Yeast for Health\" campaign. They initially emphasized yeast as a source of vitamins, good for skin and digestion. Their later advertising claimed a much broader range of health benefits, and was censured as misleading by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. The [[fad]] for yeast cakes lasted until the late 1930s.<ref name=Yeast>{{cite journal|author1=Price C|title=The healing power of compressed yeast|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=17\u201323|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-healing-power-of-compressed-yeast|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nNutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy flavor and is often used as an ingredient in cheese substitutes. Another popular use is as a topping for popcorn. It can also be used in mashed and fried potatoes, as well as in [[scrambled egg]]s. It comes in the form of flakes, or as a yellow powder similar in texture to [[cornmeal]]. In Australia, it is sometimes sold as \"savoury yeast flakes\". Though \"nutritional yeast\" usually refers to commercial products, inadequately fed prisoners have used \"home-grown\" yeast to prevent vitamin deficiency.<ref name=\"YeastRef8\"/>\n\n=== Probiotics ===\nSome [[probiotic]] supplements use the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces boulardii|S.&nbsp;boulardii]]'' to maintain and restore the natural flora in the [[gastrointestinal tract]].

This triggers [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]], wherein the yeast's [[digestion|digestive]] enzymes break their own [[protein]]s down into simpler compounds, a process of self-destruction. The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, after which the husks (yeast with thick cell walls that would give poor texture) are separated. Yeast autolysates are used in [[Vegemite]] and [[Promite]] (Australia); [[Marmite]] (the United Kingdom); the unrelated [[Marmite (New Zealand)|Marmite]] (New Zealand); [[Vitam-R]] (Germany); and [[Cenovis]] ([[Switzerland]]).\n\n=== Scientific research ===\n[[File:Yeast cell english.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing a yeast cell]]\nSeveral yeasts, in particular ''[[S.&nbsp;cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[S. pombe]]'', have been widely used in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are simple [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, serving as a model for all eukaryotes, including humans, for the study of fundamental cellular processes such as the [[cell cycle]], [[DNA replication]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], [[cell division]], and metabolism. Also, yeasts are easily manipulated and cultured in the laboratory, which has allowed for the development of powerful standard techniques, such as [[yeast two-hybrid]],<ref name=\"Br\u00fcckner 2009\"/> [[synthetic genetic array]] analysis,<ref name=\"Tong 2006\"/> and [[tetrad (genetics)|tetrad analysis]].

Although Duterte was open to the idea of having the pageant hosted by the Philippines, he did not want the government to pay the expense of doing so (but a government spokesperson later said that some \"services\" would be provided for the event).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe coronation night in 2017|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/07/28/1607565/philippines-host-miss-universe-coronation-night-2017|accessdate=July 29, 2016|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cnnphiltohost\">{{cite news|last1=Montano|first1=Isabella|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe 2016|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2016/07/28/Miss-Universe-2016-Philippines.html|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=CNN Philippines|date=July 29, 2016}}</ref>  About two weeks after the meeting, the Department of Tourism announced that the Philippines would be the host.  A spokesperson for the Department said that, according to Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart, the Philippines was the organization's prime choice for hosting the pageant, although other countries were being considered.<ref name=\"cnnphiltohost\"/>\n\nDespite the statement made by the Department of Tourism, the final decision to hold the pageant in the Philippines had not yet been made and, over the next few months, the Miss Universe Organization had changed its mind several times on the matter.  Initial reports did not disclose the reasons for the breakdowns in negotiations, but a later report linked the Organization's concerns with Duterte's controversial remarks regarding U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], as well as his plans to separate ties between the Philippines and the United States.  These statements were not received well by the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Entertainment/International Marketing Group]] (WME), the owners of the Miss Universe franchise. Duterte's statement that he would be glad to kill as many drug addicts as [[Adolf Hitler]] killed Jews during the [[Holocaust]] led to WME executive Ziv Emanuel (brother of [[Rahm Emanuel]]) to cancel the talks.  [[Ilocos Sur]] governor [[Chavit Singson]], who was also chairman of the LCS Group, sent representatives, including some Jewish friends, to the United States to persuade Emanuel to maintain his interest in a Philippines-hosted event. Duterte's later apology for his Holocaust-related remark helped in the renegotiation.  Also helpful was Singson's offer to add women-empowerment programs to the pageant.<ref name=\"reallyhappen\">{{cite news|last1=Enriquez|first1=Marge|title=Chavit Singson: What really happened behind the scenes of Miss U|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/246331/chavit-singson-really-happened-behind-scenes-miss-u/|accessdate=December 6, 2016|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flores|first1=Karen|title=Did you know?

Although Duterte was open to the idea of having the pageant hosted by the Philippines, he did not want the government to pay the expense of doing so (but a government spokesperson later said that some \"services\" would be provided for the event).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe coronation night in 2017|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/07/28/1607565/philippines-host-miss-universe-coronation-night-2017|accessdate=July 29, 2016|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=July 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cnnphiltohost\">{{cite news|last1=Montano|first1=Isabella|title=Philippines to host Miss Universe 2016|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/lifestyle/2016/07/28/Miss-Universe-2016-Philippines.html|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=CNN Philippines|date=July 29, 2016}}</ref>  About two weeks after the meeting, the Department of Tourism announced that the Philippines would be the host.  A spokesperson for the Department said that, according to Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart, the Philippines was the organization's prime choice for hosting the pageant, although other countries were being considered.<ref name=\"cnnphiltohost\"/>\n\nDespite the statement made by the Department of Tourism, the final decision to hold the pageant in the Philippines had not yet been made and, over the next few months, the Miss Universe Organization had changed its mind several times on the matter.  Initial reports did not disclose the reasons for the breakdowns in negotiations, but a later report linked the Organization's concerns with Duterte's controversial remarks regarding U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], as well as his plans to separate ties between the Philippines and the United States.  These statements were not received well by the [[William Morris Endeavor|William Morris Entertainment/International Marketing Group]] (WME), the owners of the Miss Universe franchise. Duterte's statement that he would be glad to kill as many drug addicts as [[Adolf Hitler]] killed Jews during the [[Holocaust]] led to WME executive Ziv Emanuel (brother of [[Rahm Emanuel]]) to cancel the talks.  [[Ilocos Sur]] governor [[Chavit Singson]], who was also chairman of the LCS Group, sent representatives, including some Jewish friends, to the United States to persuade Emanuel to maintain his interest in a Philippines-hosted event. Duterte's later apology for his Holocaust-related remark helped in the renegotiation.  Also helpful was Singson's offer to add women-empowerment programs to the pageant.<ref name=\"reallyhappen\">{{cite news|last1=Enriquez|first1=Marge|title=Chavit Singson: What really happened behind the scenes of Miss U|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/246331/chavit-singson-really-happened-behind-scenes-miss-u/|accessdate=December 6, 2016|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=December 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flores|first1=Karen|title=Did you know?

However, as when the pageant concluded, she went home unplaced. The organization responsible for sending a delegate to Miss Earth was a different organization in 2002 and in 2003. It was in 2007 when Agnesa Vuthaj acquired the franchise and sent Miss Kosovo 2007 winner, [[Yllka Berisha]], to [[Miss Earth 2008]]. However, she was unable to grab a spot in the semifinals as well. In 2014, Kaltrina Neziri was supposed to compete for Miss Earth but her visa was denied and was not able to compete. The organizer decided that she would compete for the following year, instead.

She is the first delegate from Kosovo to join in a [[Big Four international beauty pageants|major beauty pageant]] while Kosovo was still then part of [[Yugoslavia]] or [[Serbia]]. However, as when the pageant concluded, she went home unplaced. The organization responsible for sending a delegate to Miss Earth was a different organization in 2002 and in 2003. It was in 2007 when Agnesa Vuthaj acquired the franchise and sent Miss Kosovo 2007 winner, [[Yllka Berisha]], to [[Miss Earth 2008]]. However, she was unable to grab a spot in the semifinals as well. In 2014, Kaltrina Neziri was supposed to compete for Miss Earth but her visa was denied and was not able to compete. The organizer decided that she would compete for the following year, instead. To date, there is yet a Kosovan delegate to place in the Miss Earth pageant. One of the runners-up of Miss Kosovo represents her country at [[Miss Earth]].''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"5\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 92%; text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#787878\" colspan=10 align=\"center\"\n|width=\"60\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Year</span>\n|width=\"230\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Municipality</span>\n|width=\"250\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Miss Earth Kosovo</span>\n|width=\"250\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Placement at Miss Earth</span>\n|width=\"230\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Special Awards</span>\n|width=\"290\"|<span style=\"color:white\">Notes</span>\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2016|2016]]\n| [[Gjakova]]\n| Andina Pura\n| Did not compete\n| \n|\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2015|2015]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| [[Kaltrina Neziri]]<ref name=wona>{{cite news|last=|first=|title=\nKaltrina e Agnesa, drejt \u2018Miss Earth\u2019 dhe \u2018Miss Universe\u2019 (in Albanian)|url=http://www.gazetatribuna.com/?FaqeID=5&LajmID=85587|accessdate=12 October 2014|newspaper=Tribuna|year=2014}}</ref>\n| Unplaced\n| {{bronze03}} Evening Gown Competition\n| {{n/a|Allocated to 2015, she was crowned in 2014}}\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2014|2014]]\n| colspan=5 {{n/a|Did not compete}}\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2013|2013]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| [[Donika Emini]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegrafi.com/magazina/mirjeta-shala-dhe-donika-emini-jane-fituese-ne-miss-kosova-2013-6-19879.html |title=Mirjeta Shala dhe Donika Emini jan\u00eb fituese n\u00eb \u2018Miss Kosova 2013\u2019 |publisher=telegrafi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821192438/http://www.telegrafi.com/magazina/mirjeta-shala-dhe-donika-emini-jane-fituese-ne-miss-kosova-2013-6-19879.html |archive-date=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n| Unplaced\n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2012|2012]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| Aj\u0161e Babatinca \n| Unplaced\n|\n|\n|- \n| [[Miss Earth 2011|2011]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| Nora Asani\n| Unplaced  \n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2010|2010]]\n| [[Pe\u0107|Pej\u00eb]]\n| Morena Taraku\n| Unplaced  \n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2009|2009]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| Elsa Marku \n| Unplaced \n|\n|\n|- \n| [[Miss Earth 2008|2008]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| [[Yllka Berisha]] \n| Unplaced \n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=6 {{n/a|Did not compete between 2004\u20142007}}\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2003|2003]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| Teuta Hod\u017ea \n| Unplaced  \n|\n|\n|-\n| [[Miss Earth 2002|2002]]\n| [[Pristina]]\n| Mirjeta Zeka\n| Unplaced \n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n==Notes==\nIn 2013 the former Miss Universe Kosovo team pulled out of Miss Universe and decided to send their winning girl to Miss World 2013.
