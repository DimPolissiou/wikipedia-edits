The ratio has been climbing higher ever since it was at 15.9 in 2005 (except during the times of the [[Great Recession|2008-2009 Recession]]).

The town's black school, [[Booker T. Washington High School (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|Booker T Washington]], also had a football program, but records on it are hard to find.\n\nEd Dubie was head football coach from 1937-1938 and later had the school's field house named after him.\n\nLester Secrest was head football coach from 1944-1946 and lead the Sandites to their first district title in 1944.\n\nMaurice Hail took over in 1947 and led the Sandites to district titles in 1948 and 1951. In 1951, the Sandites made it to the state semi-finals and tied Ada 20-20, but victory was awarded to Ada due to more penetrations.\n\nIn 1952 Cecil Hankins took over and led the Sandites to another district title but lost 27-9 to Ponca City on Thanksgiving morning in the first round of the playoffs. In 1954, Jerry Adair played QB on Hankins team. He lettered 9 times in 3 sports in his career at Sand Springs High School, and turned down a position on the All-State football team in hopes that he would be offered a spot on the All-State basketball team, which he was. He went on to earn a spot in the Oklahoma State University Basketball Hall of Fame. He went on to play Major League Baseball for the Orioles.\n\nCharles Prigmore coached from 1957-1960 and was the first head coach at the new Charles Page High School.\n\nTravis Rhodes took up the reins from 1961-1962 and led Charles Page to an undefeated season in 1962, but they were unable to compete in the playoffs because they weren't in an eligible conference.\n\nFrank Tillery coached from 1964-1966 and in 1966 led them to their first and only state title in Class 2A. Quarterback Jackie Hill took them 12-0 and also landed a district title. On October 21, they upset the #1 ranked Broken Arrow and earned the #1 spot for themselves. They settled their 1951 score against Ada with a 37-26 win, then confronted El Reno in the final round. The game was played at Taft Stadium in Oklahoma City on an icy field in December. It was so cold that day that the cheerleaders and fans were burning fires in trashcans for warmth. At one point, football player Arlie Christmas accidentally set his leg on fire, briefly, without injury. David Treadwell, however, was not without injury and left the game with a broken arm. The Sandites won the game 14-7. A road through the Charles Page campus was named after Frank Tillery.\n\nAD James (1976-1979) gave Charles Page her first back to back district titles in 76 and 77.\n\nPage's longest tenured coach is LD Bains who coached from 1983-1996. In 1987 the Sandites shared a district title with Stillwater and Bartlesville and ended 10-3 after defeating Memorial and Norman in the playoffs before falling 14-10 to Lawton in the third round. The took another run at the championship in 1990 and entered the playoffs 7-3 after an impressive season including three shutouts, one of which was against sixth ranked Stillwater. They defeated #10 Union and #9 Jenks before falling to Putnam North in the third round of the playoffs, finishing the season ranked fifth. The Sandites made four more playoff appearances under Bains, but never made it past the first round.\n\nIn 1997, LD Bains retired and Archie Loehr took over, leading the Sandites to a perfect regular season with a district title, a victory over #2 Stillwater, and three shutouts. They scored playoff wins against #7 Broken Arrow and #11 Sapulpa before falling 10-7 against Yukon, their only defeat of the season.\n\nThe Sandites then entered a dark spell, going 3-7 under Mark Baetz in 2001, then 0-10 two consecutive seasons under Tim Beacham. In 2004, head coach Brad Odom broke the 28 game losing streak with a 58-6 win over Central.\n\nThe Sandites posted four consecutive 4-6 seasons from 2004-2007. In 2007, much was expected from the Sandites. Current head coach Dustin Kinard took over and Sophomore Quarterback Johnny Deaton took the helm. 2007 was also the first season in the newly remodeled Memorial Stadium. Deaton was covered as one of the top QBs in the state, despite the team only going 4-6. In 2008, the Sandites made the playoffs for the first time in 10 years and went 6-4 before losing to Union in the playoffs. The Sandites had their highest scoring season of all time, averaging 35.81 points per game under Deaton, but a terrible defense that allowed 36 points per game negated any real chance the team had at a state title. 2009 was expected to be Charles Page's year, but Deaton broke his collarbone in the opening game and missed half the season. That and a game that was won on the field but forfeited due to an ineligible player led to a disappointing 4-6 season. Deaton went on to [[Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]] on a scholarship and was the backup Quarterback before transferring to [[Northeastern State University|Northeastern State University]] where he started.\n\nIn 2012, star Quarterback Cody Hale led the Sandites to their winningest season in 15 years with an 8-2 record. The Sandites lost in the first round of the playoffs to Broken Arrow. Hale returned to the starting position his Senior year and led the Sandites to a 6-4 season. The Sandites hosted Westmoore at home and lost 31-10. The Tulsa World ranked Cody Hale as the best QB in the area. Hale also pitched for the Sandites and was clocked at 94 MPH during a spring baseball trip to Arizona. He was also selected for the All-State football team.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association|OSSAA]] split class 6A into two divisions, each with their own playoffs and state title. The Sandites fell into the smaller, new, Class 6A-II. The Sandites entered the season with high hopes at a shot for a district or state title now that they wouldn't have to go up against The Big Four. The regular season left the Sandites with a 7-3 record with two shutouts and a 63-6 win against Nathan Hale which tied for their second highest scoring game of all time. With District losses to Booker T Washington and Bixby, the Sandites came in third in district and qualified for the playoffs for the third-straight year. A 28-17 OT win at Midwest City sent Sand Springs to the semi-finals for the first time since 1997 where they lost 41-14 to Bixby.\n\nIn 2015, the Sandites won two of their non-district season-openers just to forfeit them due to playing an ineligible transfer student. Their third game was cancelled at half time due to lightning after having already been postponed two hours. They were leading Guthrie 18-6 at the time it was called off. Sand Springs registered only two true loses in the regular season, to Bartlesville and Booker T Washington. In the quarterfinals Sand Springs dominated Stillwater, then narrowly upset undefeated #1 Booker T Washington in the semi-finals for their first Championship appearance since 1966. This time, Bixby won the rematch and defended their state title.\n\n==Athletic complex==\n\nCharles Page High School has an extensive athletic complex that includes tennis courts, an indoor basketball arena, a baseball field, a football stadium, and one and a half football practice fields.\n\nAt the end of the 2006 football season, Charles Page's football stadium, Memorial Stadium, was demolished. Construction of the new Memorial Stadium started in the early winter of 2007. The field itself and bleachers were completed for the start of the 2007 football season, while the stadium facilities such as restrooms, locker rooms, and concession stands were completed mid season. The original stadium was built in 1948-1949 to replace the older Dubie Field that was located at 2nd and Washington in Sand Springs<ref>https://www.scoreboards.net/articles/charles-page-high-school-memorial-stadium-a-stadium-that-almost-wasn\u2019t/</ref>.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Sand Springs citizens passed a bond issue that will provide renovations to the current Ed Dubie fieldhouse as well as various other projects such as a new fine arts facility and the demolition of the pool for the eventual converting into a new wrestling facility.\n\nOn 15 March, 2019, Sand Springs citizens passed a bond measure that will provide for the re-grading of the Sandite Softball and Baseball fields, as well new turf at Memorial Stadium and sound system upgrades at the Ed Dubie Field House.<ref>https://www.sanditepride.com/local-news/190304/bond-election</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], singer<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wooley |first1=John |title=Sam I Am |url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archive/sam-i-am/article_c0ab41d7-8cb7-562b-814a-41fd78d9d0d8.html |accessdate=26 April 2019 |publisher=Tulsa World |date=April 7, 1999}}</ref>\n* [[Marques Haynes]], professional basketball player{{efn|name=CPHS|Marques Haynes actually graduated from Booker T.

Since 2005, the school has seen a rise in students by 16% <ref>https://high-schools.com/directory/ok/cities/sand-springs/charles-page-high-school/402688001405/</ref>.\n\n===Gay-Straight Alliance controversy===\nIn 2004, Charles Page High School garnered national attention with a controversy surrounding the creation of a Gay-Straight Alliance at the school. An openly gay student, Michael Shackelford, was the focus of a series of articles in the [[Washington Post]] which brought national attention to the school.<ref name=\"In the Bible Belt, Acceptance Is Hard-Won\">{{cite news | date=2004-09-26 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-bible-belt-acceptance-is-hard-won/2015/12/02/9789697a-9902-11e5-94f0-9eeaff906ef3_story.html| title=In the Bible Belt, Acceptance Is Hard-Won| publisher=Washington Post | author=Anne Hull | accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> This national attention caught the eye of radical preacher [[Fred Phelps]] of Topeka, Kansas [[Westboro Baptist Church]] who came and protested at Charles Page in November 2004.

The town's black school, Booker T Washington, also had a football program, but records on it are hard to find.\n\nEd Dubie was head football coach from 1937-1938 and later had the school's field house named after him.\n\nLester Secrest was head football coach from 1944-1946 and lead the Sandites to their first district title in 1944.\n\nMaurice Hail took over in 1947 and led the Sandites to district titles in 1948 and 1951. In 1951, the Sandites made it to the state semi-finals and tied Ada 20-20, but victory was awarded to Ada due to more penetrations.\n\nIn 1952 Cecil Hankins took over and led the Sandites to another district title but lost 27-9 to Ponca City on Thanksgiving morning in the first round of the playoffs. In 1954, Jerry Adair played QB on Hankins team. He lettered 9 times in 3 sports in his career at Sand Springs High School, and turned down a position on the All-State football team in hopes that he would be offered a spot on the All-State basketball team, which he was. He went on to earn a spot in the Oklahoma State University Basketball Hall of Fame. He went on to play Major League Baseball for the Orioles.\n\nCharles Prigmore coached from 1957-1960 and was the first head coach at the new Charles Page High School.\n\nTravis Rhodes took up the reins from 1961-1962 and led Charles Page to an undefeated season in 1962, but they were unable to compete in the playoffs because they weren't in an eligible conference.\n\nFrank Tillery coached from 1964-1966 and in 1966 led them to their first and only state title in Class 2A. Quarterback Jackie Hill took them 12-0 and also landed a district title. On October 21, they upset the #1 ranked Broken Arrow and earned the #1 spot for themselves. They settled their 1951 score against Ada with a 37-26 win, then confronted El Reno in the final round. The game was played at Taft Stadium in Oklahoma City on an icy field in December. It was so cold that day that the cheerleaders and fans were burning fires in trashcans for warmth. At one point, football player Arlie Christmas accidentally set his leg on fire, briefly, without injury. David Treadwell, however, was not without injury and left the game with a broken arm. The Sandites won the game 14-7. A road through the Charles Page campus was named after Frank Tillery.\n\nAD James (1976-1979) gave Charles Page her first back to back district titles in 76 and 77.\n\nPage's longest tenured coach is LD Bains who coached from 1983-1996. In 1987 the Sandites shared a district title with Stillwater and Bartlesville and ended 10-3 after defeating Memorial and Norman in the playoffs before falling 14-10 to Lawton in the third round. The took another run at the championship in 1990 and entered the playoffs 7-3 after an impressive season including three shutouts, one of which was against sixth ranked Stillwater. They defeated #10 Union and #9 Jenks before falling to Putnam North in the third round of the playoffs, finishing the season ranked fifth. The Sandites made four more playoff appearances under Bains, but never made it past the first round.\n\nIn 1997, LD Bains retired and Archie Loehr took over, leading the Sandites to a perfect regular season with a district title, a victory over #2 Stillwater, and three shutouts. They scored playoff wins against #7 Broken Arrow and #11 Sapulpa before falling 10-7 against Yukon, their only defeat of the season.\n\nThe Sandites then entered a dark spell, going 3-7 under Mark Baetz in 2001, then 0-10 two consecutive seasons under Tim Beacham. In 2004, head coach Brad Odom broke the 28 game losing streak with a 58-6 win over Central.\n\nThe Sandites posted four consecutive 4-6 seasons from 2004-2007. In 2007, much was expected from the Sandites. Current head coach Dustin Kinard took over and Sophomore Quarterback Johnny Deaton took the helm. 2007 was also the first season in the newly remodeled Memorial Stadium. Deaton was covered as one of the top QBs in the state, despite the team only going 4-6. In 2008, the Sandites made the playoffs for the first time in 10 years and went 6-4 before losing to Union in the playoffs. The Sandites had their highest scoring season of all time, averaging 35.81 points per game under Deaton, but a terrible defense that allowed 36 points per game negated any real chance the team had at a state title. 2009 was expected to be Charles Page's year, but Deaton broke his collarbone in the opening game and missed half the season. That and a game that was won on the field but forfeited due to an ineligible player led to a disappointing 4-6 season. Deaton went on to Oklahoma State University on a scholarship and was the backup Quarterback before transferring to Northeastern State University where he started.\n\nIn 2012, star Quarterback Cody Hale led the Sandites to their winningest season in 15 years with an 8-2 record. The Sandites lost in the first round of the playoffs to Broken Arrow. Hale returned to the starting position his Senior year and led the Sandites to a 6-4 season. The Sandites hosted Westmoore at home and lost 31-10. The Tulsa World ranked Cody Hale as the best QB in the area. Hale also pitched for the Sandites and was clocked at 94 MPH during a spring baseball trip to Arizona. He was also selected for the All-State football team.\n\nIn 2014, the OSSAA split class 6A into two divisions, each with their own playoffs and state title. The Sandites fell into the smaller, new, Class 6A-II. The Sandites entered the season with high hopes at a shot for a district or state title now that they wouldn't have to go up against The Big Four. The regular season left the Sandites with a 7-3 record with two shutouts and a 63-6 win against Nathan Hale which tied for their second highest scoring game of all time. With District losses to Booker T Washington and Bixby, the Sandites came in third in district and qualified for the playoffs for the third-straight year. A 28-17 OT win at Midwest City sent Sand Springs to the semi-finals for the first time since 1997 where they lost 41-14 to Bixby.\n\nIn 2015, the Sandites won two of their non-district season-openers just to forfeit them due to playing an ineligible transfer student. Their third game was cancelled at half time due to lightning after having already been postponed two hours. They were leading Guthrie 18-6 at the time it was called off. Sand Springs registered only two true loses in the regular season, to Bartlesville and Booker T Washington. In the quarterfinals Sand Springs dominated Stillwater, then narrowly upset undefeated #1 Booker T Washington in the semi-finals for their first Championship appearance since 1966. This time, Bixby won the rematch and defended their state title.\n\n==Athletic complex==\n\nCharles Page High School has an extensive athletic complex that includes tennis courts, an indoor basketball arena, a baseball field, a football stadium, and one and a half football practice fields.\n\nAt the end of the 2006 football season, Charles Page's football stadium, Memorial Stadium, was demolished. Construction of the new Memorial Stadium started in the early winter of 2007. The field itself and bleachers were completed for the start of the 2007 football season, while the stadium facilities such as restrooms, locker rooms, and concession stands were completed mid season. The original stadium was built in 1948-1949 to replace the older Dubie Field that was located at 2nd and Washington in Sand Springs<ref>https://www.scoreboards.net/articles/charles-page-high-school-memorial-stadium-a-stadium-that-almost-wasn\u2019t/</ref>.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, Sand Springs citizens passed a bond issue that will provide renovations to the current Ed Dubie fieldhouse as well as various other projects such as a new fine arts facility and the demolition of the pool for the eventual converting into a new wrestling facility.\n\nOn 15 March, 2019, Sand Springs citizens passed a bond measure that will provide for the re-grading of the Sandite Softball and Baseball fields, as well new turf at Memorial Stadium and sound system upgrades at the Ed Dubie Field House.<ref>https://www.sanditepride.com/local-news/190304/bond-election</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Sam Harris (singer)|Sam Harris]], singer<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wooley |first1=John |title=Sam I Am |url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archive/sam-i-am/article_c0ab41d7-8cb7-562b-814a-41fd78d9d0d8.html |accessdate=26 April 2019 |publisher=Tulsa World |date=April 7, 1999}}</ref>\n* [[Marques Haynes]], professional basketball player{{efn|name=CPHS|Marques Haynes actually graduated from Booker T.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the Galbin region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30-degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two-thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

Russell]] and [[Dong Zhi-Ming]] described the new genus ''Alxasaurus'' from China; at the time this was the most complete large theropod from its time and place. While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong, therefore, proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher-level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

The multiple clutches indicate some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters like [[hadrosaurs]], prosauropods, [[titanosaurs]], and birds.

In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could, therefore, crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish-eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the Galbin region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the Galbin region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30-degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two-thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct.

One possibility is they dispersed through [[vicariance]], whereby therizinosaurs were present in the areas that became Asia and North America before the [[rifting]] that divided these areas in the [[Late Triassic]]. The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle [[Barremian]]; between 132\u2013138&nbsp;million years ago, a temporary [[land bridge]] connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs ''Beipiaosaurus'' from Asia and ''Falcarius'' from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid ''Nothronychus'', which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the [[Turonian]] stage of the early [[Late Cretaceous]] also shows there would have been a [[faunal interchange]] between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the [[Aptian]]/[[Albian]]), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Therizinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeletons of the North American therizinosaurs ''[[Nothronychus]]'' (large) and ''[[Falcarius]]'', in modern, bipedal postures, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]\n\nIn 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been [[Semiaquatic|amphibious]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |last2=Perle |first2=A. |author2-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Modiphikatsiy tasa sayrisziy i parallelinoe rasvitie zishchnich dinosavrov |trans-title=Modification in the saurischian pelvis and the parallel development of predatory dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=8 |pages=39\u201344|language=Russian|translator-last=Welsh |translator-first=W.

In 1970, [[Anatoly K.

Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could, therefore, crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish-eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

In ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by [[Nina Dobrev]]. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \"[[Meanness|mean girl]]\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in ''The Vampire Diaries'' television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \"the girl next door\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth season finale.\n\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires [[Stefan Salvatore]] and his older brother, [[Damon Salvatore|Damon]]. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova [[Doppelg\u00e4nger]], which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, [[Katherine Pierce]] (n\u00e9e Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an [[Instagram]] post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg\u00e4nger Katherine Pierce.\n\n==Casting and portrayal==\n{{quote box\n|quoted=true\n|width = 17em\n|align=left \n|bgcolor= white \n|border = 0px\n|fontsize = 95%\n|quote = When I look in the mirror, I just feel different when I'm Katherine or when I'm Elena.

With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1====\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\n\n====Season 2====\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood.\n\n====Season 3====\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg\u00e4ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires.\nLater, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote.\nShe unfortunately loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive being apart and get back together.\nOnce Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town.\nElena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. \nOnce Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship, Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding, Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day.\n\n====Season 7====\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybil, the Siren, luring him into a trap.\n\n====Season 8====\nIn the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to study at medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\n\n==== Post-Season 8 ====\nThe second-last episode of ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', '[[The Originals (season 5)|The Tale of Two Wolves]]', features [[List of The Originals characters|Elijah and Hope Mikaelson]] visiting Mystic Falls, and the window of a doctor's office reads 'Elena Salvatore, M.D.', showing that Elena got her own medical practice.\n\n==Reception==\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', and its protagonist [[Bella Swan]]. West said \"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two immortal vampires fighting over her\".<ref name=\"casted\" /> After she transitioned into a vampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of [[Zap2it]] hoped that the \"fierce\" and \"ripper\" side of Elena would emerge when \"someone messes with the people she loves\".<ref name=\"AT\" /> McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a vampire, \"their strongest personality traits are heightened\", and hoped that wouldn't see Elena's \"compassion and selflessness\" double into \"helping old ladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\".<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web|last=MacKenzie|first=Carina Adly|title='The Vampire Diaries' Season 4: Elena vs Katherine and 10 other things we want to see|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|work=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=24 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102111025/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|archive-date=2 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Robyn Ross of ''[[TV Guide]]'' also hoped that after Elena \"has had a taste for blood\", she would lose control.

In ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, she is portrayed by [[Nina Dobrev]]. In the books, Elena was blonde, popular, selfish and a \"[[Meanness|mean girl]]\". However the show's producers, Julie Plec and [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], felt that it wasn't the direction they wanted to go with their heroine in ''The Vampire Diaries'' television series. Instead, she became a nicer, relatable and more of \"the girl next door\" type, until her life gets flipped upside down when she meets the Salvatore Brothers. In April 2015, Nina Dobrev announced that she would be departing the series after the sixth season finale.\n\nMuch of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires [[Stefan Salvatore]] and his older brother, [[Damon Salvatore|Damon]]. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova [[Doppelg\u00e4nger]], which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, [[Katherine Pierce]] (n\u00e9e Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and dies then deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, then relocated to a warehouse in Brooklyn, New York in the seventh season, then back to Mystic Falls. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an [[Instagram]] post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelg\u00e4nger Katherine Pierce.\n\n==Casting and portrayal==\n{{quote box\n|quoted=true\n|width = 17em\n|align=left \n|bgcolor= white \n|border = 0px\n|fontsize = 95%\n|quote = When I look in the mirror, I just feel different when I'm Katherine or when I'm Elena.

With the help of John's brother Grayson, Isobel and John flee town days later, leaving Grayson and his wife Miranda to adopt Elena as their own. A doctor, Grayson fakes a birth certificate so that it appeared Elena was his daughter with Miranda. The next year, Miranda and Grayson had a child of their own, Jeremy Gilbert. Elena dates her childhood friend Matt Donovan, who was her first love. On 23 May 2009, Elena is picked up by her mother and father after getting in a fight with Matt while attending the party. The three of them later end up in a car accident, with their car driving off a bridge. Stefan Salvatore finds them, and saves Elena, but it was too late to save Grayson and Miranda, who died. It remained unknown for months who saved Elena, and it was considered a miracle that she lived. Her relationship with Matt ended when they broke up.\n\n===Storyline===\n\n====Season 1====\nElena, still empty after losing her parents, begins to fit back into school. She meets a mysterious new student named Stefan Salvatore. They connect instantly, and begin dating. She meets his older and malevolent brother, Damon. After researching, Elena realizes Stefan was alive in 1953. It is later revealed that he is a 162-year-old vampire. Damon also begins falling for Elena. Elena finds a picture of a woman named Katherine Pierce who looks exactly like her. Stefan reveals that it is the woman who made him and Damon feud 145 years ago, and the person who turned them into vampires. He also told her that he is the person that saved her the night of her parents death. At the end of season one, Elena discovers that Grayson and Miranda weren't her biological parents, and that a woman named Isobel and her uncle John, who she grew up hating, were.\n\n====Season 2====\nIn season two, she learns that she is a Petrova doppelg\u00e4nger, having an appearance just like Katherine Pierce, which means that she has to be sacrificed to release Klaus' werewolf side. The sacrifice later happens, but Elena is saved, because John sacrificed himself for her after being put under a spell by Bonnie. However, her aunt Jenna is turned into a vampire and, as part of the sacrifice, is killed by Klaus, leaving Elena without a guardian. In the season two finale, while Damon is dying due to a werewolf bite, she forgives him for forcing her to drink his blood and kisses him with the thought that it might be Damon's last day, however Damon gets cured by drinking Klaus' blood.\n\n====Season 3====\nIn season three, Elena does everything in her power to make Stefan get his humanity back, which was turned off by Klaus as payment for saving Damon from a werewolf bite in the latter part of season two. Meanwhile, she grows closer to Damon while working together on saving Stefan and trying to defeat Klaus, eventually even sharing a kiss. She later admits to Stefan that she has feelings for Damon as well but that she never stopped loving Stefan. While in Denver together, Elena kisses Damon, later telling him that she doesn't know how she feels about him. It is eventually revealed that Elena met Damon the night of her parent's death, though he compelled her to forget. She eventually chooses Stefan in the season finale but before she can tell him, Elena drowns while having vampire blood in her system. During the last moments of season three, she awakens as a vampire in transition.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed. Elena had chosen Damon as the Salvatore that she loved.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn season five, Elena starts at Whitmore College and is happy after spending the summer with Damon. There she realises that Silas has taken Stefan's place and that Stefan is in that safe in a river constantly drowning. She and Damon then find the safe, only to find a dead body there meaning that someone opened the safe and Stefan is a Ripper again. However, Qetsiyah had fried Stefan's brain causing him to suffer amnesia. While trying to bring him back, they almost kiss meaning that she still feels something for him. Qetsiyah soon brings back Stefan's memories and says that Elena and Stefan were always meant to be as the Universe had to unite the doppelg\u00e4ngers of Silas and Amara. This leaves Damon and Elena questioning their relationship. Later on she is kidnapped and experimented on by Wes Maxfield, and she learns that her father also used to experiment on vampires.\nLater, when Katherine is about to die as a result of all of her years catching up with her as a result of having the cure in her system, Katherine uses a spell and possesses Elena, a fact that her friends were initially unable to deduce. But once they did, they trapped Katherine and left her with no escape. Stefan stabbed her with the traveller dagger, but ghost Katherine reveals to Bonnie, shortly before trying to cross into the Other Side, that she had injected Dr. Maxfield's enhanced ripper/werewolf virus into Elena's body, infecting Elena. The gang is eventually able to find an antidote.\nShe unfortunately loses trust in Damon, partly because he killed her friend Aaron, so they break up, but realise they cannot survive being apart and get back together.\nOnce Markos and his traveller army begin to take over Mystic Falls, setting an anti-magic barrier around the town, the gang comes up with a plan to take out the travellers by killing them all at the same time, overpowering the anchor to the Other Side AKA Bonnie and creating a possible way out of the now-collapsing Other Side. Elena and Damon drive into the gas-filled Mystic Grill with most of the travellers in it, blowing it up and killing most of the people in it, including Elena and Damon. She wakes up as a ghost and finds her body, sending her to Bonnie, where she passes to the Other Side, and she and many others are able to pass back to the land of the living afterwards. But the spell that allows this is broken before Damon passes back through, and as Bonnie is the anchor, she is a part of the Other Side and shall therefore disappear along with it. This leaves the gang mourning the loss of Damon and Bonnie in the season finale.\n\n====Season 6====\nIn season six, Elena starts back at Whitmore, and is unable to set foot in her hometown. She is also unable to recover from Damon's death and starts lurking the borders of Mystic Falls in order to grab civilians, drink their blood, then compel them to forget, but as spirit magic no longer works in Mystic Falls, any of her victims who cross into the town remember the ordeal, putting her identity as a vampire at risk when one of her victims, Sarah, comes to town.\nElena begs Alaric to compel her to forget that she ever loved Damon, which Alaric is able to do, due to him being an Enhanced Original, with the ability to compel other vampires. She eventually wears him down and asks her friends to never remind her once the compulsion had been done. After a number of failed attempts, Alaric successfully compels her to forget her love for Damon. She however leaves Alaric with some of her reminders of Damon, should she ever need them again. She is told of her former feelings for Damon soon afterwards, but decides to stay the way she is, as she doesn't want to go back to being unhappy again. She starts to date her classmate, Liam. \nOnce Damon comes back to life, Alaric tries to convince Elena to allow him to undo the compulsion, a decision she is reluctant to make. She eventually decides to have him undo it, but Alaric goes back to being human again after crossing into Mystic Falls, causing him to lose his vampire status (he only stayed alive because his once fatal human injuries were healed), meaning he will not be able to do so. She is then left to finally come face-to-face with Damon and see if she'll still feel the same way about him. They eventually rekindle their relationship, Elena takes the cure that Bonnie gave Damon. At Alaric's wedding, Kai ruins their wedding and casts a sleeping spell on Elena, linking her life to Bonnie's. She makes a sacrifice to let Bonnie live out her life until it is her turn. She bids goodbye to her friends and loved ones before parting ways but knows that she will see Damon, Stefan and Caroline again one day.\n\n====Season 7====\nElena doesn't make an appearance but is heard calling Damon's name when he visits the Armory vault. It was a way of Sybil, the Siren, luring him into a trap.\n\n====Season 8====\nIn the final episode, Elena makes an appearance. When a weakened Bonnie dies from the sounding bell, she meets Elena in a dream-like forest. Elena hugs her and wonders if she really has died. Enzo appears and says it isn't her time and takes Bonnie back to the world of the living. When Bonnie wakes up, it was Stefan who resuscitated her. Elena, asleep, is then taken to the Mystic Falls High School by Katherine and places her in the boiler room. Stefan tries to rescue Elena, but Katherine had Kai spell the boiler room, so that Elena can't be taken out of the room. After Bonnie had deflected the hellfire back into the bell, Bonnie passes out. Elena wakes up and wanders the school. Stefan meets up with her. It looks like Bonnie has died, but in fact Elena is still sleeping and Stefan's ghost came to visit her in her dream. He had taken the place of killing Katherine instead of Damon, since Damon is human after Stefan gave him the cure. He came to say goodbye. After a tearful hug and saying goodbye, Stefan goes into afterlife. Elena finally wakes up because Bonnie has broken the spell over her. Elena reunites with Damon and the rest of the gang. Elena gives Caroline the message Stefan whispered into her ear, saying he did hear her voice message and will love her forever. In the epilogue, Elena continued to study at medical school. After finishing her education, she went back to Mystic Falls and lived together with Damon, happily married for a long time. After living out her life, she crosses over to the afterlife where she finally reunites with her parents, Aunt Jenna and Uncle John.\n\n==== Post-Season 8 ====\nThe second-last episode of ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', '[[The Originals (season 5)|The Tale of Two Wolves]]', features [[List of The Originals characters|Elijah and Hope Mikaelson]] visiting Mystic Falls, and the window of a doctor's office reads 'Elena Salvatore, M.D.', showing that Elena got her own medical practice.\n\n==Reception==\nElena has received mainly positive reviews. Steve West of the Cinema Blend compared the story of ''The Vampire Diaries'' and the character of Elena to the popular vampire franchise, ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', and its protagonist [[Bella Swan]]. West said \"Clearly Elena is way hotter than Bella, she has two immortal vampires fighting over her\".<ref name=\"casted\" /> After she transitioned into a vampire, Carina Adly MacKenzie of [[Zap2it]] hoped that the \"fierce\" and \"ripper\" side of Elena would emerge when \"someone messes with the people she loves\".<ref name=\"AT\" /> McKenzie noted that when a person becomes a vampire, \"their strongest personality traits are heightened\", and hoped that wouldn't see Elena's \"compassion and selflessness\" double into \"helping old ladies with their groceries and nursing injured animals back to health\".<ref name=\"AT\">{{cite web|last=MacKenzie|first=Carina Adly|title='The Vampire Diaries' Season 4: Elena vs Katherine and 10 other things we want to see|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|work=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=24 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102111025/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/05/the-vampire-diaries-season-4-elena-vs-katherine-and-10-other-things-we-want-to-see.html|archive-date=2 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Robyn Ross of ''[[TV Guide]]'' also hoped that after Elena \"has had a taste for blood\", she would lose control.

In the same way the [[Bravais lattice]] is divided up into [[Wigner\u2013Seitz cell]]s in the real lattice, the [[reciprocal lattice]] is broken up into Brillouin zones. The boundaries of this cell are given by planes related to points on the [[reciprocal lattice]]. The importance of the Brillouin zone stems from the [[Bloch wave]] description of waves in a periodic medium, in which it is found that the solutions can be completely characterized by their behavior in a single Brillouin zone.\n\nThe first Brillouin zone is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points in reciprocal space that are closer to the origin of the reciprocal lattice than they are to any other reciprocal lattice points (see the derivation of the [[Wigner-Seitz cell]]). Another definition is as the set of points in ''k''-space that can be reached from the origin without crossing any [[Bragg plane]].  Equivalently, this is the [[Voronoi cell]] around the origin of the reciprocal lattice.\n\n[[File:Phonon k 3k.gif|thumb|k-vectors exceeding the first Brillouin zone (red) do not carry any more information than their counterparts (black) in the first Brillouin zone.  k at the Brilliouin zone edge is the spatial [[Nyquist frequency]] of waves in the lattice, because it corresponds to a half-wavelength equal to the inter-atomic lattice spacing ''a''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://solidstate.mines.edu/videonotes/VN_5_2.pdf|title=Topic 5-2: Nyquist Frequency and Group Velocity|last=|first=|last2=|date=|website=Solid State Physics in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Colorado School of Mines]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> See also {{Section link|Aliasing|Sampling sinusoidal functions}} for more on the equivalence of k-vectors.]]\n\nThere are also second, third, ''etc.'', Brillouin zones, corresponding to a sequence of disjoint regions (all with the same volume) at increasing distances from the origin, but these are used less frequently.  As a result, the ''first'' Brillouin zone is often called simply the ''Brillouin zone''.  In general, the ''n''-th Brillouin zone consists of the set of points that can be reached from the origin by crossing exactly ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 distinct Bragg planes. A related concept is that of the '''irreducible Brillouin zone''', which is the first Brillouin zone reduced by all of the symmetries in the [[point group]] of the lattice (point group of the crystal).\n\nThe concept of a Brillouin zone was developed by [[L\u00e9on Brillouin]] (1889\u20131969), a French physicist.\n\n==Critical points==\n\n[[File:Brillouin Zone (1st, FCC).svg|thumb|360px|First Brillouin zone of [[Cubic crystal system|FCC lattice]], a [[truncated octahedron]], showing symmetry labels for high symmetry lines and points]]\n\t \nSeveral points of high symmetry are of special interest \u2013 these are called critical points.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harald |last=Ibach |first2=Hans |last2=L\u00fcth |title=Solid-State Physics, An Introduction to Principles of Materials Science |edition=2nd |year=1996 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-3-540-58573-2}}</ref>\n \t\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Symbol!!Description\t\n|-\n|\u0393||Center of the Brillouin zone\t\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Simple cube\t\n|-\n|M||Center of an edge\n|-\n|R||Corner point\t\n|-\n|X||Center of a face\t\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Face-centered cubic \t\n|-\n|K||Middle of an edge joining two hexagonal faces\n|-\n|L||Center of a hexagonal face\t\n|-\n|U||Middle of an edge joining a hexagonal and a square face\n|- \n|W||Corner point\t\n|-\n|X||Center of a square face\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Body-centered cubic\t\n|-\n|H||Corner point joining four edges\t\n|-\n|N||Center of a face\t\n|-\n|P||Corner point joining three edges\t\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Hexagonal\t\n|-\n|A||Center of a hexagonal face\t\n|-\n|H||Corner point \t\n|-\n|K||Middle of an edge joining two rectangular faces \n|- \n|L||Middle of an edge joining a hexagonal and a rectangular face \n|-\n|M||Center of a rectangular face\n|}\nOther lattices have different types of high-symmetry points.

He had been a prominent member of the [[Populares|populist faction]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna]] and [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. During the latter years of the [[Sulla's Second Civil War|civil war]] he was sent to recover the Iberian Peninsula. When his faction lost the war he was [[Proscription|proscribed]] (outlawed) by the dictator [[Sulla]]. Supported by a majority of the native Spanish tribes, Sertorius skillfuly used [[irregular warfare]] to repeatedly defeat various commanders sent by Rome to subdue him. He was never decisively beaten on the battlefield and remained a thorn in the Senate's side until his murder in 72 BC.\n\nThe Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] dedicated one of his [[Parallel Lives]] to Sertorius; in it he pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]]. Like Eumenes, Sertorius was betrayed by his own men.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Parallel Lives, Life of Sertorius''; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', {{ISBN|1-84884-787-4}}</ref><ref name=\"britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/535908/Quintus-Sertorius \"Quintus Sertorius\"]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nSertorius was born in [[Nursia]] (a town which citizens had received Roman citizenship in 268 BC) in [[Sabine]] territory. We do not know exactly when Sertorius was born, but best estimates are in the range of 127-118 BC.<ref>Generally 123 BC is used as his year of birth.</ref> The Sertorius family were minor aristocrats, almost certainly [[Equites Romani]], the class directly below the senatorial class. His father died before he became of age and his mother, Rhae, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Like many other young ''domi nobiles'' Sertorius moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 2-3.</ref> \n\nHe made enough of an impression on the young Cicero to merit a special mention in a later treatise on oratory:\n\n::Of all the totally illiterate and crude orators, well, actually ranters, I ever knew \u2013 and I might as well add 'completely coarse and rustic' \u2013 the roughest and readiest were Q. Sertorius ...<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 180.</ref>\n\nAfter his undistinguished career in [[Rome]] as a [[jurist]] and an [[orator]], he entered the military. His first recorded campaign was under [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and ended at the [[Battle of Arausio]] in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. Serving under [[Gaius Marius]], Sertorius succeeded in spying on the wandering Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.57; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 6-7; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 3.</ref> After this success, he almost certainly fought at the great [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] (now [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]]) in 102 BC in which the [[Teutones]] and the [[Ambrones]] were decisively defeated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.11.</ref> He probably also fought at the [[battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC where the [[Cimbri]] were decisively defeated ending the German invasion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.15.</ref> A few years after the [[Cimbrian War|Cimbric wars]] Sertorius's patron Gaius Marius fell out of grace for his support of the demagogue [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] and he and Sertorius had to get out of Rome for a while. Sertorius went to the [[Hispania Ulterior]] as a military [[tribune]] under [[Titus Didius]]. There he was rewarded with the [[Grass Crown]] for crushing an insurrection in and around [[Castulo]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Marius'', 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.17.</ref>\n\n==Social War and Civil War==\n{{main|Social War (91-88 BC)|Sulla's first civil war|Sulla's second civil war}}\nIn 91 BC, he was elected [[quaestor]] and served in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], where he was in charge of recruiting and training legionaries for the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. During the war he sustained a wound that cost him the use of one of his eyes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p. 22; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref> \n::Sertorius used his wounds as personal propaganda. Being scarred in the face had its advantages. 'Other men, he used to say, could not always carry about them the evidence of their heroic achievements. Their tokens, wreaths and spears of honour must at some times be set aside. His proof of valour remained with him at all times.'<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref>\nUpon his return to Rome he ran for [[tribune of the Plebs]], but [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] thwarted his efforts (for reasons unknown, but probably because he was in Marius's [[Client (Roman)|clientele]] and Sulla and Marius were at odds), causing Sertorius to oppose Sulla.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 164.</ref> Sertorius, however, did manage to become a senator on the strength of his earlier quaestorship.\n\nIn 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla [[Sulla's first civil war|marched his legions on Rome]] and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, Sulla then left Italy to fight the [[First Mithridatic War]] against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. After Sulla left, violence erupted between the [[optimates]], led by the consul [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], and the [[populares]], led by the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]]. Sertorius, being a former subordinate of Marius, declared for Cinna and the populares.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.26</ref> When Cinna was driven from Rome he and Sertorius started recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable them, in their turn, to march on Rome. Though he had a very bad opinion of Marius by then, he consented to Marius's return upon understanding that Marius came at Cinna's request and not of his own accord.\n\n::Oh, really? Here I was thinking that Marius had decided for himself to come to Italy, and so I was trying to decide what good it would do. But it turns out there's nothing to discuss. Since after all, you invited him, then you have to receive and employ him. There's no question about it.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 5.</ref>\n\nIn October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna's divisions and fought a battle with troops commanded by [[Pompeius Strabo]].<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.20; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.111; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.27.</ref> After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the [[proscriptions]] his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius, and move Cinna to moderation.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> After Marius' death he annihilated Marius' slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 28-29; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe years 87-84 BC are often described as spent 'waiting for Sulla'.<ref>E. Badian, ''Waiting for Sulla, Journal of Roman Studies, vol 52 (1962)'', pp 47-61.</ref> Marius died in January 86 BC. Cinna was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in the year Cinna died.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 29-31.</ref> \n\nOn Sulla's return from the East in 83 BC a [[Sulla's second civil war|second civil war]] broke out. Sertorius, a praetor now, was called upon to serve in the government's armies. When the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Scipio Asiaticus]] marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] and found the other consul, [[Gaius Norbanus]], blocking the road to [[Capua]]. At the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]] Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>  The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio's advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations. Sertorius did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to Sulla. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust he was given back his hostages as a sign of good faith. This behavior of their commander caused Scipio's troops to lose faith in him. Unwilling to fight Sulla's battle hardened veterans they defected. Scipio and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134.</ref>  In 82 BC, Marius' son, [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], became consul without having held the offices which a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 32.</ref> Plutarch sums up the events:\n\n:: Cinna was murdered and against the wishes of Sertorius, and against the law, the younger Marius took the consulship while [ineffectual] men as Carbo, Norbanus and Scipio had no success in stopping Sulla's advance on Rome, so the Marian cause was being ruined and lost; cowardice and weakness by the generals played its part, and treachery did the rest, and there was no reason why Sertorius should stay to watch things going from bad to worse through the inferior judgement of men with superior power.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref>\n\n==Propraetor of Hispania and Fugitive==\n[[File:Hispania 1a division provincial.PNG|right|290px|thumb|Iberia, showing the Roman Provinces in the time of Sertorius.]]\nAfter having fallen out with the new populares leadership Sertorius was sent to [[Hispania]] as [[propraetor]], representing the Cinna-Marian faction and their cause in Spain.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> When Sertorius marched through the [[Pyrenee Mountains|Pyrenees mountain range]] he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe which demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions indignantly claimed it was an outrage; but while they considered it disgraceful to give in to extortion, Sertorius simply paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 52; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> The governor of the two Spanish provinces, [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul)|Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. Then he persuaded the local chieftans of accepting him as the new governor and endeared himself with the general population by cutting taxes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 53; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sought to hold them by sending an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees; however, Sulla's forces, under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, broke through after Salinator was assassinated by Calpurnius Lanarius, who defected to the Sullans.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 57; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\nUnable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he decided to abandon his provinces. With 3,000 of his most loyal followers he fled to [[Mauritania]], but was driven off by the locals who wanted no part of his rebellion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 57-58.</ref> He then fell in with a band of [[Cilician pirates]] who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took [[Pityusic Islands|Pityussa]], the most southerly of the [[Balearic Islands]], which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius Luscus, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 59.</ref> The pirates defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis<ref>A local client of Sulla</ref> on the throne of [[Tangier|Tingis]]. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the locals around Tingis, who were unhappy with Ascalis for they saw him as a puppet of Sulla, and defeated Ascalis's men and the pirates in battle.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining control over Tingis Sertorius defeated Paccianus, one of Sulla's generals, who had been sent to put Ascalis on the throne.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nLocal legend had it that [[Antaeus]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia]], and the husband of Tinge who gave name to Tingis, was buried in Mauritania. Sertorius had the tomb excavated for he wanted to see the body of Antaeus which was reported to be sixty cubits<ref>Sixty cubits is about ninety feet.</ref> in size. According to Plutarch, Sertorius was dumbfounded by what he saw and after performing a sacrifice, he filled the tomb up again, and thereafter was among those promoting its traditions and honours.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nThe North African success won him the fame and admiration of the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|people of Hispania]], particularly that of the warlike [[Lusitanians]] in the west, whom Roman generals and proconsuls of Sulla's party had plundered and oppressed. The Lusitanians, being treatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. Sertorius decided to accept the Lusitanian offer and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Sertorian War==\n{{Main|Sertorian War}}\n[[File:Gerard van Kuijl - Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail 1638.jpg|thumb|Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail, by [[Gerard van der Kuijl]], 1638]]\nOn a moonless night in the year 80 BC, Sertorius sailed his forces from Tingis across the Gibraltar strait back to Hispania.<ref>He chose a moonless night in order to remain undetected, but was detected nevertheless.</ref> A small fleet from the coastal town of Mellaria tried to stop him, but he pushed them aside and landed his army at the small fishing town of Baelo near the [[Pillars of Hercules]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 63-64.</ref> After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Fufidius, the local Roman governor, intend on defeating him to strengthen his support and prestige. At the [[Battle of the Baetis River]], fought at the Baetis estuary, he defeated Fufidius and started to consolidate his power in Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 64-65.</ref>\n\nBrave, noble, and gifted with eloquence, Sertorius was just the man to impress the native warriors, whom he organized into an army. They spoke of him as the \"new [[Hannibal]]\" whom he resembled physically (having one eye) and in military skill; he was an extraordinary general who repeatedly defeated forces many times his own force's size. Many Roman and Italian refugees and deserters joined him, and with these and his Spanish and African volunteers and mercenaries he completely defeated several of Sulla's generals (Fufidius, [[Marcus Domitius Calvinus (praetor 80 BC)|Domitius Calvinus]] and to some less-direct extent Thorius and Manlius). In 77 BC he drove [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] the proconsul of Hispania Ulterior, who had been given a proconsular command specifically to defeat him, out of his own province.\n\nIn 76 BC, after Sertorius had been reinforced by the rebel army of [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Marcus Perperna]], the Roman Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command (pro consulibus) to [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]] to help out Metellus who was doing miserably against Sertorius.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 17.</ref> Pompey recruited a large army from among his father's and Sulla's veterans and marched to Spain.

Sertorius then ruined his army at the [[Battle of Sucro]]<ref>[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.110; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 19; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 18.</ref> and the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]]<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 21.</ref>, forcing him on the defensive. From then on Sertorius refrained from fighting battles and reverted to guerrilla warfare. Although Pompey and Metellus had gained the initiative the war was far from over. Sertorius still enjoyed the support of the inland tribes and their warriors still flocked to his cause.\n\nSertorius owed some of his success to his prodigious ability as a statesman. His goal was to build a stable government in Hispania with the consent and co-operation of the people, whom he wished to [[civilize]] along the lines of the Roman model. He established a senate of 300 members, drawn from Roman emigrants (probably also including some from the highest aristocrats of Hispania) and kept a Hispanian bodyguard. For the children of the chief native families he provided a school at Osca ([[Huesca]]), where they received a Roman education and even adopted the dress and education of Roman youths. This followed the Roman practice of taking [[hostage]]s. Late in his campaigns, a revolt of the native people arose and Sertorius killed several of the children that he had sent to school at Osca, selling many others into slavery.<ref name=plutarch>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/lives/chapter41.html Sertorius], by [[Plutarch]]</ref>\n[[File:Setorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|400px|left|''Sertorius and the Example of the Horses'', after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.<ref>Christian M\u00fcller in ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515\u20131532,'' Christian M\u00fcller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; ''et al'', Munich: Prestel, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3580-3}}, {{nowrap|pp. 263\u201364}}.</ref>]]\nAlthough he was strict and severe with his soldiers, he was particularly considerate to the people in general, and made their burdens as light as possible. It seems clear that he had a peculiar gift for evoking the enthusiasm of the native tribes, and we can understand well how he was able to use a famous white fawn, a present from one of the natives that was supposed to communicate to him the advice of the goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], to his advantage.\n\n[[File:White Fawn Drawing.jpg|right|thumb|Sertorius claimed to receive messages from [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] via a white fawn.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>]]\n::Spanus, one of the commononers who lived in the country came across a doe trying to escape from hunters. The doe fled faster than he could pursue, but the animal had newly given birth. He [Spanus] was struck by the unusual colour of the fawn, for it was pure white. He pursued and caught it.\nAs it happened, Sertorius was in the area, and it was known that he amply rewarded those who brought him game and produce. So Spanus gave the fawn to Sertorius, who at that time felt only the usual pleasure of one who receives such gift. \nAfter a while the animal became so tame and well-trained that it came when he called it, and followed him on his walks without minding the crowds and bustle of life in camp. [That the fawn did this tells us something more about the character of Sertorius.] Eventually it occurred to him that the barbarians easily fall into superstition, so he started to give the fawn religious significance.\nHe announced that the doe had been sent by [the goddess] Diana, and solemnly claimed that through the doe she revealed hidden information to him. He helped the idea along by various tricks. If he heard of an enemy raid into his territory, or an attempt to subvert a city from its allegiance to him, he would claim that the fawn had told him of this in a dream, and tell his men to prepare.\nOr when his commanders sent him messages of victory, he would hide the messenger and bring out the white fawn wearing celebratory garlands. He would sacrifice to the gods, and tell his men to celebrate because they would soon hear something good had happened.\nBy such stratagems he persuaded his people they were not by the fallible wisdom of some foreigner, but by divine power. So the people were made tractable and all the more ready to help him with his plans, and consequently the extraordinary growth of Sertorius's power led to reinforcing this belief.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 11</ref>\n\nFor six years he held sway over Hispania. In 76 BC, he was joined \u2014 at the insistence of the forces he brought with him \u2014 by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento]] from Rome, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]].<ref name=plutarch/> In the same year, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (now better known as Pompey) was sent to help Metellus take back Hispania and crush Sertorius's rebelion. Contemptuously calling Pompey 'the young pup' and Metellus 'the old woman' Sertorius proved himself more than a match for his adversaries. After the [[Battle of Lauron]], in which he out-generaled Pompey and massacred part of his army, he razed the city (proving Pompey and Metellus could not protect their allies). In 75 BC, Pompey and Metellus made a comeback, Pompey defeated Sertorius' legates Herrenius and Perpenna in the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|battle of Valentia]] and Metellus was able to crush another Sertorian army when he defeated Hirtuleius at the [[Battle of Italica]]. Sertorius responded by marching against Pompey and nearly capturing him at the [[Battle of Sucro]], when Pompey decided to fight him without waiting for Metellus. After these battles Sertorius was indecisively beaten at the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]] and had to revert to guerrilla combat again. Pompey wrote to Rome for reinforcements, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. With these reinforcements Pompey and Metellus were gaining the upper hand, grinding down their enemy by war of attrition, capturing stronghold after stronghold. Though Sertorius was still able to win some victories, he was losing the war, and his authority over his men was declining. He lost much of his acumen and authority, descending into alcoholism and debauchery<ref>Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.152.</ref>\n\nSertorius was in league with the [[Cilician Pirates]], who had bases and fleets all around the [[Mediterranean]], was negotiating with the formidable [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], and was in communication with the insurgent slaves of [[Spartacus]] in [[Italy]]. But due to jealousies among his high ranking Roman officers and some Iberian chieftains as well a conspiracy was beginning to take form.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 25.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 74 and 73 BC, Pompey and Metellus had been slowly grinding down Sertorius's rebellion. Unable to defeat him in battle they had opted for attritional warfare, what had worked against Hannibal a century and a half before would now be brought to bear on Sertorius. Metellus seeing that the key to victory was removing Sertorius had made his pitch toward the Romans still with Sertorius. 'Should any Roman kill Sertorius he would be given a hundred talents of silver and twenty-thousand acres of land. If he was an exile he would be free to return to Rome'.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 22.</ref> This turned Sertorius paranoid, he started distrusting his Roman retinue. He also no longer trusted his Roman bodyguard, exchanging it for a Spanish one.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe war was not going well, so the Roman aristocrats and senators who made up the higher classes of his domain became discontented with Sertorius. They had grown jealous of Sertorius's power, and Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius's place, encouraged that jealousy for his own ends. The conspirators took to damaging Sertorius by oppressing the local [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] tribes in his name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, which resulted in a cycle of oppression and revolt, with Sertorius none the wiser as to who was creating such mischief.\n\nPerperna and his fellow conspirator invited Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general and get him off his couch and among the crowd where a knife could be shoved through his ribs without difficulty. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. This presented something of a problem as Sertorius, although in late middle age, had a well deserved reputation as a skilled fighter. They changed their tactic, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they rushed and stabbed the unsuspecting Sertorius until he was dead.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 153-154.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nUpon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. To make matters worse for Perperna when Sertorius's will was read he had named him his chief beneficiary. Perperna already disgraced as the man who had slain his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. And now that he was dead, the virtues of Sertorius were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 156-157.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text= People are generally less angry with those who have died, and when they no longer see him alive before them they tend to dwell tenderly on his virtues. So it was with Sertorius. Anger against him suddenly turned to affection and the soldiers clamorously rose up in protest against Perperna.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'', 1.114.</ref>}}\n\nSertorius's independent \"Roman\" Republic in Spain crumbled with the renewed onslaught of Pompey and Metellus, who crushed Perperna's army and eliminated the remaining opposition.\n\n==In Modern Fiction==\n*In [[Colleen McCullough]]'s novels [[The First Man in Rome (novel)|The First Man in Rome]] and [[Fortune's Favourites]], Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n*In [[Steven Saylor]]'s short story ''The White Fawn'', Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sertoria (gens)]]\n* [[Sertorian War]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', ''Life of Sertorius'' (in his ''Parallel Lives'' Plutarch pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]] \u2212 Plutarch saw many parallels between the lives of these two men)\n* Plutarch, ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', ''Life of Pompey'', 18.\n* [[Appian]], ''Bell. civ.''

He had been a prominent member of the [[Populares|populist faction]] of [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna]] and [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]. During the latter years of the [[Sulla's Second Civil War|civil war]] he was sent to recover the Iberian Peninsula. When his faction lost the war he was [[Proscription|proscribed]] (outlawed) by the dictator [[Sulla]]. Supported by a majority of the native Spanish tribes, Sertorius skillfuly used [[irregular warfare]] to repeatedly defeat various commanders sent by Rome to subdue him. He was never decisively beaten on the battlefield and remained a thorn in the Senate's side until his murder in 72 BC.\n\nThe Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] dedicated one of his [[Parallel Lives]] to Sertorius; in it he pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]]. Like Eumenes, Sertorius was betrayed by his own men.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Parallel Lives, Life of Sertorius''; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', {{ISBN|1-84884-787-4}}</ref><ref name=\"britannica\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/535908/Quintus-Sertorius \"Quintus Sertorius\"]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nSertorius was born in [[Nursia]] (a town which citizens had received Roman citizenship in 268 BC) in [[Sabine]] territory. We do not know exactly when Sertorius was born, but best estimates are in the range of 127-118 BC.<ref>Generally 123 BC is used as his year of birth.</ref> The Sertorius family were minor aristocrats, almost certainly [[Equites Romani]], the class directly below the senatorial class. His father died before he became of age and his mother, Rhae, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Like many other young ''domi nobiles'' Sertorius moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 2-3.</ref> \n\nHe made enough of an impression on the young Cicero to merit a special mention in a later treatise on oratory:\n\n::Of all the totally illiterate and crude orators, well, actually ranters, I ever knew \u2013 and I might as well add 'completely coarse and rustic' \u2013 the roughest and readiest were Q. Sertorius ...<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 180.</ref>\n\nAfter his undistinguished career in [[Rome]] as a [[jurist]] and an [[orator]], he entered the military. His first recorded campaign was under [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]] and ended at the [[Battle of Arausio]] in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. Serving under [[Gaius Marius]], Sertorius succeeded in spying on the wandering Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.57; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 6-7; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 3.</ref> After this success, he almost certainly fought at the great [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]] (now [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[France]]) in 102 BC in which the [[Teutones]] and the [[Ambrones]] were decisively defeated.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.11.</ref> He probably also fought at the [[battle of Vercellae]] in 101 BC where the [[Cimbri]] were decisively defeated ending the German invasion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.15.</ref> A few years after the [[Cimbrian War|Cimbric wars]] Sertorius's patron Gaius Marius fell out of grace for his support of the demagogue [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] and he and Sertorius had to get out of Rome for a while. Sertorius went to the [[Hispania Ulterior]] as a military [[tribune]] under [[Titus Didius]]. There he was rewarded with the [[Grass Crown]] for crushing an insurrection in and around [[Castulo]].<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Marius'', 27; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p.17.</ref>\n\n==Social War and Civil War==\n{{main|Social War (91-88 BC)|Sulla's first civil war|Sulla's second civil war}}\nIn 91 BC, he was elected [[quaestor]] and served in [[Cisalpine Gaul]], where he was in charge of recruiting and training legionaries for the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. During the war he sustained a wound that cost him the use of one of his eyes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', p. 22; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref> \n::Sertorius used his wounds as personal propaganda. Being scarred in the face had its advantages. 'Other men, he used to say, could not always carry about them the evidence of their heroic achievements. Their tokens, wreaths and spears of honour must at some times be set aside. His proof of valour remained with him at all times.'<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 8.</ref>\nUpon his return to Rome he ran for [[tribune of the Plebs]], but [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] thwarted his efforts (for reasons unknown, but probably because he was in Marius's [[Client (Roman)|clientele]] and Sulla and Marius were at odds), causing Sertorius to oppose Sulla.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 164.</ref> Sertorius, however, did manage to become a senator on the strength of his earlier quaestorship.\n\nIn 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla [[Sulla's first civil war|marched his legions on Rome]] and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, Sulla then left Italy to fight the [[First Mithridatic War]] against [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. After Sulla left, violence erupted between the [[optimates]], led by the consul [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], and the [[populares]], led by the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]]. Sertorius, being a former subordinate of Marius, declared for Cinna and the populares.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.26</ref> When Cinna was driven from Rome he and Sertorius started recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable them, in their turn, to march on Rome. Though he had a very bad opinion of Marius by then, he consented to Marius's return upon understanding that Marius came at Cinna's request and not of his own accord.\n\n::Oh, really? Here I was thinking that Marius had decided for himself to come to Italy, and so I was trying to decide what good it would do. But it turns out there's nothing to discuss. Since after all, you invited him, then you have to receive and employ him. There's no question about it.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 5.</ref>\n\nIn October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna's divisions and fought a battle with troops commanded by [[Pompeius Strabo]].<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.20; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.111; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p.27.</ref> After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the [[proscriptions]] his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius, and move Cinna to moderation.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> After Marius' death he annihilated Marius' slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 28-29; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe years 87-84 BC are often described as spent 'waiting for Sulla'.<ref>E. Badian, ''Waiting for Sulla, Journal of Roman Studies, vol 52 (1962)'', pp 47-61.</ref> Marius died in January 86 BC. Cinna was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in the year Cinna died.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 29-31.</ref> \n\nOn Sulla's return from the East in 83 BC a [[Sulla's second civil war|second civil war]] broke out. Sertorius, a praetor now, was called upon to serve in the government's armies. When the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC)|Scipio Asiaticus]] marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in [[Campania]] and found the other consul, [[Gaius Norbanus]], blocking the road to [[Capua]]. At the [[Battle of Mount Tifata]] Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.162; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', p. 133.</ref>  The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to [[Capua]]. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio's advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations. Sertorius did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to Sulla. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust he was given back his hostages as a sign of good faith. This behavior of their commander caused Scipio's troops to lose faith in him. Unwilling to fight Sulla's battle hardened veterans they defected. Scipio and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', pp 162-165; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great''. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, ''Cataclysm 90 BC'', pp 133-134.</ref>  In 82 BC, Marius' son, [[Gaius Marius the Younger]], became consul without having held the offices which a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 32.</ref> Plutarch sums up the events:\n\n:: Cinna was murdered and against the wishes of Sertorius, and against the law, the younger Marius took the consulship while [ineffectual] men as Carbo, Norbanus and Scipio had no success in stopping Sulla's advance on Rome, so the Marian cause was being ruined and lost; cowardice and weakness by the generals played its part, and treachery did the rest, and there was no reason why Sertorius should stay to watch things going from bad to worse through the inferior judgement of men with superior power.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref>\n\n==Propraetor of Hispania and Fugitive==\n[[File:Hispania 1a division provincial.PNG|right|290px|thumb|Iberia, showing the Roman Provinces in the time of Sertorius.]]\nAfter having fallen out with the new populares leadership Sertorius was sent to [[Hispania]] as [[propraetor]], representing the Cinna-Marian faction and their cause in Spain.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 32-33; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> When Sertorius marched through the [[Pyrenee Mountains|Pyrenees mountain range]] he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe which demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions indignantly claimed it was an outrage; but while they considered it disgraceful to give in to extortion, Sertorius simply paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 52; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> The governor of the two Spanish provinces, [[Hispania Ulterior]] and [[Hispania Citerior]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus (consul)|Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. Then he persuaded the local chieftans of accepting him as the new governor and endeared himself with the general population by cutting taxes.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 53; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 6.</ref> After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sought to hold them by sending an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees; however, Sulla's forces, under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, broke through after Salinator was assassinated by Calpurnius Lanarius, who defected to the Sullans.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 57; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 7.</ref>\n\nUnable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he decided to abandon his provinces. With 3,000 of his most loyal followers he fled to [[Mauritania]], but was driven off by the locals who wanted no part of his rebellion.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 57-58.</ref> He then fell in with a band of [[Cilician pirates]] who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took [[Pityusic Islands|Pityussa]], the most southerly of the [[Balearic Islands]], which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius Luscus, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 59.</ref> The pirates defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant Ascalis<ref>A local client of Sulla</ref> on the throne of [[Tangier|Tingis]]. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the locals around Tingis, who were unhappy with Ascalis for they saw him as a puppet of Sulla, and defeated Ascalis's men and the pirates in battle.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining control over Tingis Sertorius defeated Paccianus, one of Sulla's generals, who had been sent to put Ascalis on the throne.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 60-61; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nLocal legend had it that [[Antaeus]], the son of [[Poseidon]] and [[Gaia]], and the husband of Tinge who gave name to Tingis, was buried in Mauritania. Sertorius had the tomb excavated for he wanted to see the body of Antaeus which was reported to be sixty cubits<ref>Sixty cubits is about ninety feet.</ref> in size. According to Plutarch, Sertorius was dumbfounded by what he saw and after performing a sacrifice, he filled the tomb up again, and thereafter was among those promoting its traditions and honours.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 9.</ref>\n\nThe North African success won him the fame and admiration of the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|people of Hispania]], particularly that of the warlike [[Lusitanians]] in the west, whom Roman generals and proconsuls of Sulla's party had plundered and oppressed. The Lusitanians, being treatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. Sertorius decided to accept the Lusitanian offer and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Sertorian War==\n{{Main|Sertorian War}}\n[[File:Gerard van Kuijl - Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail 1638.jpg|thumb|Quintus Sertorius and the horse tail, by [[Gerard van der Kuijl]], 1638]]\nOn a moonless night in the year 80 BC, Sertorius sailed his forces from Tingis across the Gibraltar strait back to Hispania.<ref>He chose a moonless night in order to remain undetected, but was detected nevertheless.</ref> A small fleet from the coastal town of Mellaria tried to stop him, but he pushed them aside and landed his army at the small fishing town of Baelo near the [[Pillars of Hercules]].<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 63-64.</ref> After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Fufidius, the local Roman governor, intend on defeating him to strengthen his support and prestige. At the [[Battle of the Baetis River]], fought at the Baetis estuary, he defeated Fufidius and started to consolidate his power in Hispania.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 64-65.</ref>\n\nBrave, noble, and gifted with eloquence, Sertorius was just the man to impress the native warriors, whom he organized into an army. They spoke of him as the \"new [[Hannibal]]\" whom he resembled physically (having one eye) and in military skill; he was an extraordinary general who repeatedly defeated forces many times his own force's size. Many Roman and Italian refugees and deserters joined him, and with these and his Spanish and African volunteers and mercenaries he completely defeated several of Sulla's generals (Fufidius, [[Marcus Domitius Calvinus (praetor 80 BC)|Domitius Calvinus]] and to some less-direct extent Thorius and Manlius). In 77 BC he drove [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] the proconsul of Hispania Ulterior, who had been given a proconsular command specifically to defeat him, out of his own province.\n\nIn 76 BC, after Sertorius had been reinforced by the rebel army of [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Marcus Perperna]], the Roman Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command (pro consulibus) to [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus]] to help out Metellus who was doing miserably against Sertorius.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 17.</ref> Pompey recruited a large army from among his father's and Sulla's veterans and marched to Spain. Confident of success he engaged Sertorius at the [[Battle of Lauron]] in eastern Spain only to suffer a major defeat.<ref>Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.5.31; Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'', 18.3; Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 18; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 96-101.</ref>\n\nThe turning point came in 75 BC when Pompey and Metellus started scoring victories against Sertorius's subordinates. Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates [[Marcus Perperna Vento|Perperna]] and Herrenius at the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|Battle of Valentia]]<ref>Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118.</ref> and Metellus defeated [[Lucius Hirtuleius|Hirtuleius]] at the [[Battle of Italica]]<ref>Livy, ''Epitome'', 91.4; Frontinus, ''Stratagems'', 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p.47; Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp.118-119.</ref>. Sertorius then ruined his army at the [[Battle of Sucro]]<ref>[[Appian]], ''Civil Wars'', 1.110; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Sertorius'', 19; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Pompey'', 18.</ref> and the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]]<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 21.</ref>, forcing him on the defensive. From then on Sertorius refrained from fighting battles and reverted to guerrilla warfare. Although Pompey and Metellus had gained the initiative the war was far from over. Sertorius still enjoyed the support of the inland tribes and their warriors still flocked to his cause.\n\nSertorius owed some of his success to his prodigious ability as a statesman. His goal was to build a stable government in Hispania with the consent and co-operation of the people, whom he wished to [[civilize]] along the lines of the Roman model. He established a senate of 300 members, drawn from Roman emigrants (probably also including some from the highest aristocrats of Hispania) and kept a Hispanian bodyguard. For the children of the chief native families he provided a school at Osca ([[Huesca]]), where they received a Roman education and even adopted the dress and education of Roman youths. This followed the Roman practice of taking [[hostage]]s. Late in his campaigns, a revolt of the native people arose and Sertorius killed several of the children that he had sent to school at Osca, selling many others into slavery.<ref name=plutarch>[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/plutarch/lives/chapter41.html Sertorius], by [[Plutarch]]</ref>\n[[File:Setorius and the Example of the Horses, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|400px|left|''Sertorius and the Example of the Horses'', after [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. The drawing illustrates the example Sertorius gave to his followers that in the same way a horse's tail can be picked out hair by hair but not pulled out all at once, so smaller forces could defeat the Roman armies.<ref>Christian M\u00fcller in ''Hans Holbein the Younger: The Basel Years, 1515\u20131532,'' Christian M\u00fcller; Stephan Kemperdick; Maryan Ainsworth; ''et al'', Munich: Prestel, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3580-3}}, {{nowrap|pp. 263\u201364}}.</ref>]]\nAlthough he was strict and severe with his soldiers, he was particularly considerate to the people in general, and made their burdens as light as possible. It seems clear that he had a peculiar gift for evoking the enthusiasm of the native tribes, and we can understand well how he was able to use a famous white fawn, a present from one of the natives that was supposed to communicate to him the advice of the goddess [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], to his advantage.\n\n[[File:White Fawn Drawing.jpg|right|thumb|Sertorius claimed to receive messages from [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]] via a white fawn.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>]]\n::Spanus, one of the commononers who lived in the country came across a doe trying to escape from hunters. The doe fled faster than he could pursue, but the animal had newly given birth. He [Spanus] was struck by the unusual colour of the fawn, for it was pure white. He pursued and caught it.\nAs it happened, Sertorius was in the area, and it was known that he amply rewarded those who brought him game and produce. So Spanus gave the fawn to Sertorius, who at that time felt only the usual pleasure of one who receives such gift. \nAfter a while the animal became so tame and well-trained that it came when he called it, and followed him on his walks without minding the crowds and bustle of life in camp. [That the fawn did this tells us something more about the character of Sertorius.] Eventually it occurred to him that the barbarians easily fall into superstition, so he started to give the fawn religious significance.\nHe announced that the doe had been sent by [the goddess] Diana, and solemnly claimed that through the doe she revealed hidden information to him. He helped the idea along by various tricks. If he heard of an enemy raid into his territory, or an attempt to subvert a city from its allegiance to him, he would claim that the fawn had told him of this in a dream, and tell his men to prepare.\nOr when his commanders sent him messages of victory, he would hide the messenger and bring out the white fawn wearing celebratory garlands. He would sacrifice to the gods, and tell his men to celebrate because they would soon hear something good had happened.\nBy such stratagems he persuaded his people they were not by the fallible wisdom of some foreigner, but by divine power. So the people were made tractable and all the more ready to help him with his plans, and consequently the extraordinary growth of Sertorius's power led to reinforcing this belief.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 11</ref>\n\nFor six years he held sway over Hispania. In 76 BC, he was joined \u2014 at the insistence of the forces he brought with him \u2014 by [[Marcus Perpenna Vento]] from Rome, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]].<ref name=plutarch/> In the same year, [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (now better known as Pompey) was sent to help Metellus take back Hispania and crush Sertorius's rebelion. Contemptuously calling Pompey 'the young pup' and Metellus 'the old woman' Sertorius proved himself more than a match for his adversaries. After the [[Battle of Lauron]], in which he out-generaled Pompey and massacred part of his army, he razed the city (proving Pompey and Metellus could not protect their allies). In 75 BC, Pompey and Metellus made a comeback, Pompey defeated Sertorius' legates Herrenius and Perpenna in the [[Battle of Valentia 75 BC|battle of Valentia]] and Metellus was able to crush another Sertorian army when he defeated Hirtuleius at the [[Battle of Italica]]. Sertorius responded by marching against Pompey and nearly capturing him at the [[Battle of Sucro]], when Pompey decided to fight him without waiting for Metellus. After these battles Sertorius was indecisively beaten at the [[Battle of Saguntum (75 BC)|Battle of Saguntum]] and had to revert to guerrilla combat again. Pompey wrote to Rome for reinforcements, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. With these reinforcements Pompey and Metellus were gaining the upper hand, grinding down their enemy by war of attrition, capturing stronghold after stronghold. Though Sertorius was still able to win some victories, he was losing the war, and his authority over his men was declining. He lost much of his acumen and authority, descending into alcoholism and debauchery<ref>Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.152.</ref>\n\nSertorius was in league with the [[Cilician Pirates]], who had bases and fleets all around the [[Mediterranean]], was negotiating with the formidable [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]], and was in communication with the insurgent slaves of [[Spartacus]] in [[Italy]]. But due to jealousies among his high ranking Roman officers and some Iberian chieftains as well a conspiracy was beginning to take form.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 25.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn 74 and 73 BC, Pompey and Metellus had been slowly grinding down Sertorius's rebellion. Unable to defeat him in battle they had opted for attritional warfare, what had worked against Hannibal a century and a half before would now be brought to bear on Sertorius. Metellus seeing that the key to victory was removing Sertorius had made his pitch toward the Romans still with Sertorius. 'Should any Roman kill Sertorius he would be given a hundred talents of silver and twenty-thousand acres of land. If he was an exile he would be free to return to Rome'.<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Sertorius'', 22.</ref> This turned Sertorius paranoid, he started distrusting his Roman retinue. He also no longer trusted his Roman bodyguard, exchanging it for a Spanish one.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe war was not going well, so the Roman aristocrats and senators who made up the higher classes of his domain became discontented with Sertorius. They had grown jealous of Sertorius's power, and Perperna, aspiring to take Sertorius's place, encouraged that jealousy for his own ends. The conspirators took to damaging Sertorius by oppressing the local [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] tribes in his name. This stirred discontent and revolt in the tribes, which resulted in a cycle of oppression and revolt, with Sertorius none the wiser as to who was creating such mischief.\n\nPerperna and his fellow conspirator invited Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general and get him off his couch and among the crowd where a knife could be shoved through his ribs without difficulty. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. This presented something of a problem as Sertorius, although in late middle age, had a well deserved reputation as a skilled fighter. They changed their tactic, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they rushed and stabbed the unsuspecting Sertorius until he was dead.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the struggle for Spain'', pp 153-154.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nUpon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. To make matters worse for Perperna when Sertorius's will was read he had named him his chief beneficiary. Perperna already disgraced as the man who had slain his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. And now that he was dead, the virtues of Sertorius were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.<ref>Philip Matyszak, ''Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain'', pp 156-157.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text= People are generally less angry with those who have died, and when they no longer see him alive before them they tend to dwell tenderly on his virtues. So it was with Sertorius. Anger against him suddenly turned to affection and the soldiers clamorously rose up in protest against Perperna.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'', 1.114.</ref>}}\n\nSertorius's independent \"Roman\" Republic in Spain crumbled with the renewed onslaught of Pompey and Metellus, who crushed Perperna's army and eliminated the remaining opposition.\n\n==In Modern Fiction==\n*In [[Colleen McCullough]]'s novels [[The First Man in Rome (novel)|The First Man in Rome]] and [[Fortune's Favourites]], Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n*In [[Steven Saylor]]'s short story ''The White Fawn'', Quintus Sertorius features as one of the secondary characters.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sertoria (gens)]]\n* [[Sertorian War]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{colbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Plutarch]], [[Parallel Lives]], Life of Sertorius (in his ''Parallel Lives'' Plutarch pairs Sertorius with [[Eumenes]] \u2212 Plutarch saw many parallels between the lives of these two men)\n* Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.\n* [[Appian]], ''Bell. civ.''
