In order to clear his doubts he hires a network of spies to keep an eye on Raj and goes to an extent of brutally torturing Raj's friends so as to prove that the person who dons the appearance of Ram is Raj. While trying to convince the officer, he starts to receive mysterious calls from an anonymous employee of Ram who claims to know the real identity of Raj and threatens to expose it if he continues his drama as Ram.

His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137.

The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308.

This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes' did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

It was restored by the [[Concordat of 1801]], as the combination of the Dioceses of Quimper, [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] and [[Tr\u00e9guier]] in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Traditionally, it formed part of [[Lower Brittany]]. It now covers an area of 7,029&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,714 square miles) and contains a population of 852,685, of whom 750,000 (88%) are [[Catholic]].\n\nThe diocese is a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Rennes|Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo]]. The current bishop is Laurent Marie Bernard Dognin.\n\n==History==\n\n===Diocese of Quimper: early history===\nTwo versions of the catalogue of the Bishops of Quimper are known: one is from the twelfth century and is held by the Cartulary of Quimperl\u00e9; the other is preserved in a Quimper Cartulary of the fifteenth century.<ref>Duchesne, ''Fasti'' II, p. 372.</ref> Both mention a [[St Corentinus|St. Chorentius]] as first Bishop of Quimper. His hagiography, however, was developed relatively late in church history.  Nothing accurate is known about him, but he is supposed by some to have been ordained by [[Martin of Tours|St. Martin of Tours]] in the fourth century, while others claim that he was a sixth-century monk. Duchesne points out that, before the eleventh century, control of the list of Bishops of Quimper is \"tr\u00e8s difficile\".<ref>Duchesne, p. 374.</ref>  External material to provide verification is lacking. The tale of [[Winwaloe|Saint-Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 (Winwaloe)]] (ca. 460\u2013532), the alleged first Abbot of Landevennec, is, as Robert Latouche has shown, devoid of historical merit, and the documents on which it depends complete forgeries.<ref>Latouche, pp. 2-39.

An assembly of eight bishops of Provincia Lugdunensis Tertia took place at Angers on 4 October 453 to consecrate a new bishop for Angers. Four of the bishops can be associated with particular Sees. The other four are assigned by scholars to the other dioceses in the ecclesiastical province, one of which was Quimper. One of the four prelates, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius, was Bishop of Quimper.<ref>C. Munier, ''Concilia Galliae'' (Turnholt: Brepols 1963), p. 137.

The legend of [[St. Paul Aurelian]], written in 884, shows that the Breton monks believed the [[See of L\u00e9on]] had been founded in the [[Merovingian]] epoch. The hermit [[Ronan of Locronan|Saint Ronan]], a native of [[Ireland]], often held to be one of the 350 bishops consecrated by [[Saint Patrick]], was in the fifth century known as one of the apostles of Cornouailles and the neighbourhood around L\u00e9on. [[Paul Aurelian]], a Gallic monk, founder of monasteries at Ouessant on the north-west coast of [[Brittany]] and on the Island of [[\u00cele de Batz|Batz]], was believed to have founded in an abandoned fort a monastery which gave origin to the town of St. Pol de L\u00e9on, afterwards the seat of a diocese. He was the first titular of the see, a wonder-worker and prophet, and was held to have died in 575 at the age of 140 years, after having been assisted in his labours by three successive coadjutors. Though the monastery of L\u00e9on was probably founded by Paul Aurelian in the sixth century, the history of the diocese is more complicated. It is at least certain that there are traces in history of a [[Diocese of L\u00e9on]] as far back as the middle of the ninth century.<ref name=goyau/>\n\n====Cathedral of Saint-Corentin, Quimper====\nThe cornerstone of Quimper Cathedral was laid in 1424, but the building was still unfinished at the beginning of the sixteenth century. When [[Alexander VI]] granted that church the same indulgences as could be gained at the Roman Jubilee, funds came in which allowed its completion. The Chapter of the Cathedral was composed of six dignities and twelve Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Archdeacon of Cornuaille, the Archdeacon of Poher, the Treasurer, the Cantor and the Theologian.  The Abbot of Doulas was always first Canon ''ex officio'', and held precedence in the Chapter after the Bishop.<ref>Longdon, p. 308. Besse, VIII, pp. 267-268.</ref>\n\nThere were two Collegiate Churches in the diocese, Saint-Tr\u00e9meur de Carhaix and Notre-Dame de Rostrenen, each headed by a Cantor.<ref>Besse, VIII, p. 268.</ref>\n\nThe abbots of seven abbeys in the diocese were subject to nomination by the King and confirmation by the Pope: the Abbey of St. Maurice (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de Daoulac (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Landeunnes (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Saint-Crois de Quimperl\u00e9 (O.S.B.), the Abbey of Bonrepos (Premonstratensian), the Abbey of Notre Dame de Coeurmalao\u00fcen (O.S.B.), and the Abbey of Langonnet (O.S.B.).<ref>''Pouille of 1648'', pp. 8-9 (436-437).

This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The Chapter of Quimper entered a protest on 26 October 1790 against the uncanonical election of a bishop by 'electors'.  The [[Constituent Assembly]] chose, as successor of the deceased Bishop Conan de Saint-Luc, Louis Alexandre Expilly, the Rector of the church of St. Martin at Morlaix. He had been the delegate of Saint-Pol-de-Leon to the Estates General of 1789 and was one of the authors of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]].  Expilly was presented to [[King Louis XVI]] who ratified his election.  He therefore became the first of the Constitutional Bishops. The Chapter of Quimper on 17 November wrote to the Constitutional Bishop-elect proclaiming the nullity of his election.<ref>Morice et al., pp. 140-141</ref>\n\nExpilly was consecrated in Paris at the Oratory by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand]], Bishop of Autun, on 24 February 1791.

The lessons taught by the reduction in the number of bishoprics by the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790, and the rationalization of diocesan boundaries to coincide with civil administration districts called 'd\u00e9partmentes' did not go unnoticed.  Only four of the nine Breton dioceses were restored.  Quimper received all of the former diocese of St.-Pol-de-L\u00e9on, most of the former Diocese of Cornuaille, a canton and two parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vannes|Diocese of Vannes]], and parts of the former [[Ancient Diocese of Dol|Diocese of Dol]]; Quimper, however, handed over some of its eastern parishes to Vannes and to Saint-Brieuc.<ref>Paul Peyron, in: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 bibliographique (France) (1907), ''L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais...'', p. 491.</ref>  Quimper returned to its status as a suffragan of Tours.

She won the 1936 Olympic Rally, the first and last time after 1900 that an automobile race was part of the Olympic Games.\n\n== Biography ==\n===Early years===\nHaig was born in [[Marylebone]], London in 1905.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/><ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/><ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/>\n\nShe was an member of the Scottish [[Haig (whisky)|whisky-distilling Haig]] family.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/> Her father was Colonel Oliver Haig. She was also the grand-niece of Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the Western Front from 1915 to 1919. Her earliest years were spent in the family home in Ramornie in Fife, Scotland.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/> In the early 1920s her parents divorced, and Haig moved to Sussex with her mother and brother.\n\nAs a young girl Haig pursued equestrian sports such as riding, hunting and show-jumping.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> While still a schoolgirl she was taken for a ride in the [[Fiat Mephistopheles]].<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> At 14 she bought her first motorised vehicle; a surplus 2\u00be&nbsp;hp [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle, and at the age of 16 Haig bought her first car with a gift of \u00a350 from a Great Aunt.<ref name=\"70s-mar2016\"/> This car was destroyed in a fire, and Haig earned money towards the cost of its replacement, an Austin 7 Sports, by selling her story to the press at \u00a310 each.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/> The same year that the Austin was purchased she first did a lap at [[Brooklands]] in boyfriend Dennis Spragg's Talbot 8. She also attended the very first [[British Grand Prix]] in 1926.\n\nHaig and Spragg married, but the union did not last. For a time, either during the marriage or shortly after it ended, she lived in Africa.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/><ref name=\"retrospeed\"/>\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce Haig returned to England. She and flatmate Joyce Lambert bought two 600&nbsp;cc [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] motorcycles, which they used to tour across Europe.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\nOther purchases on her return to England included a variety of cars, including a second Morgan and a variety of MGs.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s (the year is reported to have been either 1930 or 1933), Betty crashed her Morgan Super Sport on the Kingston bypass, killing passenger Molly Watkins.<ref name=\"retrospeed\"/><ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\n===Racing===\n[[File:Singer 1,5-Litre Le Mans 2-Seater Sports 1934.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A 1934 Singer 1\u00bd-Litre Le Mans 2-seater Sport.]]\nThe first race Haig entered was the Junior Racing Drivers Club Speed Hill Climb Chalfont St Peter in 1934, which she ran with her recently acquired Singer Nine Le Mans, registration AKV 795.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/><ref name=\"500oa\"/> That same year she and Lambert entered the [[Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin]]. The duo completed the race, and Haig's report to Singer on the car's performance earned her factory support for return to the event in 1936, which she drove solo but suffered a gearbox failure during the race.\n\nHaig's first appearance at an event held on a racing track was in 1935 at the JCC High Speed Trials, where she drove her Aston Martin.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/>\n\nIn 1936 Haig won a gold medal for finishing first in the Olympic Rally held in conjunction with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"williamsbook\"/> Haig used a six-cylinder Singer Nine Le Mans in the race, and was accompanied by co-driver Lambert.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\nOn 7 May 1938 Haig was injured at Brooklands, but not while driving. A Delage had caught fire while at speed and as driver Joseph Paul tried to exit the track his car was struck by the Darracq driven by A. C. Lace, sending the burning Delage through the fencing and down into the off-track area. Haig was among eleven injured. There was also one death.<ref name=\"goldenage-1938\"/>\n\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Haig worked as a journalist, authoring articles and race reports for popular magazine [[Motor Sport]].\n\n===Later years===\nIn the post-war years, beginning in the 1950s, Haig tended to favour club events and hillclimbs over the larger events. \n\nShe made regular appearances at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]], among other locations, through the 1950s.<ref name=\"goodwood\"/> During this period Haig was also driving open-wheeled single-seaters, racing a Cooper 1000 in 1950 and a Cooper 500 the next year.<ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nShe won the National Ladies Hillclimb Championship two years running in 1960 and 1961 in a Coventry-Climax powered Lotus Seven.<ref name=\"lf-jan2003\"/>\nHaig held the Ladies\u2019 hillclimb record at [[Prescott Speed Hill Climb|Prescott]] for six years.<ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nIn 1966 Haig and photographer Guy Griffiths established the Historic Sports Car Club (HSCC).<ref name=\"hscc\"/>\n\nHaig was also a charter member of such clubs as the Frazer Nash car Club<ref name=\"fncc\"/> and the Porsche Club of Great Britain.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/>\n\nIn her later years Haig resided at Shellingford House, a former vicarage, in [[Shellingford]], Oxfordshire.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/><ref name=\"berkshire-hist\"/> She lived there with her frequent co-driver and long-time companion Barbara Marshall until the latter's death in early 1977.<ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/><ref name=\"msm-feb1977\"/>\n\nHaig died early in 1987.<ref name=\"msm-jul1987\"/><ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nHaig is memorialised by events such as the Triple-M Register's Betty Haig Cup for best racing performance of the year, the Betty Haig Memorial Trophy for the fastest time by a lady competitor in a racing car at Prescott, and the AC Owners' Club's Betty Haig Trophy for fastest lady member on handicap at Goodwood.<ref name=\"mmm-contact\"/>\n\n==Cars==\nOver the course of her life Haig owned a large number of vehicles, with one magazine article reporting that she had owned more than 60 cars by the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> The list included both road cars and purpose-built racers, with representatives from marques like A.B.C., A.C. Cars, Alvis, Aston Martin, Austin, Austin-Healy, BMW, Bugatti, Cooper, Elva, Frazer Nash, H.R.G., Healey, Jaguar, Lotus, MG, Morgan, Morris, Salmson, Singer, Triumph, and Turner, among others. Some of the most significant cars are listed below.\n\n* 1922 [[ABC (1920 automobile)|A.B.C.]] \u2014 This air-cooled, flat-twin powered roadster was Haig's very first car.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/>\n\n* 1934 [[Singer Nine#Le Mans|Singer Nine Le Mans]] Sports Special \u2014 This 1\u00bd&nbsp;lire OHC straight-six model, registration BLN 291, was the car Haig drove to a Gold medal victory in the 1936 Olympic rally.<ref name=\"silverstone-singer\"/>\n\n* 1953 [[Austin-Healey 100]] \u2014 Purchased by Haig on 16 July 1953, this car was an aluminium-bodied pre-production example, and the first right-hand drive car built.<ref name=\"rawles-ah100\"/> Registered as NUE 854, Haig drove this car in the 1954 Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin.\n\n* 1954 [[AC Ace]] - Chassis number AE 01, registered as UPJ 75, this was the first AC Ace built by AC Cars.<ref name=\"bonhams-2018\"/>\n\n* 1958 [[Lotus Seven]] \u2014 In 1960 Haig bought Chassis #421, registered as VGJ4. Essentially a [[Lotus Eleven]] with Seven bodywork, this car came with a [[de Dion tube]] rear suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and a {{cvt|1460|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Coventry Climax#FW|Coventry-Climax FWB]] engine tuned to [[Formula Two]] (F2) specifications.<ref name=\"lf-jan2003\"/>\n\n* [[BMW 328]] \u2014 Haig managed to trim \u00a3300 off the \u00a3700 price of the car by buying it jointly with roommate and racing driver [[Enid Riddell]], who did not have permanent British residency, and registering it in Budapest, rather than England. The car had registry number EYW 3.<ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/>\n\n* [[Jaguar XKSS]] \u2014 A D-Type brought to full XKSS spec., this was Haig's fastest road car. Originally registered as WVM 3, it was re-registered as BLH 7.<ref name=\"cc-xkss\"/>\n\n== Racing career ==\n[[File:Betty Haig, victorieuse du Rallye Paris-Saint-Raphael F\u00e9minin en 1938, sur M.G.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Betty Haig winner of the 1938 Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin in an MG PB.]]\n* Olympic Rally\n** 1936 \u2014 Overall win with co-driver Joyce Lambert, in a [[Singer Motors|Singer]] Le Mans 1500.\n\n*  [[Alpine Rally|Rallye des Alpes Fran\u00e7aises]]\n** 1946 \u2014 Second place with a class win in the 2&nbsp;L class and the Coupe des Dames trophy, driving a 1937 [[AC Cars|AC]] 16/80 Competition Sports, registration EPJ 101.<ref name=\"teamdan\"/> Co-driver Enid Riddell.\n** 1949 \u2014 Seventh overall and class win in the 1.5&nbsp;L class and the Coupe des Dames with co-driver Barbara Marshall in an [[MG T-type#TC|MG TC]].\n\n* [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]\n** [[1951 24 Hours of Le Mans|1951]] \u2014 Fifteenth place and third in class in the [[Luigi Chinetti]] 2&nbsp;L [[Ferrari 166|Ferrari 166MM Coup\u00e9]] with co-driver [[Yvonne Simon]].\n\n* [[Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin]]:<ref name=\"speedqueens-psr\"/>\n** 1938 \u2014 First place in an [[MG P-type#MG PB|MG PB]], and performance index<ref name=\"gallica\"/>\n** 1939 \u2014 Third place in an MG.\n** 1951 \u2014 Third place in an [[MG T-type#TD|MG TD]], with a class win.\n** 1954 \u2014 Seventh overall and a class win in the 2000\u20133000&nbsp;cc class, and a Coupe de Vitesse.

She won the 1936 Olympic Rally, the first and last time after 1900 that an automobile race was part of the Olympic Games.\n\n== Biography ==\n===Early years===\nHaig was born in [[Marylebone]], London in 1905.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/><ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/><ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/>\n\nShe was an member of the Scottish [[Haig (whisky)|whisky-distilling Haig]] family.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/> Her father was Colonel Oliver Haig. She was also the grand-niece of Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the Western Front from 1915 to 1919. Her earliest years were spent in the family home in Ramornie in Fife, Scotland.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/> In the early 1920s her parents divorced, and Haig moved to Sussex with her mother and brother.\n\nAs a young girl Haig pursued equestrian sports such as riding, hunting and show-jumping.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> While still a schoolgirl she was taken for a ride in the [[Fiat Mephistopheles]].<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> At 14 she bought her first motorised vehicle; a surplus 2\u00be&nbsp;hp [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle, and at the age of 16 Haig bought her first car with a gift of \u00a350 from a Great Aunt.<ref name=\"70s-mar2016\"/> This car was destroyed in a fire, and Haig earned money towards the cost of its replacement, an Austin 7 Sports, by selling her story to the press at \u00a310 each.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/> The same year that the Austin was purchased she first did a lap at [[Brooklands]] in boyfriend Dennis Spragg's Talbot 8. She also attended the very first [[British Grand Prix]] in 1926.\n\nHaig and Spragg married, but the union did not last. For a time, either during the marriage or shortly after it ended, she lived in Africa.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/><ref name=\"retrospeed\"/>\n\nAfter finalizing her divorce Haig returned to England. She and flatmate Joyce Lambert bought two 600&nbsp;cc [[Raleigh Bicycle Company|Raleigh]] motorcycles, which they used to tour across Europe.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\nOther purchases on her return to England included a variety of cars, including a second Morgan and a variety of MGs.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/>\n\nIn the early 1930s (the year is reported to have been either 1930 or 1933), Betty crashed her Morgan Super Sport on the Kingston bypass, killing passenger Molly Watkins.<ref name=\"retrospeed\"/><ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\n===Racing===\n[[File:Singer 1,5-Litre Le Mans 2-Seater Sports 1934.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A 1934 Singer 1\u00bd-Litre Le Mans 2-seater Sport.]]\nThe first race Haig entered was the Junior Racing Drivers Club Speed Hill Climb Chalfont St Peter in 1934, which she ran with her recently acquired Singer Nine Le Mans, registration AKV 795.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/><ref name=\"500oa\"/> That same year she and Lambert entered the [[Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin]]. The duo completed the race, and Haig's report to Singer on the car's performance earned her factory support for return to the event in 1936, which she drove solo but suffered a gearbox failure during the race.\n\nHaig's first appearance at an event held on a racing track was in 1935 at the JCC High Speed Trials, where she drove her Aston Martin.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/>\n\nIn 1936 Haig won a gold medal for finishing first in the Olympic Rally held in conjunction with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"williamsbook\"/> Haig used a six-cylinder Singer Nine Le Mans in the race, and was accompanied by co-driver Lambert.<ref name=\"CaSC-aug2019\"/>\n\nOn 7 May 1938 Haig was injured at Brooklands, but not while driving. A Delage had caught fire while at speed and as driver Joseph Paul tried to exit the track his car was struck by the Darracq driven by A. C. Lace, sending the burning Delage through the fencing and down into the off-track area. Haig was among eleven injured. There was also one death.<ref name=\"goldenage-1938\"/>\n\nBeginning in the late 1940s, Haig worked as a journalist, authoring articles and race reports for popular magazine [[Motor Sport]].\n\n===Later years===\nIn the post-war years, beginning in the 1950s, Haig tended to favour club events and hillclimbs over the larger events. \n\nShe made regular appearances at [[Goodwood Circuit|Goodwood]], among other locations, through the 1950s.<ref name=\"goodwood\"/> During this period Haig was also driving open-wheeled single-seaters, racing a Cooper 1000 in 1950 and a Cooper 500 the next year.<ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nShe won the National Ladies Hillclimb Championship two years running in 1960 and 1961 in a Coventry-Climax powered Lotus Seven.<ref name=\"lf-jan2003\"/>\nHaig held the Ladies\u2019 hillclimb record at [[Prescott Speed Hill Climb|Prescott]] for six years.<ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nIn 1966 Haig and photographer Guy Griffiths established the Historic Sports Car Club (HSCC).<ref name=\"hscc\"/>\n\nHaig was also a charter member of such clubs as the Frazer Nash car Club<ref name=\"fncc\"/> and the Porsche Club of Great Britain.<ref name=\"bbulliten\"/>\n\nIn her later years Haig resided at Shellingford House, a former vicarage, in [[Shellingford]], Oxfordshire.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/><ref name=\"berkshire-hist\"/> She lived there with her frequent co-driver and long-time companion Barbara Marshall until the latter's death in early 1977.<ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/><ref name=\"msm-feb1977\"/>\n\nHaig died early in 1987.<ref name=\"msm-jul1987\"/><ref name=\"500oa\"/>\n\nHaig is memorialised by events such as the Triple-M Register's Betty Haig Cup for best racing performance of the year, the Betty Haig Memorial Trophy for the fastest time by a lady competitor in a racing car at Prescott, and the AC Owners' Club's Betty Haig Trophy for fastest lady member on handicap at Goodwood.<ref name=\"mmm-contact\"/>\n\n==Cars==\nOver the course of her life Haig owned a large number of vehicles, with one magazine article reporting that she had owned more than 60 cars by the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/> The list included both road cars and purpose-built racers, with representatives from marques like A.B.C., A.C. Cars, Alvis, Aston Martin, Austin, Austin-Healy, BMW, Bugatti, Cooper, Elva, Frazer Nash, H.R.G., Healey, Jaguar, Lotus, MG, Morgan, Morris, Salmson, Singer, Triumph, and Turner, among others. Some of the most significant cars are listed below.\n\n* 1922 [[ABC (1920 automobile)|A.B.C.]] \u2014 This air-cooled, flat-twin powered roadster was Haig's very first car.<ref name=\"msm-jan1965\"/>\n\n* 1934 [[Singer Nine#Le Mans|Singer Nine Le Mans]] Sports Special \u2014 This 1\u00bd&nbsp;lire OHC straight-six model, registration BLN 291, was the car Haig drove to a Gold medal victory in the 1936 Olympic rally.<ref name=\"silverstone-singer\"/>\n\n* 1953 [[Austin-Healey 100]] \u2014 Purchased by Haig on 16 July 1953, this car was an aluminium-bodied pre-production example, and the first right-hand drive car built.<ref name=\"rawles-ah100\"/> Registered as NUE 854, Haig drove this car in the 1954 Rallye Paris - Saint-Rapha\u00ebl F\u00e9minin.\n\n* 1954 [[AC Ace]] - Chassis number AE 01, registered as UPJ 75, this was the first AC Ace built by AC Cars.<ref name=\"bonhams-2018\"/>\n\n* 1958 [[Lotus Seven]] \u2014 In 1960 Haig bought Chassis #421, registered as VGJ4. Essentially a [[Lotus Eleven]] with Seven bodywork, this car came with a [[de Dion tube]] rear suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and a {{cvt|1460|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Coventry Climax#FW|Coventry-Climax FWB]] engine tuned to [[Formula Two]] (F2) specifications.<ref name=\"lf-jan2003\"/>\n\n* [[BMW 328]] \u2014 Haig managed to trim \u00a3300 off the \u00a3700 price of the car by buying it jointly with roommate and racing driver [[Enid Riddell]], who did not have permanent British residency, and registering it in Budapest, rather than England. The car had registry number EYW 3.<ref name=\"cp-mar2019\"/>\n\n* [[Jaguar XKSS]] \u2014 A D-Type brought to full XKSS spec., this was Haig's fastest road car.

This was a huge drop relative to the rise in cases in 1980 of 106,480 cases. Similarly notable drops were in the number of murders in the violent crime category, with only an increase of 13 cases.<ref name=\":0\" /> While there is no determinate cause as to what led to this significant drop in all levels of crime, it was widely believed that new and harsh law enforcement initiatives and policies led to the decrease in crime in not just the state of Washington, but across the United States.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Stephen|date=Winter 2004|title=Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990s: Four Factors that Explain the Decline and Six that Do Not|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/089533004773563485|journal=Economic Perspectives|volume=18|pages=173 - 175|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /> The introduction of new gun control laws and laws allowing concealed carry was also believed to cause this reduction in crime, however the lack of evidence towards these claims dismissed the belief.<ref name=\":2\" /> Additionally, there is also data to suggest that increase in taxpayer costs contributed to the decrease in crime rates through funding towards the criminal justice system in Washington. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:U2rncl70wAkJ:www.wsipp.wa.gov/ReportFile/1072/Wsipp_WSIPP-s-Benefit-Cost-Tool-for-States-Examining-Policy-Options-in-Sentencing-and-Corrections_Presentation-to-the-Senate-Human-Services-Corrections-Committee-January-21-2011.pptx+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au|title=Crime Trends, Good News, What Works, and Analyzing Options|last=Aos|first=Stephen|date=2011-01-21|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\nIn 2008, there were 268,624 crimes reported in Washington, including 193 murders.<ref name=wac>{{cite web|author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/wacrime.htm |title=Washington Crime Rates 1960 - 2014 |publisher=Disastercenter.com |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> In 2014, there were 281,842 crimes reported, including 174 murders.<ref name=wac/>\n==Capital punishment laws==\n{{Main|Capital punishment in Washington state}}\nSince October 11th 2018, [[Capital punishment]] is no longer applied in this state.<ref>http://www.religioustolerance.org/execut3.htm</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Law of Washington]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Washington}}\n{{CrimeUS}}\n\n[[Category:Crime in Washington (state)| ]]\n\n\n{{crime-stub}}\n{{Washington-stub}}\n", "name_user": "JPanda1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added links to terms/things that could be help clarify understanding of the topic being discussed in a sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Washington"}
