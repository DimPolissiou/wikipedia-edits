It must have been a very sharp knife with a thin narrow blade, and must have been at least 6 to 8 inches in length, probably longer. He should say that the injuries could not have been inflicted by a bayonet or a sword bayonet. They could have been done by such an instrument as a medical man used for post-mortem purposes, but the ordinary surgical cases might not contain such an instrument. Those used by the [[Slaughterhouse|slaughtermen]], well ground down, might have caused them. He thought the knives used by those in the leather trade would not be long enough in the blade. There were indications of anatomical knowledge&nbsp;... he should say that the deceased had been dead at least two hours, and probably more, when he first saw her; but it was right to mention that it was a fairly cool morning, and that the body would be more apt to cool rapidly from its having lost a great quantity of blood. There was no evidence&nbsp;... of a struggle having taken place. He was positive the deceased entered the yard alive&nbsp;...\n\nA handkerchief was round the throat of the deceased when he saw it early in the morning. He should say it was not tied on after the throat was cut.<ref>''The Times'', 14 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 85\u201388</ref>}}\n[[File:Annie Chapman mortuary photo.jpg|thumb|160px|Mortuary photograph of Annie Chapman]]\nChapman's throat had been cut from left to right so deeply the bones of her [[vertebral column]] bore striations,<ref>''Jack the Ripper'' {{ISBN|978-1-848-68522-2}} p. 158</ref> and she had been [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], with a section of the flesh from her stomach being placed upon her left shoulder and another section of skin and flesh\u2014plus her [[small intestine]]s\u2014being removed and placed above her right shoulder.<ref>''The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-79040-9}} pp. 55-56</ref> The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing.

Palmer testified that Chapman had \"not as a regular means of livelihood\" been in the habit of selling sexual favours for money, adding she most often earned her income by performing crochet work or purchasing matches and flowers to sell for a small profit, and had only begun resorting to prostitution following the death of her husband in December 1886.

Ludwig was arrested very shortly after this incident in the company of a visibly distressed prostitute, who later informed a policeman: \"Dear me!

Chapman's parents were not married at the time of her birth, although they married on 22 February 1842, in Paddington.

Palmer testified that Chapman had \"not as a regular means of livelihood\" been in the habit of selling sexual favours for money, adding she most often earned her income by performing crochet work or purchasing matches and flowers to sell for a small profit, and had only begun resorting to prostitution following the death of her husband in December 1886.

On 9 September, a 53-year-old ship's cook named William Henry Piggott was detained after arriving at a [[Gravesend]] pub with a recent hand injury and shouting [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] remarks. A blood-stained shirt he had left in a local fish shop was quickly traced to Piggott, who claimed that he had been bitten by a woman, and that the blood on the shirt was his own.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 83</ref> He was investigated, but soon released from custody.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 89</ref>\n\nA Swiss butcher, [[Jacob Isenschmid]], matched an eyewitness description of a blood-stained man seen acting suspiciously on the morning of Chapman's murder by a public house landlady, a Mrs. Fiddymont. Isenschmid's distinctive appearance included a large ginger moustache, and he was known to have had a history of mental illness. He was arrested on suspicion of committing Chapman's murder on 13 September.<ref>''Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia'' {{ISBN|978-1-844-54982-5}} p. 216</ref>\n\nOn 18 September, a 40-year-old German hairdresser named Charles Ludwig was arrested after he attempted to stab a young man named Alexander Finlay at a coffee stall while intoxicated. Ludwig was arrested very shortly after this incident in the company of a visibly distressed prostitute, who later informed a policeman: \"Dear me! He frightened me very much when he pulled a big knife out.\" Ludwig was also known to have been wanted by the [[City of London Police]] for attempting to slash a woman's throat with a razor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.casebook.org/press_reports/daily_telegraph/dt880919.html |title=The Daily Telegraph: Wednesday 19 September 1888 |publisher=casebook.org |date=2 April 2004 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIsenschmid and Ludwig were both ultimately cleared of suspicion after two further murders were committed on the same date while both were in police custody.

She was laid to rest in a communal grave within Manor Park Cemetery, [[Forest Gate]], east London. At the request of Chapman's family, the funeral was not publicised, with no mourning [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]] used throughout the service, and only the [[undertaker]], police, and her relatives knowing of these arrangements. Resultingly, her family members were the only mourners to attend the service.<ref>''Ripper Notes: Death in London's East End'' {{ISBN|978-0-975-91295-9}} p. 94</ref>\n\nA hearse supplied by Hanbury Street undertaker H. Smith travelled to the Whitechapel Mortuary in Montague Street to collect Chapman's body at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Her body was placed in an [[elm]] coffin draped in black and was then driven to a Spitalfields undertaker named Harry Hawes, who arranged the funeral. Chapman's relatives met the hearse outside the cemetery.

Deitz and his family purchased a farmstead on the Thornapple River about 2 miles south of here. Deitz soon discovered that Cameron Dam -- one of many logging dams on this important tributary of the Chippewa River -- lay on his property. He thereupon claimed that the Chippewa Lumber & Boom Co., a Weyerhaeuser affiliate, owed him a toll for logs driven downriver. For four years he refused to permit logs to be sluiced down the Thornapple, defending \"his\" dam at gunpoint and successfully resisting attempts to arrest him. At least one deputy and two of Deitz's children were wounded in confrontations. In becoming an outlaw, Deitz also became a folk hero with a nationwide following. In October 1910, a large sheriff's posse surrounded his house. In the ensuing gun battle, Oscar Harp, a deputy, was killed. John Deitz surrendered, stood trial for murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 10 years, but public pressure eventually convinced Gov. John J. Blain to pardon him in May 1921. Deitz died in 1924. Cameron Dam has long since disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wisconsin Historical Markers: Marker 316: John Deitz \"Battle of Cameron Dam\"|url = http://wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.blogspot.com/2013/06/marker-316-john-deitz-battle-of-cameron.html?_sm_au_=iRVPQqnDMQSq3QFN|website = wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.blogspot.com|access-date = 2016-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n''\"'[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308202004/http://www.wisconsinosity.com/Sawyer/articles/defender_of_cameron_dam_was_icon.htm Defender of Cameron Dam' was icon for the underdog]\"'' article by Dennis McCann.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1910 in American politics]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1910|Cameron Dam]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement operations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Sawyer County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:1910 in Wisconsin]]\n\n\n{{Wisconsin-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Deitz 2162714993 58febc2aec o.jpg|thumb|400px]]\n\n'''John F.

Deitz and his family purchased a farmstead on the Thornapple River about 2 miles south of here. Deitz soon discovered that Cameron Dam -- one of many logging dams on this important tributary of the Chippewa River -- lay on his property. He thereupon claimed that the Chippewa Lumber & Boom Co., a Weyerhaeuser affiliate, owed him a toll for logs driven downriver. For four years he refused to permit logs to be sluiced down the Thornapple, defending \"his\" dam at gunpoint and successfully resisting attempts to arrest him. At least one deputy and two of Deitz's children were wounded in confrontations. In becoming an outlaw, Deitz also became a folk hero with a nationwide following. In October 1910, a large sheriff's posse surrounded his house. In the ensuing gun battle, Oscar Harp, a deputy, was killed. John Deitz surrendered, stood trial for murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He served 10 years, but public pressure eventually convinced Gov. John J. Blain to pardon him in May 1921. Deitz died in 1924. Cameron Dam has long since disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wisconsin Historical Markers: Marker 316: John Deitz \"Battle of Cameron Dam\"|url = http://wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.blogspot.com/2013/06/marker-316-john-deitz-battle-of-cameron.html?_sm_au_=iRVPQqnDMQSq3QFN|website = wisconsinhistoricalmarkers.blogspot.com|access-date = 2016-01-21}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n''\"'[https://web.archive.org/web/20160308202004/http://www.wisconsinosity.com/Sawyer/articles/defender_of_cameron_dam_was_icon.htm Defender of Cameron Dam' was icon for the underdog]\"'' article by Dennis McCann.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1910 in American politics]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1910|Cameron Dam]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement operations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Sawyer County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:1910 in Wisconsin]]\n\n\n{{Wisconsin-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Alaney2k", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:the work's name is \"The New York Times\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cameron_Dam"}

It is a [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] of Ireland and among the best-preserved medieval monastic sites in the country.  Though usually referred to by locals as \"Ross Abbey,\" this is not technically correct as the community never had an [[abbot]].<ref>Mooney 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nThe church and bell tower are to the south of a small but well preserved central [[cloister]] and domestic buildings are to the north.   Amongst these are a kitchen (equipped with an oven and a water tank for live fish), a bake house, and a refectory or dining area.  The dormitories are on the upper levels.  One unusual feature is a second courtyard or cloister, built to accommodate the friary's growing population.\n\nLike many other abandoned Christian sites in Ireland, Ross Errilly has continued to be used as a burial ground by area residents.  In addition to tombs that date from the friary's active period, many graves dating from the 18th through 20th centuries can be found inside the church walls.  In some cases, tombstones comprise the floors of walkways and crawlspaces.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Foundation ===\nBoth [[Luke Wadding]] and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]] (who refer to Ross Errilly in their Annals as ''Ros-Oirbhealagh'') record that the abbey was founded in 1351, but this date has been called into question by numerous historians.  Architectural cues and documentary evidence have given rise to a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime in the middle of the 15th century, perhaps around 1460.<ref>Mooney 12.</ref> The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469. But on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly, history tells us that there was a plague \u2013 the \"Black Death\" rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years. Secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam. He was a Franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349, and it could have taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil.<ref group=note>\"The Friary of Ross\" a History and a Guide.</ref> In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the [[Tyrconnell]] clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.\n\n=== After the English Reformation ===\n\nLife at Ross Errilly was disrupted by the [[English Reformation]].  The Franciscans had loudly opposed [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII's]] break with Rome, which would prove costly after the schism.  In 1538, English authorities imprisoned two hundred of the monks and banished or killed an indeterminate number of others.  The rest of the Franciscans' history at Ross Errilly would be marked by repeated evictions and other persecutions.\n\n[[Image:Refriary fish.jpg|300px|thumb|Right|This tank was used to hold live fish caught from the nearby [[Black River (Ireland)|Black River]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], the abbey was confiscated and given to Richard Burgh, the 2nd [[Earl of Clanrickarde]].  Burgh, a descendant of the de Burghs who had helped found the abbey, quietly gave it back to the Franciscans.  In 1572, an enclosing ditch and wall were constructed around the friary.<ref>Stalley 9.</ref>\n\nIn 1584, the English crown again confiscated the monastery from the Franciscans and gave it to an English noble who evicted the monks and plundered the building's contents.  In 1586, the Earl of Clanrickarde purchased the monastery and again returned it to the Franciscans.\n\nBy the end of the century, however, the crown had once again expelled the monks and converted the monastery into an English garrison for use during the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].\n\nIn 1604, Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanrickarde, continuing to honour the de Burgh tradition of supporting Ross Errilly, financed the rehabilitation and reoccupation of the monastery by the Franciscans.  Their stay was short-lived; in 1612 Lord Arthur Chichester, [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Deputy of Ireland]], ordered the [[Protestant archbishop of Tuam]], William Daniel, to expel the monks and to demolish the abbey's altars.  Daniel apparently complied with the order, but sent advance word to the residents of Ross Errilly and advised them to evacuate the abbey's most precious items.\n\nIn 1626, the monks returned to Ross Errilly and enjoyed a quarter-century of relative peace.  Records of the [[Franciscan|OFM]] in Ireland indicate that the community at this time consisted of just six priests and two brothers.  One piece of evidence for the friary's occupancy during this period is a handwritten [[testimony|testimonium]], dated 27 November 1636, and signed by a Boetius Mac Egan, then a [[prelate]] in residence at the friary.<ref>{{cite book | last = O'Donovan | first = John (trans.) | authorlink = John O'Donovan (scholar)|editor=[[James Henthorn Todd|Todd, James H.]] |editor2=[[William Reeves (bishop)|Reeves, William]] |title=The Martyrology of Donegal: A Calendar of the Saints of Ireland | url = https://archive.org/details/TheMartyrologyOfDonegal |year=1864 |publisher=Irish Archaeological and Celtic Society |location=Dublin |language=English, Latin | nopp = true |page=liii }}</ref>\n\n=== Rebellion and the Cromwellian era ===\n\nOn 18 February 1642, Ulick Burke and the monks were involved in the rescue of about 40 Protestant refugees of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 uprising]], including the family of Dr. John Maxwell, the Protestant bishop of [[Killala]]. The refugees were being led from the town of [[Shrule]] when the Catholic soldiers comprising their escort massacred them.  It's not reliably known how many were killed, but one estimate placed the number of victims at 65.  Burke and the monks brought the survivors back to the Headford area and obtained shelter for them among the townspeople until safe passage to England could be arranged.\n\nThe [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Irish campaigns]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] brought an end to this era of English tolerance of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  For a few nervous years, Ross Errilly served as an informal refugee shelter for Catholic clergy who had been flushed out of other parts of Ireland by Cromwell's forces.\n\nOn 10 August 1656, Cromwellian forces finally made their way to Ross Errilly.  The 140 Franciscans living there had fled a few hours earlier, but the soldiers ransacked the grounds, destroying crosses and other religious iconography and even defiling tombs in search of loot.  Legend maintains that the fleeing monks somehow found the time to remove the bell from the bell tower and sink it in the nearby Black River, where it remains today.  The [[English Restoration]] in 1660 brought [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the throne. His nominally tolerant policies towards Catholics allowed the reoccupation and repair of the abbey in 1664.\n\n=== Final years ===\n\nThe [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], which deposed Charles' younger brother, the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]], eventually led to the [[Popery Act 1698|Popery Act of 1698]], which placed a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Catholic clergy.  Once again, the Franciscans of Ross Errilly became fugitives and abandoned the premises.\n\nLocal records indicate that by 1712, Franciscans had returned to the abbey.  Some sources indicate that the abbey was abandoned again in 1731, for reasons which are unclear.  What's certain is that by 1753, they had returned to the site.  The property was now owned by Lord St. George, a local noble, who picked up where the Clanrickardes had left off and secretly patronised the abbey.  By this time, the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] were in effect and St. George risked life imprisonment by supporting the monks. A vengeful family who had lost a [[lawsuit]] to St. George reported to the authorities that he was sheltering Catholic religious at the monastery.  St. George learned of the accusations and the monks evacuated the monastery for the last time.  Before authorities arrived at the abbey, St. George had the abbey's interior whitewashed and had employed a group of [[weaving|weavers]] and their [[loom]]s inside the building.  The inquiry was ended without further incident, but the sham factory was soon closed and the monks never returned again.\n\nThe monks built cabins of wood and stone on a small island in the Black River, about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) downstream from the abbey.  The island (which no longer exists) was known informally as \"Friars Island,\" and the community supported the monks with food, fuel and clothing via a wooden drawbridge.  For 36 years, the monks continued to celebrate Sunday [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the deteriorating abbey building.  In 1789, a Henry Lynch of [[Ballycurrin]] cheaply leased {{convert|16|acre|m2}} to the dispossessed monks at the foot of a hill in the [[townland]] of Kilroe, near Headford.  By 1801, only three monks remained, though mass continued to be said at Kilroe until 1804.  There were still three monks in the community when it was closed in 1832.\n\n=== Abandonment and neglect ===\n\n[[Image:Rossabbey.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The abbey ruins as depicted in [[William Wilde]]'s 1867 book, ''[[Lough Corrib]], Its Shores and Islands''.]]\n\nIn the meantime, the long-abandoned friary continued its descent into ruin.  In 1835, English tourist John Barrow described the abbey as \"a remarkably fine old ruin...in a disgracefully neglected state.\"  In particular, Barrow was astonished by the large amount of unburied human remains at the site, which included \"moss-grown skulls and human thigh and leg-bones strewed about so plentifully that not a step can be taken without encountering them.\"<ref>Barrow, John. ''A Tour Round Ireland, Through the Sea-coast Counties, in the Autumn of 1835.'' London. John Murray, Albemarle Street. 1836. p.260.</ref> Geographer [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] noted the continued decay in 1837, writing that the abbey was \"partially covered in ivy\" and that the roof had collapsed in 1812.  Despite the neglect, Lewis was able to report that \"one of the windows is still perfect.\"<ref>{{cite web  | last = Lewis  | first = Samuel  | authorlink = Samuel Lewis (publisher)  | title = A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland  | publisher = Samuel Lewis  | year = 1837  | url = http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/h.php | accessdate = 24 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[William Wilde]] visited the abbey ruins in July 1866.  Like Barrow, he described \"heaps of skulls and bones\" in the church and claimed that the site had become notorious for its unburied remains.  Wilde noted with dismay that further \"desecration\" was being effected by sheep and cattle, which roamed freely through the ruins.  He also credited a nearby resident, Oliver Burke, with some early efforts to preserve the site by \"removing obstructions from between the [[mullion]]s of the beautiful windows\" and making \"repairs to the tower, thereby rendering it accessible to the top.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Lough Corrib, its shores and islands: with notices of Lough Mask |last=Wilde |first=William |authorlink=William Wilde |year=1867 |publisher=M.H.

It has been used as a filming location for ''[[Bad Karma (2002 film)|Bad Karma]]'', The Suicide Club, Moving Target & series Reign.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[List of abbeys and priories in Ireland#County Galway|List of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Galway)]]\n* [[Headford]]\n* [[Soraca Jonin]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation | last = Mooney  | first = Canice | title = The Friary of Ross: Foundation and Early Years  | journal = Journal of the Galway Archaeological and Historical Society | volume = 29  | pages = 7\u201314 | year = 1960 }}\n* {{Citation | last = Stalley  | first = Roger | title = The End of the Middle Ages: Gothic Survival in Sixteenth-Century Connacht  | journal = The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland | volume = 133  | pages = 5\u201323 | year = 2003 }}\n\n== External links==\n{{more footnotes|article|date=February 2008}}\n\n* [http://franciscans.ie/content/view/74/35/ Ross Abbey] at Irish Franciscans OFM\n* [http://www.irelandoldnews.com/Galway/1909/AUG.html Tuam Herald, Saturday, August 7 1909] at Ireland Old News\n* [http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/abbeyrosserrily/ The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol. V, No. I, October 1868] at Library Ireland\n* [http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/ShruelDPJ1-33/index.php The Dublin Penny Journal, Volume 1, Number 33, February 9, 1833] at Library Ireland\n* [http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/h.php A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland by Samuel Lewis] at Library Ireland\n* [http://www.headford.org/ross.htm History of Ross Abbey] at Headford.ie\n* [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005C/index.html The Annals of the Four Masters] at University College Cork\n* [http://www.lawrencetown.com/longago.htm Long Ago in Ireland] at Lawrencetown Village, Co.

Like Barrow, he described \"heaps of skulls and bones\" in the church and claimed that the site had become notorious for its unburied remains.  Wilde noted with dismay that further \"desecration\" was being effected by sheep and cattle, which roamed freely through the ruins.  He also credited a nearby resident, Oliver Burke, with some early efforts to preserve the site by \"removing obstructions from between the [[mullion]]s of the beautiful windows\" and making \"repairs to the tower, thereby rendering it accessible to the top.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Lough Corrib, its shores and islands: with notices of Lough Mask |last=Wilde |first=William |authorlink=William Wilde |year=1867 |publisher=M.H.

The first battle resulted in a Chadian victory, while the second battle, a Libyan counteroffensive, is deemed to have been won by Libya. It was the only Libyan victory of the Toyota War.\n\n==First Battle==\nIn late 1987, the [[Chadian National Armed Forces]] (FANT) were in the process of retaking northern Chad from Libya. The battle for the [[Aouzou Strip]] \u2014 a strip of land in northern Chad then controlled by Libya \u2014 began in late July. After suffering a string of defeats, the [[Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan Army]] organized a counteroffensive on 8 August in an attempt to regain a foothold in the nearby [[Tibesti Mountains]]. As the 3,000-strong Libyan force drove southwards, towards the Tibesti town of [[Barda\u00ef]], they were intercepted by the FANT, which surrounded and attacked them on multiple sides, forcing them to retreat. The Chadians then began aggressively pursuing the Libyans northwards through the desert, towards Aouzou, inflicting numerous casualties along the way to the Libyan Army, which suffered 650 killed, 147 captured, 111 military vehicles captured, and at least 30 [[tank]]s and [[armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] were destroyed. With the Libyans routed, the FANT troops easily moved into the town of Aouzou that same day; however, this move went against the advice of the [[France]]'s president and Chadian ally [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], who refused to provide air support for the operation.<ref name=pollack /><ref>{{Cite book|author=Nolutshungu, Sam C.|author-link=Sam Nolutshungu|title=Limits of Anarchy: Intervention and State Formation in Chad|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1995|isbn=0-8139-1628-3|page=222}}</ref>\n\n==Second Battle==\nThe loss of Aouzou infuriated Libya's leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who ordered its recapture. He sent Ali ash-Sharif, who was widely considered to be Libya's most capable general, along with 15,000 troops to retake the town. The Libyans began bombarding the town with artillery and airstrikes to soften up the Chadian positions.

Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s.

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]].
