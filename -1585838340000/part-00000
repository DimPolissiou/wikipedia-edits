Hutton]] and starring [[Richard Burton]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Mary Ure]]. It was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], filmed in [[Panavision]], and shot on location in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]]. [[Alistair MacLean]] wrote the screenplay, his first, at the same time that he wrote the novel of the same name. Both became commercial successes.\n\nThe film involved some of the top filmmakers of the day and is now considered a classic.<ref name = \"TCM\"/> Major contributors included Hollywood [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Yakima Canutt]], who as [[Second unit|second-unit]] director shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman [[Alf Joint]] who doubled for Burton in such sequences as the fight on top of the cable car; [[Ivor Novello Awards|award-winning]] conductor and composer [[Ron Goodwin]], who wrote the [[film score]]; and future [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominee]] [[Arthur Ibbetson]], who worked on its [[cinematography]]. The film is noted for the phrase \"Broadsword calling Danny Boy\", spoken  by Richard Burton several times throughout. The phrase is frequently used by Richard Burton [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the winter of [[Timeline of World War II (1943)|1943]]\u2013[[Timeline of World War II (1944)|44]], [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] George Carnaby ([[Robert Beatty]]), a chief planner for the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], is captured by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]. He is taken for interrogation to ''Schlo\u00df Adler'' ([[Hohenwerfen Castle]]), a mountaintop fortress accessible only by [[aerial tramway|cable car]] or helicopter. A team of seven Allied [[commando]]s, led by British Major John Smith of the [[Grenadier Guards]] ([[Richard Burton]]) and [[U.S. Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Morris Schaffer ([[Clint Eastwood]]), is briefed by Colonel Turner ([[Patrick Wymark]]) and Vice Admiral Rolland ([[Michael Hordern]]) of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Disguised as German troops, they are to parachute in, enter the castle, and rescue General Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After their [[Ju 52]] transport plane drops them into Germany, Smith secretly meets Mary Ellison ([[Mary Ure]]) and Heidi Schmidt ([[Ingrid Pitt]]), their presence known only to him; Heidi arranges for Mary to be a secretary at the castle.\n\nAlthough two of the team are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation, keeping Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner by radio. The Germans eventually surround the commandos in a tavern, and they are forced to surrender; Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the other three operatives, Thomas ([[William Squire]]), Berkeley ([[Peter Barkworth]]), and Christiansen ([[Donald Houston]]). Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a [[supply depot]], and prepare an escape route for later use. They reach the castle by riding on the roof of a cable car, and climb inside when Mary lowers a rope.\n\nGerman [[General]] Rosemeyer ([[Ferdy Mayne]]) and [[Standartenf\u00fchrer]] Kramer ([[Anton Diffring]]) are interrogating Carnaby when the four new prisoners arrive. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith forces Schaffer to disarm. He identifies himself as [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] Johann Schmidt of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] intelligence branch, and a spy too. As proof, he discreetly shows the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. To test them, Schmidt proposes that they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to his own list in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals that he was bluffing and that the lists were the mission's true objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary is visited by [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) von Hapen ([[Derren Nesbitt]]), a [[Gestapo]] officer attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story. Leaving her, he happens upon the scene of Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts everyone under arrest but is distracted when Mary arrives. Schaffer seizes the opportunity to kill von Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, taking the American General (who is actually a corporal named Jones, a trained actor) and three British Captains to the escape route. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle, while Smith leads the group to the radio room where he informs Rolland of their success. The group reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they had prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way on to an airfield and escape via their Ju 52 transport, where Turner has been waiting.\n\nAs Turner debriefs Smith about the mission, Smith reveals that the name Kramer confirmed as Germany's top agent in Britain was Turner's own. Rolland had lured Turner and the others into participating so MI6 could expose them; Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) had been assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a gun at Smith, who reveals that Rolland had the gun's firing pin removed. Smith permits Turner to jump out of the airplane to his death rather than face trial for treason, and subsequent hanging.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Clint Eastwood Ingrid Pitt Where Eagles Dare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Clint Eastwood]] as [[U.S. Army Ranger]] officer, with [[Ingrid Pitt]], as British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy]] -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as [[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj.]] John Smith / [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|Maj.]] Johann Schmidt\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Lieutenant (United States)|Lt.]] Morris Schaffer\n* [[Mary Ure]] as Mary Ellison\n* [[Patrick Wymark]] as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Col.]] Wyatt Turner\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] Rolland\n* [[Donald Houston]] as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt.]] Olaf Christiansen\n* [[Peter Barkworth]] as Capt.

One scene during the escape from the castle where Smith saves a German guard from burning to death presaged the non-lethal thriller vein that MacLean would explore in his later career. In the novel the characters are more clearly defined and slightly more humorous than their depictions in the film, which is fast-paced and has sombre performances from Burton and Eastwood at its centre. Three characters are differently named in the novel: Ted Berkeley is called Edward Carraciola, Jock MacPherson is called Torrance-Smythe, and Major von Hapen is instead Captain von Brauchitsch.

Hutton]] and starring [[Richard Burton]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Mary Ure]]. It was distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], filmed in [[Panavision]], and shot on location in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]]. [[Alistair MacLean]] wrote the screenplay, his first, at the same time that he wrote the novel of the same name. Both became commercial successes.\n\nThe film involved some of the top filmmakers of the day and is now considered a classic.<ref name = \"TCM\"/> Major contributors included Hollywood [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Yakima Canutt]], who as [[Second unit|second-unit]] director shot most of the action scenes; British stuntman [[Alf Joint]] who doubled for Burton in such sequences as the fight on top of the cable car; [[Ivor Novello Awards|award-winning]] conductor and composer [[Ron Goodwin]], who wrote the [[film score]]; and future [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominee]] [[Arthur Ibbetson]], who worked on its [[cinematography]]. The film is noted for the phrase \"Broadsword calling Danny Boy\", spoken  by Richard Burton several times throughout. The phrase is frequently used by Richard Burton [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nIn the winter of [[Timeline of World War II (1943)|1943]]\u2013[[Timeline of World War II (1944)|44]], [[U.S. Army]] [[Brigadier General]] George Carnaby ([[Robert Beatty]]), a chief planner for the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], is captured by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]. He is taken for interrogation to ''Schlo\u00df Adler'' ([[Hohenwerfen Castle]]), a mountaintop fortress accessible only by [[aerial tramway|cable car]] or helicopter. A team of seven Allied [[commando]]s, led by British Major John Smith of the [[Grenadier Guards]] ([[Richard Burton]]) and [[U.S. Army Ranger]] Lieutenant Morris Schaffer ([[Clint Eastwood]]), is briefed by Colonel Turner ([[Patrick Wymark]]) and Vice Admiral Rolland ([[Michael Hordern]]) of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Disguised as German troops, they are to parachute in, enter the castle, and rescue General Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him. After their [[Ju 52]] transport plane drops them into Germany, Smith secretly meets Mary Ellison ([[Mary Ure]]) and Heidi Schmidt ([[Ingrid Pitt]]), their presence known only to him; Heidi arranges for Mary to be a secretary at the castle.\n\nAlthough two of the team are mysteriously killed, Smith continues the operation, keeping Schaffer as a close ally and secretly updating Rolland and Turner by radio. The Germans eventually surround the commandos in a tavern, and they are forced to surrender; Smith and Schaffer (being officers) are separated from the other three operatives, Thomas ([[William Squire]]), Berkeley ([[Peter Barkworth]]), and Christiansen ([[Donald Houston]]). Smith and Schaffer kill their captors, blow up a [[supply depot]], and prepare an escape route for later use. They reach the castle by riding on the roof of a cable car, and climb inside when Mary lowers a rope.\n\nGerman [[General]] Rosemeyer ([[Ferdy Mayne]]) and [[Standartenf\u00fchrer]] Kramer ([[Anton Diffring]]) are interrogating Carnaby when the four new prisoners arrive. Smith and Schaffer intrude, weapons drawn, but Smith forces Schaffer to disarm. He identifies himself as [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] Johann Schmidt of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] intelligence branch, and a spy too. As proof, he discreetly shows the name of Germany's top agent in Britain to Kramer, who silently affirms it. To test them, Schmidt proposes that they write down the names of their fellow agents in Britain, to be compared to his own list in his pocket. After the three finish their lists, Smith reveals that he was bluffing and that the lists were the mission's true objective.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary is visited by [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]] (Major) von Hapen ([[Derren Nesbitt]]), a [[Gestapo]] officer attracted to her, but he becomes suspicious of flaws in her cover story. Leaving her, he happens upon the scene of Carnaby's interrogation just as Smith finishes his explanation. Von Hapen puts everyone under arrest but is distracted when Mary arrives. Schaffer seizes the opportunity to kill von Hapen and the other German officers with his silenced pistol. The group then makes its escape, taking the American General (who is actually a corporal named Jones, a trained actor) and three British Captains to the escape route. Schaffer sets explosives to create diversions around the castle, while Smith leads the group to the radio room where he informs Rolland of their success. The group reunites with Heidi on the ground, boarding a bus they had prepared earlier as an escape vehicle. They battle their way on to an airfield and escape via their Ju 52 transport, where Turner has been waiting.\n\nAs Turner debriefs Smith about the mission, Smith reveals that the name Kramer confirmed as Germany's top agent in Britain was Turner's own. Rolland had lured Turner and the others into participating so MI6 could expose them; Smith's trusted partner Mary and the American Schaffer (who had no connection to MI6) had been assigned to the mission to ensure its success. Turner aims a gun at Smith, who reveals that Rolland had the gun's firing pin removed. Smith permits Turner to jump out of the airplane to his death rather than face trial for treason, and subsequent hanging.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Clint Eastwood Ingrid Pitt Where Eagles Dare.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Clint Eastwood]] as [[U.S. Army Ranger]] officer, with [[Ingrid Pitt]], as British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] spy]] -->\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Richard Burton]] as [[Major (United Kingdom)|Maj.]] John Smith / [[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|Maj.]] Johann Schmidt\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as [[Lieutenant (United States)|Lt.]] Morris Schaffer\n* [[Mary Ure]] as Mary Ellison\n* [[Patrick Wymark]] as [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Col.]] Wyatt Turner\n* [[Michael Hordern]] as [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] Rolland\n* [[Donald Houston]] as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Capt.]] Olaf Christiansen\n* [[Peter Barkworth]] as Capt.

One scene during the escape from the castle where Smith saves a German guard from burning to death presaged the non-lethal thriller vein that MacLean would explore in his later career. In the novel the characters are more clearly defined and slightly more humorous than their depictions in the film, which is fast-paced and has sombre performances from Burton and Eastwood at its centre. Three characters are differently named in the novel: Ted Berkeley is called Edward Carraciola, Jock MacPherson is called Torrance-Smythe, and Major von Hapen is instead Captain von Brauchitsch. A budding love story between Schaffer and Heidi was also cut.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview22 | title = I capture the castle | newspaper = The Guardian | accessdate = 20 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the book the group are flown into Germany on board an RAF [[Avro Lancaster]], whereas in the film they are transported in a Luftwaffe [[Junkers Ju 52]]. While in the film Kramer, Rosemeyer, and Von Hapen are shot dead by Schaffer and Smith, in the novel they are just given high doses of [[nembutal]]. In the book Thomas, Carraciola, and Christiansen attempt to escape in the cable car with Smith on the roof. Carraciola is crushed by the steel suspension arm of the cable car while struggling with Smith on the roof; Thomas and Christiansen fall to their deaths after Smith blows the cable car up with plastic explosive. In the film Christiansen and Berkeley (Carraciola in the novel) are killed by Smith on the cablecar, and Thomas is shot and killed by a German soldier while climbing down a rope.<ref>https://warmoviebuff.blogspot.com/2015/07/bookmovie-where-eagles-dare-19671968.html?m=1</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]] recorded a song called \"Where Eagles Dare\" on their 1983 album ''[[Piece of Mind]]''.

To reach another person on the Internet, you need to type an address \u2013 a name or number \u2013 into your computer or other device. That address must be unique so computers know where to find each other. <abbr>ICANN</abbr> helps coordinate and support these unique identifiers across the world. \n\nMuch of its work is on the Internet's global [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), including policy development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic [[top-level domains]] (TLDs), and the operation of [[root name server]]s. The numbering facilities ICANN manages include the [[Internet Protocol]] address spaces for [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]], and assignment of address blocks to [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]]. ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers.\n\nICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]], consensus-based processes.<ref name=\"Memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and Internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers\"/>\n\nICANN's creation was announced publicly on September 17, 1998,<ref>{{cite web|last=Postel|first=Jonathan|title=A Brief Explanation of the Joint IANA and NSI Documents Defining the New Internet Corporation|url=http://www.netsol.com:80/policy/icann/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990219132906/http://www.netsol.com:80/policy/icann/|archive-date=1999-02-19}}</ref> and it formally came into being on September 30, 1998, incorporated in the U.S. state of California.<ref name=\"kepler.ss.ca.gov\"/> Originally headquartered in [[Marina del Rey]] in the same building as the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI), its offices are now in the [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles|Playa Vista]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n\n==History==\nBefore the establishment of ICANN, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function of administering registries of Internet protocol identifiers (including the distributing top-level domains and IP addresses) was performed by [[Jon Postel]], a Computer Science researcher who had been involved in the creation of [[ARPANET]], first at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and then at USC-ISI.<ref name=\"V.

After an open letter from ICANN issuing an ultimatum to VeriSign, later endorsed by the [[Internet Architecture Board]],<ref name=\"Wildcard entries in DNS entries\"/> the company voluntarily ended the service on October 4, 2003. After this action, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN on February 27, 2004, claiming that ICANN had exceeded its authority.

VeriSign's challenge that ICANN overstepped its contractual rights is currently outstanding. A proposed settlement already approved by ICANN's board would resolve VeriSign's challenge to ICANN in exchange for the right to increase pricing on .com domains.

It included proposals to increase the openness and professionalism of its operations, and greatly increased its proposed spending from US$8.27&nbsp;million to $15.83&nbsp;million. The increase was to be funded by the introduction of new [[top-level domain]]s, charges to [[Domain name registry|domain registries]], and a fee for some domain name registrations, renewals and transfers (initially USD 0.20 for all domains within a country-code top-level domain, and USD 0.25 for all others).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR), which represents the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|Internet registries]] of 39 countries, rejected the increase, accusing ICANN of a lack of financial prudence and criticizing what it describes as ICANN's \"unrealistic political and operational targets\".

However, the KnujOn report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).<ref name=\"icann2\"/> The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited registrars, fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[.events|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\" This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.<ref name=\"32nd International Public ICANN Meeting\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 2008, ICANN issued breach notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.<ref name=\"icann3\"/> after further researching reports and complaints issued by KnujOn.

As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.<ref name=\"participation\"/>\n\nICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time.

Summit to Focus on Internet\"/> followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government<ref name=\"2005-07-us\"/> and worries about a division of the Internet.<ref name=\"Power grab could split the net\"/> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.<ref name=\"icann_gac\"/>\n\nSome have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Activities==\n===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===\nOne task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP\u2014they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.\n\nExamination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some<ref name=\"vjolt\"/> to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.\n\n===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===\nIn 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be \"abandoned\". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or \"gated\") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois \"killer\" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions & Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.

The increase was to be funded by the introduction of new [[top-level domain]]s, charges to [[Domain name registry|domain registries]], and a fee for some domain name registrations, renewals and transfers (initially USD 0.20 for all domains within a country-code top-level domain, and USD 0.25 for all others).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR), which represents the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|Internet registries]] of 39 countries, rejected the increase, accusing ICANN of a lack of financial prudence and criticizing what it describes as ICANN's \"unrealistic political and operational targets\". Despite the criticism, the registry agreement for the top-level domains <tt>jobs</tt> and <tt>travel</tt> includes a US$2 fee on every domain the licensed companies sell or renew.<ref name=\"theregister\"/>\n\nAfter a second round of negotiations during 2004, the TLDs <tt>[[.eu|eu]]</tt>, <tt>[[.asia|{{not a typo|asia}}]]</tt>, <tt>[[.travel|travel]]</tt>, <tt>[[.jobs|jobs]]</tt>, <tt>[[.mobi|mobi]]</tt>, and <tt>[[.cat|cat]]</tt> were introduced during 2005.\n\n[[Image:Cerf's Up-marquee-20071031.jpg|thumb|ICANN meeting, Los Angeles USA, 2007. The sign refers to [[Vint Cerf]], then chairman of the board of directors, who is working on the so-called [[Interplanetary Internet]].]]\nOn February 28, 2006, ICANN's board approved a settlement with VeriSign in the lawsuit resulting from SiteFinder that involved allowing VeriSign (the registry) to raise its registration fees by up to 7% a year.<ref name=\"icann\"/> This was criticised by a few members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]' [[United States Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship|Small Business Committee]].<ref name=\"com\"/>\n\nDuring February 2007, ICANN began procedures to end accreditation of one of their registrars, [[RegisterFly]] amid charges and lawsuits involving fraud, and criticism of ICANN's management of the situation. ICANN has been the subject of criticism as a result of its handling of RegisterFly, and the harm caused to thousands of clients as a result of what has been termed ICANN's \"laissez faire attitude toward customer allegations of fraud\".<ref name=\"TheRegisterICANNCriticism1\"/>\n\nOn May 23, 2008, ICANN issued enforcement notices against ten accredited registrars and announced this through a press release entitled \"'Worst Spam Offenders' Notified by ICANN, Compliance system working to correct Whois and other issues.\"<ref name=\"icann1\"/> This was largely in response to a report issued by [[KnujOn]], called \"The 10 Worst Registrars\" in terms of spam advertised junk product sites and compliance failure.<ref name=\"knujon\"/> The mention of the word \"[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]\" in the title of the ICANN memo is somewhat misleading since ICANN does not address issues of spam or email abuse. Website content and usage are not within ICANN's mandate. However, the KnujOn report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).<ref name=\"icann2\"/> The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited registrars, fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[.events|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\" This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.<ref name=\"32nd International Public ICANN Meeting\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 2008, ICANN issued breach notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.<ref name=\"icann3\"/> after further researching reports and complaints issued by KnujOn. These notices gave the registrars 15 days to fix their Whois investigation efforts.\n\nIn 2010, ICANN approved a major review of its policies with respect to [[accountability]], transparency, and public participation by the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"icann4\"/> This external review was an assistance of the work of ICANN's Accountability and Transparency Review team.<ref name=\"icann5\"/>\n\nOn February 3, 2011, ICANN announced that it had distributed the last batch of its remaining IPv4 addresses to the world's five regional Internet registries, the organizations that manage IP addresses in different regions. These registries began assigning the final IPv4 addresses within their regions until they ran out completely.<ref name=\"icann6\"/>\n\nOn June 20, 2011, the ICANN board voted to end most restrictions on the names of [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD).<ref name=\"VOA\"/><ref name=\"yahoo\"/><ref name=\"zdnet\"/> Companies and organizations became able to choose essentially arbitrary top-level Internet domain names. The use of non-Latin characters (such as Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, etc.) is also allowed in gTLDs. ICANN began accepting applications for new gTLDS on January 12, 2012.<ref name=\"VOA\"/> The initial price to apply for a new gTLD was set at $185,000<ref name=\"bbc\"/> and the annual renewal fee is $25,000.<ref name=\"icann7\"/><ref name=\"mashable\"/>\n\nFollowing the 2013 [[NSA spying scandal]], ICANN endorsed the [[Montevideo Statement]],<ref name=montevideo>[https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2013-10-07-en Montevideo Statement on the Future of Internet Cooperation], ICANN, October 7, 2013.

As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.<ref name=\"participation\"/>\n\nICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time. However, there are criticisms from ICANN constituencies including the Noncommercial Users Constituency (NCUC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnso.icann.org/about/stakeholders-constituencies/ncsg/ncuc|title=Non-Commercial Users \u2013 Generic Names Supporting Organization|website=gnso.icann.org}}</ref> and the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) that there is not enough [[Freedom of information legislation|public disclosure]] and that too many discussions and decisions take place out of sight of the public.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nDuring the early 2000s, there had been speculation that the United Nations might assume control of ICANN,<ref name=\"U.N. Summit to Focus on Internet\"/> followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government<ref name=\"2005-07-us\"/> and worries about a division of the Internet.<ref name=\"Power grab could split the net\"/> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.<ref name=\"icann_gac\"/>\n\nSome have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Activities==\n===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===\nOne task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, domain registrants must agree to be bound by the UDRP\u2014they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.\n\nExamination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some<ref name=\"vjolt\"/> to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.\n\n===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===\nIn 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be \"abandoned\". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or \"gated\") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois \"killer\" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions & Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.

The aircraft saw combat in [[Battle of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nA key requirement of the original specification was that the aircraft be powered by engines that were not in demand for other designs. Prototypes with low-power german [[Argus As 410]] engines of {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}} failed acceptance test, a more powerful replacement was found with the french [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] engine of {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}}. \n\nThe design was relatively effective when it was first introduced, and saw service on the Eastern Front in a variety of front-line roles. As the war continued and anti-tank support became the main goal, the aircraft was continually up-gunned, eventually mounting a 75&nbsp;mm gun in the anti-tank role that left the plane barely flyable. Only a small number of these B-3 models were produced, late in the war.\n\n==Design and development==\nBy the mid-1930s, the German military, as well as its counterparts in other countries, had come to see the main role of ground-attack aircraft as the [[interdiction]] of logistics and [[materiel]], a task in which targets were often poorly protected and less likely to be defended by strong, well-coordinated defences. For high-value, well-protected tactical targets, the [[dive bomber]] was becoming the conventional solution.\n\nThe experience of the German ''[[Condor Legion|Kondor Legion]]'' during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936&ndash;39) refuted this idea. Even though it was equipped with types unsuited to the role, such as the [[Henschel Hs 123]] and [[Autocannon|cannon]]-armed versions of the [[Heinkel He 112]], the ''Kondor Legion'' proved that ground-attack aircraft were a very effective weapon. This led to support within the ''Luftwaffe'' for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role, and the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|''Reichsluftministerium'']] (RLM; \"[[Reich]] Air Ministry\") requested tenders for a specialized ground attack aircraft.\n\nIt was anticipated that the main source of damage to such an aircraft would be [[small arms]] fire from the ground, meaning that the plane had to be well-[[Vehicle armour|armored]] around its [[cockpit]] and engines. Similar protection was also needed in the [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]], in the form of 75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) thick [[Bullet-proof glass|armored glass]]. The aircraft was expected to be attacking in low-level, head-on [[strafing]] runs, so the cockpit had to be located as close as possible to the nose, in order to maximize the visibility of its targets. Another, non-operational, requirement severely hampered the designs: the RLM insisted that the new design be powered by engines that were not being used in existing aircraft, so that the type would not interfere with the production of established types deemed essential to the war effort.\n\nOnly four companies were asked to submit tenders; three submissions followed and only two of these were considered worthy of consideration: One derived from an existing [[Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH|Focke-Wulf]] reconnaissance type, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189]], the other was Henschel's all-new Hs 129.\n\n===Prototypes===\nThe Hs 129 was designed around a single large \"bathtub\" of steel sheeting that made up the entire nose area of the plane, completely enclosing the [[Aviator|pilot]] up to head level. Even the canopy was steel, with only tiny windows on the side to see out of and two angled blocks of glass for the windscreen. In order to improve the armor's ability to deflect bullets, the [[fuselage]] sides were angled in forming a triangular shape, resulting in almost no room to move at shoulder level. There was so little room in the cockpit that the instrument panel ended up under the nose below the windscreen where it was almost invisible; some of the engine instruments were moved outside onto the engine nacelles' inboard-facing surfaces and the gunsight was mounted outside on the nose.\n\nHenschel's plane came in 12 percent overweight with the engines 8 percent underpowered, and understandably, it flew poorly. The [[Aircraft flight control system|controls]] proved to be almost inoperable as speed increased, and in testing, the V2 prototype flew into the ground from a short dive on 5 January 1940<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_henschel_hs_129.html</ref> because the stick forces were too high for the pilot to pull out. The Focke-Wulf  design proved to be no better. Both planes were underpowered with their air-cooled, inverted-V12 [[Argus As 410]] engines, and very difficult to fly.\n\nThe RLM nevertheless felt they should continue with the basic concept. The only real deciding factor between the two designs was that the Henschel was smaller and cheaper. The Focke-Wulf was put on low priority as a backup, and testing continued with the Hs 129 A-0. A series of improvements resulted in the '''Hs 129 A-1''' series, armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s and two 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, along with the ability to carry four 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs under the fuselage centreline.\n\n===Hs 129 B-1===\nEven before the A-1s were delivered, the plane was redesigned with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] [[radial engine]]s, which were captured in some number when [[Battle of France|France fell]] and continued to be produced under German occupation. This engine supplied {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}} for takeoff, compared to the Argus at {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}}. The Gnome-Rhone radials were also made in versions with [[Counter-rotating propellers|opposite rotation for the propeller]], and were installed on the Hs 129 with the port engine rotating clockwise and the starboard rotating counterclockwise, as seen from nose-on, thus eliminating engine [[torque]] problems. The A-1 planes were converted into '''Hs 129 B-0'''s for testing (although it has been claimed that some As were sold to [[Romania]]) and the pilots were reportedly much happier. Their main complaint was the view from the canopy, so a single larger windscreen and a new canopy with much better vision were added, resulting in the production model '''Hs 129 B-1'''.\n\nB-1s started rolling off the lines in December 1941, but they were delivered at a trickle. In preparation for the new plane, I./[[Schlachtgeschwader 1|SchlG 1]] had been formed up in January with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E/Bs]] (fighter-bomber version of Bf 109 E) and [[Henschel Hs 123|Hs 123]]s, and they delivered B-0s and every B-1 that was completed. Still, it was not until April that 12 B-1s were delivered and the 4th ''staffel'' (squadron) became ready for action. They moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (to [[Crimea]]) in the middle of May 1942, and in June they received a new weapon, the 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;in) [[MK 101 cannon]] with armor-piercing ammunition in a centerline [[Gun pod|pod]].\n\n===Hs 129 B-2===\nDeliveries of the new '''Hs 129 B-2''' model began in May 1942, side by side with the B-1 (of which just 50 planes had been delivered at that point). The only difference between the two were changes to the fuel system &ndash; a host of other minor changes could be found almost at random on either model. These changes accumulated in the B-2 production line until they could eventually be told apart at a glance; the main differences being the removal of the mast for the radio antenna, the addition of a [[Radio direction finder|direction-finding]] [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] loop, and shorter exhaust stacks on the engines.\n\nIn the field, the differences seemed to be more pronounced. The ''[[R\u00fcstsatz]]'' field refit kits were renumbered and some were dropped, and in general, the B-2 planes received the upgraded cannon pack using a 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]] instead of the earlier MK 101. These guns both fired the same ammunition, but the 103 did so at almost twice the rate.\n\nBy late 1942 reports were coming in about the ineffectiveness of the MK 101 against newer versions of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-34]] [[tank]]s. One obvious solution would be to use the larger {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[BK 3,7]] (''Bordkanone'' 3,7), recently adapted from the ground-based [[3.7 cm FlaK 43|Flak 18]]. These guns had already been converted into underwing pod-mounted weapons for the [[Junkers Ju 87G]] and found to be an effective weapon, despite the fact that only 12 shells per pod could be accommodated. When mounted on the Hs 129, the empty area behind the cockpit could be used for ammunition storage, which would address the only problem with the Ju 87's mounting: the limited ammunition supply. The B-2/R3 package introduced the [[BK 3,7]] {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} automatic cannon, but relatively few aircraft were converted in favour of the B-3, mounting the BK 7,5.\n\n===Hs 129 B-3===\n[[File:Hs 129B-3.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of the ''Bordkanone'' BK 7,5 75 mm cannon.]]\n\nIt was decided that the {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} semi-automatic [[Rheinmetall]] [[7.5 cm Pak 40|PaK 40]] anti-tank gun, which had already been adapted for use in the [[Junkers Ju 88]]P-1, would be further modified for use in the Hs 129. This resulted in the BK 7,5 (''Bordkanone'' 7,5), which, even though it weighed {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, was lighter than the PaK 40. Fully automatic, it featured a new, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[recoil]]-dampening system and a new, more aerodynamic [[muzzle brake]]. An [[autoloader]] system, with 12 rounds in a rotary magazine, was fitted in the empty space behind the cockpit, within the rear half of the wing root area.

The aircraft saw combat in [[Battle of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nA key requirement of the original specification was that the aircraft be powered by engines that were not in demand for other designs. Prototypes with low-power german [[Argus As 410]] engines of {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}} failed acceptance test, a more powerful replacement was found with the french [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] engine of {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}}. \n\nThe design was relatively effective when it was first introduced, and saw service on the Eastern Front in a variety of front-line roles. As the war continued and anti-tank support became the main goal, the aircraft was continually up-gunned, eventually mounting a 75&nbsp;mm gun in the anti-tank role that left the plane barely flyable. Only a small number of these B-3 models were produced, late in the war.\n\n==Design and development==\nBy the mid-1930s, the German military, as well as its counterparts in other countries, had come to see the main role of ground-attack aircraft as the [[interdiction]] of logistics and [[materiel]], a task in which targets were often poorly protected and less likely to be defended by strong, well-coordinated defences. For high-value, well-protected tactical targets, the [[dive bomber]] was becoming the conventional solution.\n\nThe experience of the German ''[[Condor Legion|Kondor Legion]]'' during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936&ndash;39) refuted this idea. Even though it was equipped with types unsuited to the role, such as the [[Henschel Hs 123]] and [[Autocannon|cannon]]-armed versions of the [[Heinkel He 112]], the ''Kondor Legion'' proved that ground-attack aircraft were a very effective weapon. This led to support within the ''Luftwaffe'' for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role, and the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|''Reichsluftministerium'']] (RLM; \"[[Reich]] Air Ministry\") requested tenders for a specialized ground attack aircraft.\n\nIt was anticipated that the main source of damage to such an aircraft would be [[small arms]] fire from the ground, meaning that the plane had to be well-[[Vehicle armour|armored]] around its [[cockpit]] and engines. Similar protection was also needed in the [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]], in the form of 75&nbsp;mm (2.95&nbsp;in) thick [[Bullet-proof glass|armored glass]]. The aircraft was expected to be attacking in low-level, head-on [[strafing]] runs, so the cockpit had to be located as close as possible to the nose, in order to maximize the visibility of its targets. Another, non-operational, requirement severely hampered the designs: the RLM insisted that the new design be powered by engines that were not being used in existing aircraft, so that the type would not interfere with the production of established types deemed essential to the war effort.\n\nOnly four companies were asked to submit tenders; three submissions followed and only two of these were considered worthy of consideration: One derived from an existing [[Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH|Focke-Wulf]] reconnaissance type, the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189]], the other was Henschel's all-new Hs 129.\n\n===Prototypes===\nThe Hs 129 was designed around a single large \"bathtub\" of steel sheeting that made up the entire nose area of the plane, completely enclosing the [[Aviator|pilot]] up to head level. Even the canopy was steel, with only tiny windows on the side to see out of and two angled blocks of glass for the windscreen. In order to improve the armor's ability to deflect bullets, the [[fuselage]] sides were angled in forming a triangular shape, resulting in almost no room to move at shoulder level. There was so little room in the cockpit that the instrument panel ended up under the nose below the windscreen where it was almost invisible; some of the engine instruments were moved outside onto the engine nacelles' inboard-facing surfaces, as on some models of Messerschmitt's [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] heavy fighter, and the gunsight was mounted outside on the nose.\n\nHenschel's plane came in 12 percent overweight with the engines 8 percent underpowered, and understandably, it flew poorly. The [[Aircraft flight control system|controls]] proved to be almost inoperable as speed increased, and in testing, the V2 prototype flew into the ground from a short dive on 5 January 1940<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_henschel_hs_129.html</ref> because the stick forces were too high for the pilot to pull out. The Focke-Wulf  design proved to be no better. Both planes were underpowered with their air-cooled, inverted-V12 [[Argus As 410]] engines, and very difficult to fly.\n\nThe RLM nevertheless felt they should continue with the basic concept. The only real deciding factor between the two designs was that the Henschel was smaller and cheaper. The Focke-Wulf was put on low priority as a backup, and testing continued with the Hs 129 A-0. A series of improvements resulted in the '''Hs 129 A-1''' series, armed with two 20&nbsp;mm [[MG 151 cannon|MG 151/20 cannon]]s and two 7.92&nbsp;mm (.312&nbsp;in) [[MG 17 machine gun]]s, along with the ability to carry four 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) bombs under the fuselage centreline.\n\n===Hs 129 B-1===\nEven before the A-1s were delivered, the plane was redesigned with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne 14M]] [[radial engine]]s, which were captured in some number when [[Battle of France|France fell]] and continued to be produced under German occupation. This engine supplied {{cvt|700|PS|hp kW|0}} for takeoff, compared to the Argus at {{cvt|465|PS|hp kW|0}}. The Gnome-Rhone radials were also made in versions with [[Counter-rotating propellers|opposite rotation for the propeller]], and were installed on the Hs 129 with the port engine rotating clockwise and the starboard rotating counterclockwise, as seen from nose-on, thus eliminating engine [[torque]] problems. The A-1 planes were converted into '''Hs 129 B-0'''s for testing (although it has been claimed that some As were sold to [[Romania]]) and the pilots were reportedly much happier. Their main complaint was the view from the canopy, so a single larger windscreen and a new canopy with much better vision were added, resulting in the production model '''Hs 129 B-1'''.\n\nB-1s started rolling off the lines in December 1941, but they were delivered at a trickle. In preparation for the new plane, I./[[Schlachtgeschwader 1|SchlG 1]] had been formed up in January with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#Bf 109E \"Emil\"|Bf 109 E/Bs]] (fighter-bomber version of Bf 109 E) and [[Henschel Hs 123|Hs 123]]s, and they delivered B-0s and every B-1 that was completed. Still, it was not until April that 12 B-1s were delivered and the 4th ''staffel'' (squadron) became ready for action. They moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (to [[Crimea]]) in the middle of May 1942, and in June they received a new weapon, the 30&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;in) [[MK 101 cannon]] with armor-piercing ammunition in a centerline [[Gun pod|pod]].\n\n===Hs 129 B-2===\nDeliveries of the new '''Hs 129 B-2''' model began in May 1942, side by side with the B-1 (of which just 50 planes had been delivered at that point). The only difference between the two were changes to the fuel system &ndash; a host of other minor changes could be found almost at random on either model. These changes accumulated in the B-2 production line until they could eventually be told apart at a glance; the main differences being the removal of the mast for the radio antenna, the addition of a [[Radio direction finder|direction-finding]] [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] loop, and shorter exhaust stacks on the engines.\n\nIn the field, the differences seemed to be more pronounced. The ''[[R\u00fcstsatz]]'' field refit kits were renumbered and some were dropped, and in general, the B-2 planes received the upgraded cannon pack using a 30&nbsp;mm [[MK 103 cannon]] instead of the earlier MK 101. These guns both fired the same ammunition, but the 103 did so at almost twice the rate.\n\nBy late 1942 reports were coming in about the ineffectiveness of the MK 101 against newer versions of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[T-34]] [[tank]]s. One obvious solution would be to use the larger {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} [[BK 3,7]] (''Bordkanone'' 3,7), recently adapted from the ground-based [[3.7 cm FlaK 43|Flak 18]]. These guns had already been converted into underwing pod-mounted weapons for the [[Junkers Ju 87G]] and found to be an effective weapon, despite the fact that only 12 shells per pod could be accommodated. When mounted on the Hs 129, the empty area behind the cockpit could be used for ammunition storage, which would address the only problem with the Ju 87's mounting: the limited ammunition supply. The B-2/R3 package introduced the [[BK 3,7]] {{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} automatic cannon, but relatively few aircraft were converted in favour of the B-3, mounting the BK 7,5.\n\n===Hs 129 B-3===\n[[File:Hs 129B-3.jpg|thumb|right|A closeup of the ''Bordkanone'' BK 7,5 75 mm cannon.]]\n\nIt was decided that the {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on|2}} semi-automatic [[Rheinmetall]] [[7.5 cm Pak 40|PaK 40]] anti-tank gun, which had already been adapted for use in the [[Junkers Ju 88]]P-1, would be further modified for use in the Hs 129. This resulted in the BK 7,5 (''Bordkanone'' 7,5), which, even though it weighed {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, was lighter than the PaK 40. Fully automatic, it featured a new, [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[recoil]]-dampening system and a new, more aerodynamic [[muzzle brake]]. An [[autoloader]] system, with 12 rounds in a rotary magazine, was fitted in the empty space behind the cockpit, within the rear half of the wing root area. The gun and its recoil mechanism occupied a substantial [[gun pod]] under the fuselage, and a circular port at the rear of the pod allowed rearwards ejection of spent cartridges immediately after firing. While this new variant, the '''Hs 129 B-3''', was theoretically capable of destroying any tank in the world, the added weight worsened the aircraft's general performance and it was inferior to previous variants.<ref>[http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html DeutscheLuftwaffe.de's German language page for the BK 7,5 autocannon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517081256/http://www.deutscheluftwaffe.de/archiv/Dokumente/ABC/b/Bordwaffen/Bordkanonen/BordkanoneBK75/bordkanone75.html |date=2016-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Bordkanone'' 7,5 was the heaviest and most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production [[military aircraft]] during World War II.
