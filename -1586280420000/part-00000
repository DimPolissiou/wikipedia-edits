More precisely, for being kept, a symbol must be either a standard or widely used in some area(s) of mathematics. For each symbol that is kept, the status must be clear (standard in all mathematics, standard in a specific part of mathematics, possibly ambiguous if used without care, etc.) and references to standard textbooks must be given for verifiability.|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Math.svg|thumb|Some symbols used widely in mathematics.]]\nThis is a '''list of mathematical symbols''' used in all branches of [[mathematics]] to express a formula or to represent a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]].\n\nA mathematical concept is dependent of the symbol chosen to represent it. For many of the symbols below, the symbol is usually synonymous with the corresponding concept (ultimately an arbitrary choice made as a result of the cumulative history of mathematics), but in some situations, a different convention may be used. For example, depending on context, the [[triple bar]] \"{{math|\u2261}}\" may represent congruence or a definition. However, in [[mathematical logic]], numerical equality is sometimes represented by \"{{math|\u2261}}\" instead of \"{{math|{{=}}}}\", with the latter representing equality of [[well-formed formula]]s. In short, convention does not dictate the meaning.\n\nEach symbol is shown both in [[HTML]], whose display depends on the browser's access to an appropriate font installed on the particular device, and typeset as an image using [[TeX]].\n\n==Guide==\nThis list is organized by symbol type and is intended to facilitate finding an unfamiliar symbol by its visual appearance. For a related list organized by mathematical topic, see [[List of mathematical symbols by subject]]. That list also includes LaTeX and HTML markup, and Unicode code points for each symbol (note that this article doesn't have the latter two, but they could certainly be added).\n\nThere is a Wikibooks guide for using maths in LaTeX,<ref>{{cite web|title=LaTeX/Mathematics|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics|website=Wikibooks|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> and a comprehensive LaTeX symbol list.<ref name=\"LaTeX_Symbols\" /> It is also possible to check to see if a Unicode code point is available as a LaTeX command, or vice versa.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=John|title=Unicode / LaTeX conversion|url=https://www.johndcook.com/unicode_latex.html|website=John Cook Consulting|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> Also note that where there is no LaTeX command natively available for a particular symbol (although there may be options that require adding packages), the symbol could be added via other options, such as setting the document up to support Unicode,<ref>{{cite web|title=LaTeX/Special Characters|url=https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters|website=Wikibooks|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> and entering the character in a variety of ways (e.g. copying and pasting, keyboard shortcuts, the <code>\\unicode{<insertcodepoint>}</code> command<ref>{{cite web|\ntitle=\\unicode - Tex Command| url=https://tutorialsbay.org/tex_commands/unicode.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034818/https://tutorialsbay.org/tex_commands/unicode.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=1 December 2017|\nwebsite=TutorialsBay|\naccessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref>) as well as other options<ref>{{cite web|title=Unicode characters in pdflatex output using hexcode without UTF-8 input|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/89796/unicode-characters-in-pdflatex-output-using-hexcode-without-utf-8-input|website=Tex Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> and extensive additional information.<ref>{{cite web|title=fontenc vs inputenc|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44694/fontenc-vs-inputenc#44699|website=TeX Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=pdflatex crashes when Latex code includes \\unicode{f818} and \\unicode{f817} and how to handle it|url=https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/192626/pdflatex-crashes-when-latex-code-includes-unicodef818-and-unicodef817-and|website=TeX Stack Exchange|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref>.\n* '''Basic symbols:''' Symbols widely used in mathematics.

For many of the symbols below, the symbol is usually synonymous with the corresponding concept (ultimately an arbitrary choice made as a result of the cumulative history of mathematics), but in some situations, a different convention may be used. For example, depending on context, the [[triple bar]] \"{{math|\u2261}}\" may represent congruence or a definition. However, in [[mathematical logic]], numerical equality is sometimes represented by \"{{math|\u2261}}\" instead of \"{{math|{{=}}}}\", with the latter representing equality of [[well-formed formula]]s. In short, convention dictates the meaning.\n\nEach symbol is shown both in [[HTML]], whose display depends on the browser's access to an appropriate font installed on the particular device, and typeset as an image using [[TeX]].\n\n==Guide==\nThis list is organized by symbol type and is intended to facilitate finding an unfamiliar symbol by its visual appearance.

It is filled to a depth of about {{convert|900|ft|m}} with water that is heavily [[acidic]] (2.5 [[pH level]]), about the acidity of Coca-Cola or lemon juice.<ref name=dobb>Edwin Dobb. \"New Life in a Death Trap\".

When the pit was closed, the water pumps in the nearby Kelley Mine, {{cvt|3800|ft}} below the surface, were turned off, and [[groundwater]] from the surrounding aquifers began to slowly fill the Berkeley Pit, rising at about the rate of {{cvt|1|ft|mm}} a month.<ref name=dobb/> Since its closure in 1982, the water level in the pit has risen to within {{cvt|150|ft}} of the natural [[water table]].\n\nThe pit and its water present a serious environmental problem because the water, with dissolved oxygen, allows [[pyrite]] and sulfide minerals in the ore and wall rocks to decay, releasing [[acid mine drainage|acid]]. When the [[pit water]] level eventually reaches the natural water table, estimated to occur around 2020, the pit water will reverse flow back into surrounding groundwater, polluting [[Silver Bow Creek]], which is the headwaters of [[Clark Fork River|Clark Fork of the Columbia River]].<ref name=dobb/> The acidic water in the pit carries a heavy load of dissolved heavy metals. The pit's water contains so much metal that at one point one of its owners, [[Montana Resources LLP|Montana Resources]], mined copper directly from the water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitwatch.org/montana-resources-mines-the-water/|title=Montana Resources mines the water|publisher=PitWatch.org|accessdate=November 18, 2018|date=July 5, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe first plans for solving the groundwater problem were devised in the 1990s. Water flowing into the pit has been diverted by the Horseshoe Bend Water Treatment Plant to slow the rise of the water level.

When [[open pit]] mining operations began in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mine shaft, the older mine gave its name to the pit. The open-pit style of mining superseded underground operations because it was far more economical and much less dangerous than underground mining.\n\nWithin the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material were mined from the Berkeley Pit. Copper was the principal metal produced, although other metals were also extracted, including [[silver]] and [[gold]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Berkeley Pit History\n|url=http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/Phytoremediation/2003/Boczon/Berkeley_Pit_History.html\n|publisher=Colorado State University, Department of Biology\n|accessdate=2009-02-21\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428152420/http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/Phytoremediation/2003/Boczon/Berkeley_Pit_History.html\n|archivedate=2009-04-28\n}}</ref>\n\nTwo communities and much of Butte's previously crowded east side were consumed by land purchases to expand the pit.{{When|date=November 2018}} The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businesses and schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, and McQueen, east of the pit site.Many of these homes were either destroyed, buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte.

When [[open pit]] mining operations began in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mine shaft, the older mine gave its name to the pit. The open-pit style of mining superseded underground operations because it was far more economical and much less dangerous than underground mining.\n\nWithin the first year of operation, the pit extracted 17,000 tons of ore per day at a grade of 0.75% copper. Ultimately, about 1,000,000,000 tons of material were mined from the Berkeley Pit. Copper was the principal metal produced, although other metals were also extracted, including [[silver]] and [[gold]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Berkeley Pit History\n|url=http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/Phytoremediation/2003/Boczon/Berkeley_Pit_History.html\n|publisher=Colorado State University, Department of Biology\n|accessdate=2009-02-21\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428152420/http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/Phytoremediation/2003/Boczon/Berkeley_Pit_History.html\n|archivedate=2009-04-28\n}}</ref>\n\nTwo communities and much of Butte's previously crowded east side were consumed by land purchases to expand the pit.{{When|date=November 2018}} The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businesses and schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, and McQueen, east of the pit site.Many of these homes were either destroyed, buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte.
