Jones had met Cochrane through his wife Jane, as they both worked for the same company.<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/> The group performed their rituals either at Cochrane's house, or, more often, at [[Burnham Beeches]], though they also performed rituals at the [[South Downs]], after which they would stay the night at [[Doreen Valiente]]'s flat in [[Brighton]].<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\nIn 1966, Robert Cochrane died.

The Goddess is viewed as the White Goddess, a term taken from [[Robert Graves]]' poem, ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>  She is also viewed as a triad of three mothers or three sisters, which both Cochrane and [[Evan John Jones (Witch)|Evan John Jones]] noted as having similarities with the [[weird sisters]] or [[Norns]] of [[Germanic paganism]].<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\nIn Cochrane's Craft, the God is associated with fire, the underworld and time, and has been described as \"the goat-god of fire, craft, lower magics, fertility and death\". The God was known by several names, most notable [[Tubal-cain|Tubal Cain]], [[Br\u00e2n the Blessed|Br\u00e2n]], [[Wayland Smith|Wayland]] and [[Herne the Hunter|Herne]].<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/> Cochrane's tradition held that these two deities had a son, the Horn Child, who was a young sun god.<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\nCochrane, like Gardner, believed that there was a being beyond the God and the Goddess; the [[Deity|Godhead]], although he referred to this deity as \"the Hidden Goddess\". He also referred to it as \"Truth\".<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\nCochrane told of a [[cosmogony]] myth, which involved Night, \"a feminine being with force, but without form, giving birth to man and with him she discovered love, and so all things began\".<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/> He said that the Elder Gods had seven children who each created a realm to rule over from a castle, as well as creating the elements of earth, air, fire and water, each of which had a god ruling over it.<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\n===Ethics and morality===\nNo mention is made in Cochrane's writings to the Wiccan Rede or \"Threefold Law\".

According to Jones, the shaft of the stang should be made from ash; the fork of the stang should be made of iron; the base should be shod in iron; two upward-facing crossed arrows should adorn the shaft below the fork; and, on the four \"Great Sabbats\" (i.e. Candlemas, May Eve, Lammas, and Halloween), the arrows should be garlanded as fits the season.<ref name=\"Roebuck\"/>\n\n==Media==\nIn 2015 a feature film, ''[[The Coven (film)|The Coven]]'' was released based on the premise that \"Robbie Cochrane founded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s\" and that followers were meeting in [[Queen's Wood]] in [[Highgate]].

Bent Flyvbjerg was [[knight]]ed in the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] in 2002.\n\nHis research falls in three main areas: (a) The philosophy and methodology of the social sciences, (b) Power and rationality in decision making, and (c) Megaproject planning and management.\n\nIn the philosophy and methodology of the social sciences, Flyvbjerg's main contribution is developing the theory and methodology of phronetic social science, i.e., a social science based on [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian]] [[phronesis]]. Flyvbjerg argues that social sciences that attempt to emulate [[natural science]] and predictive theory have failed, and will continue to fail. He further argues that in order to matter the social sciences must inform [[practical reason]] instead of abstract [[rationality]]. This is best done by a focus on values and power in actual human decision making, according to Flyvbjerg. He develops the methodological guidelines for such research and demonstrates how to employ them in concrete case studies in phronetic social science. Phronetic research is aimed at being directly relevant to society and people, including ordinary citizens and policy makers. In terms of philosophy and history of science, Flyvbjerg is influenced by Aristotle rather than by Socrates and Plato. Flyvbjerg's key works on phronetic social science are the books ''[[Making Social Science Matter|Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again]]<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2001, ''Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 214 pp.</ref>'' and ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3I2fBeHZpBcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Real+Social+Science:+Applied+Phronesis&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzpvjL4eroAhWOYcAKHcWsAUoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Real%20Social%20Science%3A%20Applied%20Phronesis&f=false Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis]'' (with Sanford Schram and Todd Landman),<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, Todd Landman, and Sanford Schram, 2012 eds., ''Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 319 pp.</ref> both published by [[Cambridge University Press]], plus a number of research papers.<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2004, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278320 Phronetic Planning Research: Theoretical and Methodological Reflections].\" ''Planning Theory and Practice'' , vol. 5, no. 3, September, pp. 283-306.</ref> <ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2002, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278388 Bringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher\u2019s Praxis Story].\" Invited plenary paper for ''Planning Research 2000'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 27-29 March 2000.

Flyvbjerg here shows that in human decision making what is called rationality often turns out to be rationalization, under the influence of power. Flyvbjerg sums up this work in a number of propositions about power and rationality, among which:\n\n* Power defines reality;\n* Rationality is context-dependent; the context of rationality is power;\n* Rationalization presented as rationality is a principal strategy in the exercize of power;\n* The greater the power, the less the rationality;\n* Power has a rationality that rationality does not know.\n\nFlyvbjerg argues that his research on power and rationality is an instance of phronetic social science (see above).<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2001, Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again, translator Steven Sampson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 144 ff.</ref> Theoretically and methodologically, the main influences on Flyvbjerg's work on power and rationality are [[Thucydides]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. Flyvbjerg specifically highlights Machiavelli's power studies in Florence as a source of influence for the choice of in-depth case studies as the means for understanding the dynamics of power and how power enables and constrains rationality and rational government. Flyvbjerg's main works on power and rationality are the book ''[[Rationality and Power|Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice]],''<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 1998, ''Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press). </ref> published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], plus a number of research papers.<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2002, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278388 Bringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher\u2019s Praxis Story].\" Invited plenary paper for ''Planning Research 2000'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 27-29 March 2000.

Flyvbjerg documents what he calls [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2742088 The Iron Law of Megaprojects]: \"Over time, over budget, under benefits, over and over again.\"<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2017, \"Introduction: The Iron Law of Megaproject Management\", in Bent Flyvbjerg, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), pp. 1-18.</ref> This is a statistical, not a deterministic, law. Megaprojects that are on time, budget, and benefits do exist, but they are rare, according to the data. The Iron Law applies at an overwhelmingly high level of statistical significance. Flyvbjerg shows that a root cause is that competition between megaprojects and their sponsors creates biases rooted in political and organizational pressures that lead to the consistent overestimating of project benefits and the underestimating of project costs. The best megaprojects do not get implemented, but rather the ones that look best on paper. Flyvbjerg argues that the ones that look best on paper are the ones for which costs and benefits have been misrepresented the most, either deliberately through strategic misrepresentation (political bias), or non-deliberately through [[optimism bias]] (psychological bias) or, typically, through a combination of both. \n\nFlyvbjerg identifies three antidotes to the Iron Law: (a) Realistic planning, including de-biasing of all cost, schedule, and benefit estimates; (b) High-quality delivery teams; and (c) Governance structures with incentives for realistic plans and for delivering those plans to time, budget, and benefits; and with early-warning-sign systems to immediately capture and act on things that go wrong, which they invariably do in megaprojects, due to their sheer size and complexity, according to Flyvbjerg. Based on [[Daniel Kahneman|Daniel Kahneman's]] work on the [[planning fallacy]] and optimism bias, Flyvbjerg pioneered [[reference class forecasting]] as a practical method for de-biasing megaproject plans. In his book, [[Thinking, Fast and Slow|''Thinking, Fast and Slow'']], Kahneman calls Flyvbjerg's insights on the planning fallacy and reference class forecasting, \"the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting.\"<ref>Kahneman, Daniel, 2011, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), p. 251.</ref> Daniel Kahneman is a key intellectual influence for Flyvbjerg's work on megaprojects, as is [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], especially his work on [[Black swan statistics|black swans]], and [[Martin Wachs]], who was Flyvbjerg's doctoral supervisor at UCLA.

Bent Flyvbjerg was [[knight]]ed in the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] in 2002.\n\nHis research falls in three main areas: (a) The philosophy and methodology of the social sciences, (b) Power and rationality in decision making, and (c) Megaproject planning and management.\n\nIn the philosophy and methodology of the social sciences, Flyvbjerg's main contribution is developing the theory and methodology of phronetic social science, i.e., a social science based on [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian]] [[phronesis]]. Flyvbjerg argues that social sciences that attempt to emulate [[natural science]] and predictive theory have failed, and will continue to fail. He further argues that in order to matter the social sciences must inform [[practical reason]] instead of abstract [[rationality]]. This is best done by a focus on values and power in actual human decision making, according to Flyvbjerg. He develops the methodological guidelines for such research and demonstrates how to employ them in concrete case studies in phronetic social science. Phronetic research is aimed at being directly relevant to society and people, including ordinary citizens and policy makers. In terms of philosophy and history of science, Flyvbjerg is influenced by Aristotle rather than by Socrates and Plato. Flyvbjerg's key works on phronetic social science are the books ''[[Making Social Science Matter|Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again]]<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2001, ''Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 214 pp.</ref>'' and ''[[Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis]]'' (with Sanford Schram and Todd Landman),<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, Todd Landman, and Sanford Schram, 2012 eds., ''Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 319 pp.</ref> both published by [[Cambridge University Press]], plus a number of research papers.<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2004, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278320 Phronetic Planning Research: Theoretical and Methodological Reflections].\" ''Planning Theory and Practice'' , vol. 5, no. 3, September, pp. 283-306.</ref> <ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2002, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278388 Bringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher\u2019s Praxis Story].\" Invited plenary paper for ''Planning Research 2000'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 27-29 March 2000.

Flyvbjerg here shows that in human decision making what is called rationality often turns out to be rationalization, under the influence of power. Flyvbjerg sums up this work in a number of propositions about power and rationality, among which:\n\n* Power defines reality;\n* Rationality is context-dependent; the context of rationality is power;\n* Rationalization presented as rationality is a principal strategy in the exercize of power;\n* The greater the power, the less the rationality;\n* Power has a rationality that rationality does not know.\n\nFlyvbjerg argues that his research on power and rationality is an instance of phronetic social science (see above).<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2001, Making Social Science Matter: Why Social Inquiry Fails and How It Can Succeed Again, translator Steven Sampson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 144 ff.</ref> Theoretically and methodologically, the main influences on Flyvbjerg's work on power and rationality are [[Thucydides]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. Flyvbjerg specifically highlights Machiavelli's power studies in Florence as a source of influence for the choice of in-depth case studies as the means for understanding the dynamics of power and how power enables and constrains rationality and rational government. Flyvbjerg's main works on power and rationality are the book ''[[Rationality and Power|Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice]],''<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 1998, ''Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press). </ref> published by the [[University of Chicago Press]], plus a number of research papers.<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2002, \"[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2278388 Bringing Power to Planning Research: One Researcher\u2019s Praxis Story].\" Invited plenary paper for ''Planning Research 2000'', London School of Economics and Political Science, 27-29 March 2000.

Flyvbjerg documents what he calls [[The Iron Law of Megaprojects]]: \"Over time, over budget, under benefits, over and over again.\"<ref>Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2017, \"Introduction: The Iron Law of Megaproject Management\", in Bent Flyvbjerg, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), pp. 1-18.</ref> This is a statistical, not a deterministic, law. Megaprojects that are on time, budget, and benefits do exist, but they are rare, according to the data. The Iron Law applies at an overwhelmingly high level of statistical significance. Flyvbjerg shows that a root cause is that competition between megaprojects and their sponsors creates biases rooted in political and organizational pressures that lead to the consistent overestimating of project benefits and the underestimating of project costs. The best megaprojects do not get implemented, but rather the ones that look best on paper. Flyvbjerg argues that the ones that look best on paper are the ones for which costs and benefits have been misrepresented the most, either deliberately through strategic misrepresentation (political bias), or non-deliberately through [[optimism bias]] (psychological bias) or, typically, through a combination of both. \n\nFlyvbjerg identifies three antidotes to the Iron Law: (a) Realistic planning, including de-biasing of all cost, schedule, and benefit estimates; (b) High-quality delivery teams; and (c) Governance structures with incentives for realistic plans and for delivering those plans to time, budget, and benefits; and with early-warning-sign systems to immediately capture and act on things that go wrong, which they invariably do in megaprojects, due to their sheer size and complexity, according to Flyvbjerg. Based on [[Daniel Kahneman|Daniel Kahneman's]] work on the [[planning fallacy]] and optimism bias, Flyvbjerg pioneered [[reference class forecasting]] as a practical method for de-biasing megaproject plans. In his book, [[Thinking, Fast and Slow|''Thinking, Fast and Slow'']], Kahneman calls Flyvbjerg's insights on the planning fallacy and reference class forecasting, \"the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting.\"<ref>Kahneman, Daniel, 2011, ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux), p. 251.</ref> Daniel Kahneman is a key intellectual influence for Flyvbjerg's work on megaprojects, as is [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], especially his work on [[Black swan statistics|black swans]], and [[Martin Wachs]], who was Flyvbjerg's doctoral supervisor at UCLA.

Founded in 1767 by [[Samuel Bard (physician)|Samuel Bard]] as the medical department of King's College (now [[Columbia University]]), VP&S was the first [[medical school]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to award the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree. Beginning in 1993, VP&S was also the first U.S. medical school to hold a [[white coat ceremony]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/md-program/md-student-resources/office-student-affairs/white-coat|title=White Coat Ceremony '10 &#124; Columbia University Medical Center|publisher=Cumc.columbia.edu|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', VP&S is one of the most selective medical schools in the United States based on average [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] score, [[Grade point average|GPA]], and acceptance rate.<ref>https://www.ps.columbia.edu/about-us/facts-and-statistics</ref> In 2018, 7,537 people applied and 1,007 were interviewed for 140 seats in its entering MD class.<ref>url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/about-us/facts-and-statistics</ref> The median undergraduate GPA and average MCAT score for successful applicants in 2014 were 3.82 and 36, respectively.

The scholarships are funded by an endowment that was established by Dr. [[P. Roy Vagelos]] and his wife Diana Vagelos; in December 2017, the 250-year-old medical school was renamed in their honor. The Vageloses committed more than $310 million to Columbia, $150 million of which was directed toward the scholarship fund.<ref>https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/columbia-launches-scholarship-program-eliminate-medical-school-loans-students-financial-need</ref>\n\nColumbia is affiliated with [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]], the nation's 5th-ranked hospital according to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>[https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ny/new-york-presbyterian-university-hospital-of-columbia-and-cornell-6210024 \"New York-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia and Cornell\"] ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' (September 2, 2019)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2019-20 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings|url=https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Curriculum==\nBeginning in the fall of 2009, the medical school implemented a new curriculum that differed markedly from more traditional structures. The largest change involved a reduction in the number of preclinical months from twenty-four to eighteen and the expansion of the electives and selectives period to fourteen months. Each student now is required to spend four to ten months working on a scholarly project before graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/md-program/curriculum/md-curriculum/differentiation-and-integration-d-7|title=The Columbia Curriculum}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:ColumbiaMedicalCenter.jpeg|thumb|400px|Aerial view of the Columbia University Medical Center]]\n\n===Campus===\nSituated on land overlooking the [[Hudson River]] and separated from Columbia's undergraduate campus in [[Morningside Heights]] by approximately fifty blocks and the neighborhood of [[Harlem]], the [[Columbia University Medical Center]] has its own unique standing and identity. The campus comprises not only VP&S, but also the College of Dental Medicine (formerly the School of Dental and Oral Surgery), the School of Nursing, the Mailman School of Public Health, the Presbyterian portion of [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] (including the [[Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital]]) and the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]]. Affiliated hospitals include [[Harlem Hospital Center|Harlem Hospital]], [[Stamford Hospital]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut, and [[Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. In August 2016 the [https://www.cumc.columbia.edu/facilities-management/capital-projects/our-projects/roy-and-diana-vagelos-education-center Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center], new 100,000-square-foot, 14-story glass medical education tower opened at 104 Haven Avenue, between 171st and 172nd Streets, near the northern tip of the campus. Housing options on Columbia's Medical Campus include Bard Hall and the Bard-Haven Towers, a complex of three, 31-story apartment buildings overlooking the [[Hudson River]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Students are guaranteed housing on campus all years, although many students choose to live in other parts of New York City.\n\n===P&S Club===\nThere are student clubs covering a range of professional and personal interests, all of which fall under the umbrella of the P&S Club. One unusual element is the Bard Hall Players, a theatrical group entirely run by the students of the medical campus, and one of the largest and most active medical school theater groups in the country. They perform a musical and two plays each year. Founded over a century ago by [[John Mott]], the 1946 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, the P&S Club serves to support and provide activities and organizations for the enrichment of the lives of VP&S students. The P&S Club is well known for its humanitarian aims; most notably the 1917 purchase of a steam launch delivered to Sir William Grenfell, a physician living in [[Labrador]]. This launch was used to deliver medical services to the [[Inuit]] and [[First Nations]] fishermen living on the islands of the Labrador coast and frequently, was manned by P&S students.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Colonial years===\nIn 1767, Dr. [[Samuel Bard (physician)|Samuel Bard]], an alumnus of then-[[Columbia University|King's College]] and the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], opened a [[medical school]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. At the time, the medical program at King's College was the first to open in the [[Province of New York]] and only the second to be opened in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]]. The school was modelled on the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], which at the time was the world leader. Three years later, in 1770, King's College conferred its first [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] to Robert Tucker, this would prove to be the first [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) awarded in the Thirteen Colonies. Prior to King's College of Medicine offering of the M.D. degree, other American and Canadian medical schools had been offering the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B.]] degree. King's College continued to educate young doctors until 1776 when the school was forced to close due to the onset of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and the [[New York Campaign|occupation of New York]] by British soldiers. King's College remained closed until 1784 when the school was reopened as Columbia College and in December of that year, the faculty of the medical school were re-instated. In 1791, Bard, now a prominent colonial physician whom [[George Washington]] credited with saving his life, was named dean of the medical school.\n\n[[File:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons entrance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original entrance to the College]]\n[[File:Bard Hall Columbia jeh.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Bard Hall]]\n\n===Merger with the College of Physicians and Surgeons===\nIn 1807, with a growing young nation in need of adequately trained physicians, the [[New York State Board of Regents]] founded, under separate charter, the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Merely four years later, in 1811, Dr. Samuel Bard, dean of Columbia University Medical School, became president of the College. The year 1814 then saw the merger of Columbia University Medical School into the College of Physicians and Surgeons, a move that was made in an attempt to reverse what then was perceived as a period of decline for the medical school. \n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg280 COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS, 437 WEST 59TH STREET.jpg|left|thumb|437 West 59th Street in 1893]]\nDespite this merger, the College of Physicians and Surgeons retained its independence from Columbia and it was only in 1860 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons, at that time occupying buildings across West Fifty-ninth Street from the [[Mount Sinai West|Roosevelt Hospital]] (its major teaching hospital at the time), after severing its ties to the New York Board of Regents and through agreement between the trustees of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia, became the official medical school of Columbia University. This new relationship between the college and Columbia was minimal at best, however, with the college retaining independence from Columbia. It was not until 1891 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons would be fully integrated and incorporated into Columbia. In 1886, the Sloane Maternity Hospital, later the [[Sloane Hospital for Women]], was founded as part of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n===Medical Center Formation===\nIn 1911, Columbia University entered into a \"Formal Agreement of Alliance\" with Presbyterian Hospital, a hospital founded in 1868 by [[James Lenox]] a New York [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. It was this alliance, initiated by philanthropist [[Edward Harkness]], that helped to pave the way for the creation of a new medical center format. In 1928, the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened its doors in building largely funded by Harkness. Set on land in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of Manhattan, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center was the first place in the world to provide facilities for patient care, medical education, and research all under one roof. It was the first academic [[Academic health science centre|medical center]] and pioneered the practice of combining medical training with patient care. Included in this project with Presbyterian Hospital were the Babies Hospital, the Neurologic Institute of New York, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute; these were then joined in 1950 by the [[New York Orthopaedic Hospital]].\n\nIn 1997, the Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital (partner of [[Weill Cornell Medicine]] of [[Cornell University]]) to form the [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]]. This new hospital system also has incorporated many of the satellite hospitals and affiliated programs of these two institutions. While the two medical schools remain independent of one another, there has been significant cross-fertilization between the two campuses, leading to increasing numbers of shared research experiences and training programs. NYPH is now the largest private employer in New York City. All hospitals in the [[NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System]] are affiliated with either the Cornell or Columbia medical schools.\n\n===Renaming===\nAt the 2017 Crown Awards, President [[Lee Bollinger]] announced that the school would officially be renamed as the Columbia University Roy and Diana Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. This decision was made in response to a gift of $250 million from Dr. P. Roy and Diana [[P. Roy Vagelos|Vagelos]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=With $250 Million Gift, Columbia Medical School Looks to End Student Debt|author=Otterman, Sharon|date=December 4, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|p=A21}}</ref> $150 million of the gift, was dedicated to endow a fund to help Columbia eliminate student loans for medical students who qualify for financial aid.<ref name=\":0\"/> The remaining $100 million will be divided equally to support precision medicine programs and basic science research as well as an endowed professorship in the Department of Medicine in honor of the Vagelos family's longtime doctor and friend, Thomas P.

Founded in 1767 by [[Samuel Bard (physician)|Samuel Bard]] as the medical department of King's College (now [[Columbia University]]), VP&S was the first [[medical school]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to award the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) degree. Beginning in 1993, VP&S was also the first U.S. medical school to hold a [[white coat ceremony]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/md-program/md-student-resources/office-student-affairs/white-coat|title=White Coat Ceremony '10 &#124; Columbia University Medical Center|publisher=Cumc.columbia.edu|date=September 13, 2010|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', VP&S is one of the most selective medical schools in the United States based on average [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] score, [[Grade point average|GPA]], and acceptance rate.<ref>https://www.ps.columbia.edu/about-us/facts-and-statistics</ref> In 2018, 7,537 people applied and 1,007 were interviewed for 140 seats in its entering MD class.<ref>url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/about-us/facts-and-statistics</ref> The median undergraduate GPA and average MCAT score for successful applicants in 2014 were 3.82 and 36, respectively.

The scholarships are funded by an endowment that was established by Dr. [[P. Roy Vagelos]] and his wife Diana Vagelos; in December 2017, the 250-year-old medical school was renamed in their honor. The Vageloses committed more than $310 million to Columbia, $150 million of which was directed toward the scholarship fund.<ref>https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/columbia-launches-scholarship-program-eliminate-medical-school-loans-students-financial-need</ref>\n\nColumbia is affiliated with [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]], the nation's 5th-ranked hospital according to ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''.<ref>[https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ny/new-york-presbyterian-university-hospital-of-columbia-and-cornell-6210024 \"New York-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia and Cornell\"] ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' (September 2, 2019)</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2019-20 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings|url=https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Curriculum==\nBeginning in the fall of 2009, the medical school implemented a new curriculum that differed markedly from more traditional structures. The largest change involved a reduction in the number of preclinical months from twenty-four to eighteen and the expansion of the electives and selectives period to fourteen months. Each student now is required to spend four to ten months working on a scholarly project before graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ps.columbia.edu/education/academic-programs/md-program/curriculum/md-curriculum/differentiation-and-integration-d-7|title=The Columbia Curriculum}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:ColumbiaMedicalCenter.jpeg|thumb|400px|Aerial view of the Columbia University Medical Center]]\n\n===Campus===\nSituated on land overlooking the [[Hudson River]] and separated from Columbia's undergraduate campus in [[Morningside Heights]] by approximately fifty blocks and the neighborhood of [[Harlem]], the [[Columbia University Medical Center]] has its own unique standing and identity. The campus comprises not only VP&S, but also the College of Dental Medicine (formerly the School of Dental and Oral Surgery), the School of Nursing, the Mailman School of Public Health, the Presbyterian portion of [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]] (including the [[Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital]]) and the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]]. Affiliated hospitals include [[Harlem Hospital Center|Harlem Hospital]], [[Stamford Hospital]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], Connecticut, and [[Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. In August 2016 the [https://www.cumc.columbia.edu/facilities-management/capital-projects/our-projects/roy-and-diana-vagelos-education-center Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center], new 100,000-square-foot, 14-story glass medical education tower opened at 104 Haven Avenue, between 171st and 172nd Streets, near the northern tip of the campus. Housing options on Columbia's Medical Campus include Bard Hall and the Bard-Haven Towers, a complex of three, 31-story apartment buildings overlooking the [[Hudson River]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Students are guaranteed housing on campus all years, although many students choose to live in other parts of New York City.\n\n===P&S Club===\nThere are student clubs covering a range of professional and personal interests, all of which fall under the umbrella of the P&S Club. One unusual element is the Bard Hall Players, a theatrical group entirely run by the students of the medical campus, and one of the largest and most active medical school theater groups in the country. They perform a musical and two plays each year. Founded over a century ago by [[John Mott]], the 1946 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, the P&S Club serves to support and provide activities and organizations for the enrichment of the lives of VP&S students. The P&S Club is well known for its humanitarian aims; most notably the 1917 purchase of a steam launch delivered to Sir William Grenfell, a physician living in [[Labrador]]. This launch was used to deliver medical services to the [[Inuit]] and [[First Nations]] fishermen living on the islands of the Labrador coast and frequently, was manned by P&S students.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Colonial years===\nIn 1767, Dr. [[Samuel Bard (physician)|Samuel Bard]], an alumnus of King's College (now [[Columbia University]]) and the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], opened a [[medical school]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]. At the time, the medical program at King's College was the first to open in the [[Province of New York]] and only the second to be opened in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]]. The school was modelled on the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]], which at the time was the world leader. Three years later, in 1770, King's College conferred its first [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] to Robert Tucker, this would prove to be the first [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) awarded in the Thirteen Colonies. Prior to King's College of Medicine offering of the M.D. degree, other American and Canadian medical schools had been offering the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B.]] degree. King's College continued to educate young doctors until 1776 when the school was forced to close due to the onset of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and the [[New York Campaign|occupation of New York]] by British soldiers. King's College remained closed until 1784 when the school was reopened as Columbia College and in December of that year, the faculty of the medical school were re-instated. In 1791, Bard, now a prominent colonial physician whom [[George Washington]] credited with saving his life, was named dean of the medical school.\n\n[[File:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons entrance.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original entrance to the College]]\n[[File:Bard Hall Columbia jeh.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Bard Hall]]\n\n===Merger with the College of Physicians and Surgeons===\nIn 1807, with a growing young nation in need of adequately trained physicians, the [[New York State Board of Regents]] founded, under separate charter, the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Merely four years later, in 1811, Dr. Samuel Bard, dean of Columbia University Medical School, became president of the College. The year 1814 then saw the merger of Columbia University Medical School into the College of Physicians and Surgeons, a move that was made in an attempt to reverse what then was perceived as a period of decline for the medical school. \n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg280 COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS, 437 WEST 59TH STREET.jpg|left|thumb|437 West 59th Street in 1893]]\nDespite this merger, the College of Physicians and Surgeons retained its independence from Columbia and it was only in 1860 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons, at that time occupying buildings across West Fifty-ninth Street from the [[Mount Sinai West|Roosevelt Hospital]] (its major teaching hospital at the time), after severing its ties to the New York Board of Regents and through agreement between the trustees of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia, became the official medical school of Columbia University. This new relationship between the college and Columbia was minimal at best, however, with the college retaining independence from Columbia. It was not until 1891 that the College of Physicians and Surgeons would be fully integrated and incorporated into Columbia. In 1886, the Sloane Maternity Hospital, later the [[Sloane Hospital for Women]], was founded as part of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n===Medical Center Formation===\nIn 1911, Columbia University entered into a \"Formal Agreement of Alliance\" with Presbyterian Hospital, a hospital founded in 1868 by [[James Lenox]] a New York [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. It was this alliance, initiated by philanthropist [[Edward Harkness]], that helped to pave the way for the creation of a new medical center format. In 1928, the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center opened its doors in building largely funded by Harkness. Set on land in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of Manhattan, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center was the first place in the world to provide facilities for patient care, medical education, and research all under one roof. It was the first academic [[Academic health science centre|medical center]] and pioneered the practice of combining medical training with patient care. Included in this project with Presbyterian Hospital were the Babies Hospital, the Neurologic Institute of New York, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute; these were then joined in 1950 by the [[New York Orthopaedic Hospital]].\n\nIn 1997, the Presbyterian Hospital merged with New York Hospital (partner of [[Weill Cornell Medicine]] of [[Cornell University]]) to form the [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]]. This new hospital system also has incorporated many of the satellite hospitals and affiliated programs of these two institutions. While the two medical schools remain independent of one another, there has been significant cross-fertilization between the two campuses, leading to increasing numbers of shared research experiences and training programs. NYPH is now the largest private employer in New York City. All hospitals in the [[NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System]] are affiliated with either the Cornell or Columbia medical schools.\n\n===Renaming===\nAt the 2017 Crown Awards, President [[Lee Bollinger]] announced that the school would officially be renamed as the Columbia University Roy and Diana Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. This decision was made in response to a gift of $250 million from Dr. P. Roy and Diana [[P. Roy Vagelos|Vagelos]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|title=With $250 Million Gift, Columbia Medical School Looks to End Student Debt|author=Otterman, Sharon|date=December 4, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|p=A21}}</ref> $150 million of the gift, was dedicated to endow a fund to help Columbia eliminate student loans for medical students who qualify for financial aid.<ref name=\":0\"/> The remaining $100 million will be divided equally to support precision medicine programs and basic science research as well as an endowed professorship in the Department of Medicine in honor of the Vagelos family's longtime doctor and friend, Thomas P.

Many of the tribes that surrounded the land were skilled with horses and trading with one another; some tribes were known for their [[horse breeding]] which resulted in today's [[Appaloosa]] or [[Cayuse horse]].\n\nThe word ''Sahaptin/Shahaptin'' is not the one used by the tribes that speak it, but from the Columbia Salish name, '''S\u0127\u00e1pt\u0259n\u0259xw / S-h\u00e1ptinoxw''', which means \"stranger in the land\".

Early white explorers mistakenly applied the name to all the various Sahaptin speaking people, as well as to the Nez Perce. Sahaptin is spoken by various tribes of the Washington Reservations; Yakama, Warm Springs, Umatilla; and also spoken in many smaller communities, including one in Oregon, Celilo.\n\nThe [[Yakama]] tribal cultural resources program has been promoting the use of the traditional name of the language, ''Ichishk\u00edin S\u0268\u0301nwit'' (\u2033this language\u2033), instead of the Salish term ''Sahaptin''.<ref>Beavert, Virginia and Hargus, Sharon ''Ichishk\u00edin s\u0268\u0301nwit yakama = Yakima Sahaptin dictionary''.

Upon his return he became president of newly formed Local 174 on Detroit's west side and with brother Victor, led the first successful strike against the automotive giants at Kelsey Hayes, which supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford Motor Company. The main complaint was the speed-up of the assembly line was intolerable. Workers were losing limbs and even their own lives trying in vain to keep up with the ever-increasing speed of the assembly line. It was December 1936 when the workers pulled a surprise strike and sat down in the plant refusing to leave until management negotiated with their representative, Walter Reuther.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reuther|last=Frank.|first=Cormier|date=1970|publisher=Prentice-Hall|others=Eaton, William J.|isbn=9780137793143|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/reuther00corm/page/70 70\u201373]|oclc=91809|url=https://archive.org/details/reuther00corm/page/70}}</ref>\n\nWhen management tried to enter the plant to remove the machinery, thousands of sympathizers swarmed the sidewalks and blocked the doorways. Ford needed those brake drums and wheels badly and after 10 days of striking the sides settled. The first major UAW victory to unionize the auto factories was won. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work: 75 cents an hour. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior|last=Reuther.|first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth|date=2004|publisher=LivingForce Pub|isbn=9780975379219|location=Lake Orion, Mich.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/39 39\u201341]|oclc=57172289|url=https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/39}}</ref>\n\n=== General Motors ===\nIn 1936, [[General Motors]] (GM) was the largest corporation in the world and held many plants in [[Flint, Michigan]], about 60 miles north of Detroit. Reuther's brother, Roy, was already in Flint drawing up strategy plans and organizing workers to shut down the automaker until it would recognize the rights of the workers to unionize. The strike began on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1936 when the workers sat down in the plants and refused to leave. General Motors retaliated by turning off the heat in the plant.\n\nIn solidarity with the Flint strikers, Reuther led a strike at Detroit's Fleetwood Plant, where bodies were made for GM's luxury vehicle, the Cadillac. Support strikes were also called in Oakland, California, Pontiac, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri. Autoworkers around the nation engaged in action in support of the Flint sit-down strikers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The brothers Reuther and the story of the UAW : a memoir|last=Reuther |first= Victor G.|date=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395275153|edition=  UAW special |location=Boston|pages=150|oclc=26295254}}</ref>\n\nBack in Flint, the police tried to force the workers out of the plant in what became known as the \"Battle of Bulls Run.\" Over a hundred policemen attacked the pickets with tear gas and bullets, sending thirteen workers to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Victor manned the sound car and encouraged the workers to fight back, which they did by sling-shotting door hinges from the factory roof and turning fire hoses on the police in the 16-degree Fahrenheit winter night. Victor and Genora Johnson, a leader of the Women's Brigade, took turns in the sound car exhorting the workers to stand their ground.\n\nMichigan Governor, [[Frank Murphy]], called in 2,000 members of the National Guard, not to force the workers out of the plants, but to keep the peace. After a brilliant move, the workers were able to gain control of the only plant in the country that made [[Chevrolet]] engines. Finally, 44 days later, General Motors was forced to recognize the worker's right to unionize and signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the fledgling UAW.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The brothers Reuther and the story of the UAW : a memoir|last=Reuther |first= Victor G.|date=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395275153|edition=  UAW special |location=Boston|oclc=26295254}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Flint sit-down strike|Flint Sit-Down Strike]] has become known as the Lexington and Valley Forge of American industrial unionism. Roy recalled, \"When the boys came out of the plants, I never saw a night like that and perhaps will never see it again. I liken it to a country experiencing independence, families reunited for the first time since the strike began, kids hanging onto daddy with tears of joy and happiness.

His main enforcer was [[Harry Bennett]], who led a 3,000 man Security Department for Ford Motor Company, whose mandate was to intimidate, beat, and fire any worker who showed signs of favoring unionization. In 1932, when workers marched out of the giant [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] in protest to the speed-up of the assembly lines, they were attacked by Bennett's armed men and 5 workers were shot dead and hundreds suffered injuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=LIFE AND TIMES OF WALTER REUTHER.|last=JAMES.|first=TENEYCK|date=2016|publisher=PAGE PUBLISHING, INC|isbn=9781683482086|location=[S.l.]|pages=212|oclc=975986306}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Labor-Strike-Ford Motor Company-Walter Reuther fifth from the left-Richard Frankensteen sixth from the left - NARA - 195593.tif|thumb|Battle of the Overpass, May 26, 1937, Walter Reuther fifth from left, Richard Frankensteen sixth from left]]\nBarely a month after the Chrysler signing, Reuther got permission from the [[Dearborn, Michigan|City of Dearborn]] to pass out handbills titled, \"Unionism, not Fordism\" on public property at Gate Four of the giant [[Ford River Rouge Complex]].

Shortly after, Henry Ford told Walter Reuther: \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\" Reuther inquired, \"What do you mean?\" Ford replied, \"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd.

That plan, however, would have taken two years to begin producing planes. The Allies did not have that time to spare. In response, Reuther proposed \"to transform the entire unused capacity of the auto industry into one huge plane production unit capable of turning out 500 Planes a Day.\" After getting the support of workers, he publicly announced the \"Reuther Plan: 500 Planes a Day,\" shortly before Christmas, 1940.<ref>{{Cite book|title=FDR, the war president, 1940\u20131943 : a history|last=1912\u20131999.|first=Davis, Kenneth S.

If that target company refused offer concessions, Reuther would threaten a strike to halt production at its plants only while allowing production operations at its competitors' plants to go uninterrupted. As a result, the target company would accept Reuther's demands to prevent its competitors from absorbing its sales and market share. Once he secured the initial agreement, he would use it as a pattern against the other automobile companies, threatening to strike if they too did not match the same terms to which the initial target company agreed. Reuther employed pattern bargaining to leverage competition among automobile manufacturers, maximize the influence of labor, and reduce the frequency of costly strikes.<ref name=\"Alfred. 2009 149\"/>\n\nReuther tried to negotiate lower automobile prices for consumers with each contract, with limited success.<ref>Victor G.

With that employment assurance, the brothers embarked on a three-year adventure, first bicycling through Europe, then working in the auto plant in [[Gorky, Russia]] where the unheated factories were often 30\u201340 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.

Upon his return he became president of newly formed Local 174 on Detroit's west side and with brother Victor, led the first successful strike against the automotive giants at Kelsey Hayes, which supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford Motor Company. The main complaint was the speed-up of the assembly line was intolerable. Workers were losing limbs and even their own lives trying in vain to keep up with the ever-increasing speed of the assembly line. It was December 1936 when the workers pulled a surprise strike and sat down in the plant refusing to leave until management negotiated with their representative, Walter Reuther.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reuther|last=Frank.|first=Cormier|date=1970|publisher=Prentice-Hall|others=Eaton, William J.|isbn=9780137793143|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/reuther00corm/page/70 70\u201373]|oclc=91809|url=https://archive.org/details/reuther00corm/page/70}}</ref>\n\nWhen management tried to enter the plant to remove the machinery, thousands of sympathizers swarmed the sidewalks and blocked the doorways. Ford needed those brake drums and wheels badly and after 10 days of striking the sides settled. The first major UAW victory to unionize the auto factories was won. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work: 75 cents an hour. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Putting the world together : my father Walter Reuther, the liberal warrior|last=Reuther.|first=Dickmeyer, Elisabeth|date=2004|publisher=LivingForce Pub|isbn=9780975379219|location=Lake Orion, Mich.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/39 39\u201341]|oclc=57172289|url=https://archive.org/details/puttingworldtoge0000dick/page/39}}</ref>\n\n=== General Motors ===\nIn 1936, [[General Motors]] (GM) was the largest corporation in the world and held many plants in [[Flint, Michigan]], about 60 miles north of Detroit. Reuther's brother, Roy, was already in Flint drawing up strategy plans and organizing workers to shut down the automaker until it would recognize the rights of the workers to unionize. The strike began on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1936 when the workers sat down in the plants and refused to leave. General Motors retaliated by turning off the heat in the plant.\n\nIn solidarity with the Flint strikers, Reuther led a strike at Detroit's Fleetwood Plant, where bodies were made for GM's luxury vehicle, the Cadillac. Support strikes were also called in Oakland, California, Pontiac, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri. Autoworkers around the nation engaged in action in support of the Flint sit-down strikers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The brothers Reuther and the story of the UAW : a memoir|last=Reuther |first= Victor G.|date=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395275153|edition=  UAW special |location=Boston|pages=150|oclc=26295254}}</ref>\n\nBack in Flint, the police tried to force the workers out of the plant in what became known as the \"Battle of Bulls Run.\" Over a hundred policemen attacked the pickets with tear gas and bullets, sending thirteen workers to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Victor manned the sound car and encouraged the workers to fight back, which they did by sling-shotting door hinges from the factory roof and turning fire hoses on the police in the 16-degree Fahrenheit winter night. Victor and Genora Johnson, a leader of the Women's Brigade, took turns in the sound car exhorting the workers to stand their ground.\n\nMichigan Governor, [[Frank Murphy]], called in 2,000 members of the National Guard, not to force the workers out of the plants, but to keep the peace. After a brilliant move, the workers were able to gain control of the only plant in the country that made [[Chevrolet]] engines. Finally, 44 days later, General Motors was forced to recognize the worker's right to unionize and signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the fledgling UAW.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The brothers Reuther and the story of the UAW : a memoir|last=Reuther |first= Victor G.|date=1978|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780395275153|edition=  UAW special |location=Boston|oclc=26295254}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Flint sit-down strike|Flint Sit-Down Strike]] has become known as the Lexington and Valley Forge of American industrial unionism. Roy recalled, \"When the boys came out of the plants, I never saw a night like that and perhaps will never see it again. I liken it to a country experiencing independence, families reunited for the first time since the strike began, kids hanging onto daddy with tears of joy and happiness.

His main enforcer was [[Harry Bennett]], who led a 3,000 man Security Department for Ford Motor Company, whose mandate was to intimidate, beat, and fire any worker who showed signs of favoring unionization. In 1932, when workers marched out of the giant [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] in protest to the speed-up of the assembly lines, they were attacked by Bennett's armed men and 5 workers were shot dead and hundreds suffered injuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=LIFE AND TIMES OF WALTER REUTHER.|last=JAMES.|first=TENEYCK|date=2016|publisher=PAGE PUBLISHING, INC|isbn=9781683482086|location=[S.l.]|pages=212|oclc=975986306}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Labor-Strike-Ford Motor Company-Walter Reuther fifth from the left-Richard Frankensteen sixth from the left - NARA - 195593.tif|thumb|Battle of the Overpass, May 26, 1937, Walter Reuther fifth from left, Richard Frankensteen sixth from left]]\nBarely a month after the Chrysler signing, Reuther got permission from the [[Dearborn, Michigan|City of Dearborn]] to pass out handbills titled, \"Unionism, not Fordism\" on public property at Gate Four of the giant [[Ford River Rouge Complex]].

Shortly after, Henry Ford told Walter Reuther: \"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\" Reuther inquired, \"What do you mean?\" Ford replied, \"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd.

If that target company refused offer concessions, Reuther would threaten a strike to halt production at its plants only while allowing production operations at its competitors' plants to go uninterrupted. As a result, the target company would accept Reuther's demands to prevent its competitors from absorbing its sales and market share. Once he secured the initial agreement, he would use it as a pattern against the other automobile companies, threatening to strike if they too did not match the same terms to which the initial target company agreed. Reuther employed pattern bargaining to leverage competition among automobile manufacturers, maximize the influence of labor, and reduce the frequency of costly strikes.<ref name=\"Alfred. 2009 149\"/>\n\nReuther tried to negotiate lower automobile prices for consumers with each contract, with limited success.<ref>Victor G.

Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|10-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 Pro is the first water-resistant OnePlus phone, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. Both will be available in Onyx Black and Glacial Green and will receive their own color. The 8 has an Interstellar Glow finish, while the 8 Pro has an Ultramarine Blue finish. A Polar Silver finish on the 8 is exclusive to the Verizon model.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth|10-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera, making this a feature exclusive to the 8 Pro; instead, it opts to crop out from the wide sensor. The 8 Pro's ultrawide sensor receives a boost in resolution from 16 MP to 48 MP, but its telephoto sensor does not receive significant upgrades. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of new 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|www.oneplus.com/8}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-bef\n| before = [[OnePlus 7T|OnePlus 7T & 7T Pro]]\n}}\n{{S-ttl\n| title = OnePlus 8 & 8 Pro\n| years = 2020\n}}\n{{S-inc|recent\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{OnePlus|state=collapsed}}\n{{Android smartphones}}\n\n[[Category:OnePlus mobile phones]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) devices]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras]]\n", "name_user": "Thanoscar21", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_8"}

Imbault, carried out the detailed design and erection process of the bridge.<ref name=pl-jb /> Architects for the contractors were from the British firm [[John James Burnet|John Burnet & Partners]] of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name=\"glasgowsculpture\"/> Lawrence Ennis, of Dorman Long, served as Director of Construction and primary onsite supervisor throughout the entire build, alongside Edward Judge, Dorman Long's Chief Technical Engineer, who functioned as Consulting and Designing Engineer.\n\nThe building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of [[Sydney underground railways|underground railways]] in Sydney's CBD, known today as the [[City Circle]], and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the [[Northern Beaches]];<ref>{{cite NSW HD|4800281|Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> in the interim they were used to carry [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]], which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction]]\n[[File:Early construction, Sydney Harbour Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The arch being constructed]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March, 1932 (6174053762).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March 1932]]\n[[File:HMAS Canberra sailing into Sydney Harbour in 1930.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|D33|6}} sailing under the completed arch from which the deck is being suspended in 1930]]\nBradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design.  This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge in order to makes things clear <ref>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_plaque.jpg.</ref>\n\nThe official ceremony to mark the \"turning of the first sod\" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.<ref name=\"bos-time\">{{cite web|title=Six million rivets: The timeline|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|work=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=NSW Government: Board of Studies|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151649/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|archive-date=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>North Shore Bridge ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 October 1923 page 417</ref>\n\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced [[Abutment|abutment towers]] were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant [[Crane (machine)|\"creeper crane\"]] was erected on each side of the harbour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholson|first=John|title=Building the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|format=Google books|access-date=10 December 2009|year=2001|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86508-258-5|page=14|quote=There was one creeper crane on each side of the harbour.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101135121/https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with [[Wire rope|steel cables]] passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \"creep\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] from the jibs of the creeper cranes.<ref name=\"bos-time\"/><ref>The Sydney Harbour Bridge ''Railway Gazette'' 18 March 1932 page 433</ref>\n\n[[File:The bridge in curve 1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grace Cossington Smith]]'s painting of the arch under construction.]]\n[[File:JJC Bradfield Sydney Harbour Bridge 1932.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] riding the first test train across the bridge on 19 January 1932]]\nOnce the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical [[Tie (engineering)|hangers]] were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled.

Lanes three, four and five are reversible. One and two always flow north. Six, seven, and eight always flow south. The default is four each way. For the morning rush hour, the lane changes on the bridge also require changes to the [[Warringah Freeway]], with its inner western reversible carriageway directing traffic to the bridge lane numbers three and four southbound.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nThe bridge has a series of overhead gantries which indicate the direction of flow for each traffic lane. A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red \"X\" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red \"X\" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic. This arrangement was introduced in the 1990s, replacing a slow operation where lane markers were manually moved to mark the centre median.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nIt is possible to see odd arrangements of flow during night periods when maintenance occurs, which may involve completely closing some lanes. Normally this is done between midnight and dawn, because of the enormous traffic demands placed on the bridge outside these hours.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nWhen the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in August 1992, Lane 7 became a [[bus lane]].<ref>Harbour Bridge Public Transport Lane ''[[Fleetline (periodical)|Fleetline]]'' issue 198 January 1992 page 13</ref><ref>Opening of Sydney Harbour Tunnel & Gore Hill Freeway ''[[Australian Bus Panorama]]'' issue 8/3 October 1992 page 38</ref>\n\n===Tolls===\n[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge toll gates, 1933.jpg|thumb|Northbound view of toll gates, 1933]]\nThe vehicular traffic lanes on the bridge are operated as a [[toll road]]. As of October 2019, there is a variable tolling system for all vehicles headed into the CBD (southbound). The toll paid is dependent on the time of day in which the vehicle passes through the toll plaza. The toll varies from a minimum value of $2.50 to a maximum value of $4.<ref>[https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/sydney-motorways/documents/sydney-motorways-toll-charges.pdf Sydney Motorway Toll Charges ] Transport for NSW 1 October 2019</ref>  There is no toll for northbound traffic (though taxis travelling north may charge passengers the toll in anticipation of the toll the taxi must pay on the return journey).

This was paid off in 1988, but the toll has been kept (indeed increased) to recoup the costs of the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]].<ref>[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/dont-we-own-the-bridge-yet/news-story/470a79a8df85451a62546f1ee5a43a1f?sv=9d46fd6e74ef2ce70a1cf9189001bdf4 Don't we own the Bridge yet?] ''[[Daily Telegraph (Australia)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 June 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s, the toll was increased (from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the tunnel opened) to pay for its construction. The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nOriginally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Motorcyclists|url = https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|website = www.myrta.com|access-date = 12 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614025012/https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|archive-date = 14 June 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Originally there were six toll booths at the southern end of the bridge, these were replaced by 16 booths in 1950.<ref>Sydney Harbour Bridge ''[[Truck & Bus Transportation]]'' March 1950 page 9</ref> The toll was charged in both directions until 4 July 1970 when changed to only be applied to southbound traffic.<ref>Reaching the North ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 200 June 1982 page 23</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called [[e-TAG]] was introduced.

A light-show began after sunset and continued late into the night, the bridge being bathed in constantly changing, multi-coloured lighting, designed to highlight structural features of the bridge. In the evening the bright yellow caps were replaced by orange caps with a small, bright [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] attached.

The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the [[Northern Beaches]];<ref>{{cite NSW HD|4800281|Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> in the interim they were used to carry [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]], which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour Bridge under construction]]\n[[File:Early construction, Sydney Harbour Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The arch being constructed]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March, 1932 (6174053762).jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Sydney and Circular Quay on the day of the official opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, 19 March 1932]]\n[[File:HMAS Canberra sailing into Sydney Harbour in 1930.jpg|thumb|{{HMAS|Canberra|D33|6}} sailing under the completed arch from which the deck is being suspended in 1930]]\n\n\nBradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design.  This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge in order to makes things clear <ref>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge_plaque.jpg.</ref>\n\nThe official ceremony to mark the \"turning of the first sod\" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.<ref name=\"bos-time\">{{cite web|title=Six million rivets: The timeline|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|work=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=NSW Government: Board of Studies|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151649/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|archive-date=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>North Shore Bridge ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 October 1923 page 417</ref>\n\nAn estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nAs construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced [[Abutment|abutment towers]] were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nOnce work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant [[Crane (machine)|\"creeper crane\"]] was erected on each side of the harbour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholson|first=John|title=Building the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|format=Google books|access-date=10 December 2009|year=2001|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86508-258-5|page=14|quote=There was one creeper crane on each side of the harbour.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101135121/https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with [[Wire rope|steel cables]] passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.<ref name=\"bos-time\" />\n\nArch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would \"creep\" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] from the jibs of the creeper cranes.<ref name=\"bos-time\"/><ref>The Sydney Harbour Bridge ''Railway Gazette'' 18 March 1932 page 433</ref>\n\n[[File:The bridge in curve 1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grace Cossington Smith]]'s painting of the arch under construction.]]\n[[File:JJC Bradfield Sydney Harbour Bridge 1932.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] riding the first test train across the bridge on 19 January 1932]]\nOnce the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical [[Tie (engineering)|hangers]] were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled.

A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red \"X\" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red \"X\" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic.

The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\nOriginally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Motorcyclists|url = https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|website = www.myrta.com|access-date = 12 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614025012/https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|archive-date = 14 June 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Originally there were six toll booths at the southern end of the bridge, these were replaced by 16 booths in 1950.<ref>Sydney Harbour Bridge ''[[Truck & Bus Transportation]]'' March 1950 page 9</ref> The toll was charged in both directions until 4 July 1970 when changed to only be applied to southbound traffic.<ref>Reaching the North ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 200 June 1982 page 23</ref>\n\nIn July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called [[e-TAG]] was introduced.

A campaign to eliminate the steps on this popular cycling route to the CBD has been running since at least 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyharbourlink.com/page/about |title=HarbourLink |publisher=Sydneyharbourlink.com |date= |access-date=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126184320/http://www.sydneyharbourlink.com/page/about |archive-date=26 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/www/html/5539-harbourlink-project.asp HarbourLink \u2013 North Sydney Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022020136/http://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/www/html/5539-harbourlink-project.asp |date=22 October 2012 }}</ref> On 7 December 2016 the [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)#Minister for Roads|NSW Roads Minister]] [[Duncan Gay]] confirmed that the northern stairway would be replaced with a {{AUD}}20 million ramp alleviating the needs for cyclists to dismount.

The occasion was marked with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the [[Governor of New South Wales|governor]], [[Marie Bashir]] and the premier of New South Wales, [[Morris Iemma]]. The bridge was subsequently open to the public to walk southward from [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] or [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]]. Several major roads, mainly in the CBD, were closed for the day. An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] [[smoking ceremony]] was held at 19:00.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ma.as/375296|title=Cap marking 75th anniversary of Sydney Harbour Bridge|author=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences|publisher=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Australia|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pictures.reuters.com/archive/AUSTRALIA-BRIDGE--GM1DUVNVPKAA.html|title=REUTERS|last=|first=|date=18 March 2007|website=REUTERS|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nApproximately 250,000 people (50,000 more than were registered) took part in the event. Bright yellow souvenir caps were distributed to walkers. A series of speakers placed at intervals along the bridge formed a [[sound installation]]. Each group of speakers broadcast sound and music from a particular era (e.g. [[King Edward VIII]]'s abdication speech; [[Gough Whitlam]]'s speech at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975]]), the overall effect being that the soundscape would \"flow\" through history as walkers proceeded along the bridge. A light-show began after sunset and continued late into the night, the bridge being bathed in constantly changing, multi-coloured lighting, designed to highlight structural features of the bridge. In the evening the bright yellow caps were replaced by orange caps with a small, bright [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] attached. The bridge was closed to walkers at about 20:30.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}\n\n===Breakfast on the Bridge (2009\u201310)===\nOn 25 October 2009, turf was laid across the eight lanes of bitumen, and 6,000 people celebrated a picnic on the bridge accompanied by live music.<ref name=\"abc-pic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/25/2723473.htm|title=Harbour Bridge picnic may become annual|date=25 October 2009|access-date=5 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028031633/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/25/2723473.htm|archive-date=28 October 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The event was repeated in 2010.<ref name=\"Sydney International Food Festival\">{{cite web|title=Breakfast on the Bridge|url=http://www.cravesydney.com/cmspage.php?intid=391&linkid=413|access-date=8 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716223725/http://cravesydney.com/cmspage.php?intid=391&linkid=413|archive-date=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although originally scheduled again in 2011, this event was moved to [[Bondi Beach]] due to traffic concerns about the prolonged closing of the bridge.<ref name=\"bridgePicnic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theprogram.com.au/Event/01-10-2011/breakfast-on-the-bridge|title=Breakfast on the Bridge|date=1 October 2011|access-date=8 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228081304/http://www.theprogram.com.au/Event/01-10-2011/breakfast-on-the-bridge|archive-date=28 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"picnicMoved\">{{cite web|title=Breakfast moves from bridge to beach|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/breakfast-moves-from-the-bridge-to-the-beach-20111014-1lp3j.html|date=15 October 2011|access-date=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105123226/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/breakfast-moves-from-the-bridge-to-the-beach-20111014-1lp3j.html|archive-date=5 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===80th anniversary===\nOn 19 March 2012, the 80th anniversary of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was celebrated with a picnic dedicated to the stories of people with personal connections to the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/newsevents/events/shb80.html |title=Sydney Harbour Bridge 80th Birthday |publisher=New South Wales government, Department of Transport, Roads & Maritime Services |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319013627/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/newsevents/events/shb80.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 }}</ref> In addition, Google dedicated its [[Google Doodle]] on the 19th to the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/google-doodles-for-sydney-harbour-bridge-birthday-79774|title=Google doodles for Sydney Harbour Bridge 80th birthday|publisher=Mumbrella|access-date=19 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320004944/http://mumbrella.com.au/google-doodles-for-sydney-harbour-bridge-birthday-79774|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nThe proposal to upgrade the bridge tolling equipment was announced by the NSW Roads Minister [[Duncan Gay]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Harbour Bridge celebrates 80th birthday|work=AAP|publisher=The Age|date=19 March 2012|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/harbour-bridge-celebrates-80th-birthday-20120319-1ve73.html|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Quotations==\n[[File:ASCE 1988 plaque Sydney Harbour Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The \"International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark\" plaque presented to Sydney Harbour Bridge by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1988]]\n\n{{quote|There the proud arch Colossus like bestride<br />Yon glittering streams and bound the strafing tide.|Prophetic observation of Sydney Cove by [[Erasmus Darwin]], grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], from his poem \"Visit of Hope to Sydney Cove, near Botany Bay\", (1789).}}\n\n{{quote|I open this bridge in the name of His Majesty the King and all the decent citizens of NSW.|Francis de Groot \"opening\" the Sydney Harbour Bridge, (1932).

The opposite of mobilization is [[demobilization]].\n\nMobilization became an issue with the introduction of [[conscription]], and the introduction of the railways in the 19th century. Mobilization institutionalized the mass levy of conscripts that was first introduced during the [[French Revolution]], and that had changed the character of war. A number of technological and societal changes promoted the move towards a more organized way of deployment. These included the [[telegraph]] to provide rapid communication, the railways to provide rapid movement and concentration of troops, and conscription to provide a trained [[Military reserve force|reserve]] of soldiers in case of war.\n\n==Roman Empire==\nThe [[Roman Empire]] was able to mobilize at various times between 6% (81\u201383 BCE) to as much as 10% (210s BCE) of the total Roman population, in emergencies and for short periods of time.<ref name=\"LigtNorthwood2008\">{{cite book|author1=Luuk de Ligt|author2=S.

For example, in 1812 Bonaparte led an army of 600,000 [[French invasion of Russia|to Moscow]] while feeding off plentiful agricultural products introduced by the turn of the century, such as potatoes.<ref>Vincennes, Archive de l\u2019Arm\u00e8e de Terre (AAT), 7N848, Gaston Bodart, \u201cDie Starkeverhaltnisse in den bedeutesten Schlachten.\u201d Craig, ''The Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz''.</ref> Despite the advantages of mass armies, mobilizing forces of this magnitude took much more time than it had in the past.<ref name=\"Howard\">Michael Howard, The Franco-Prussian War (1961; London: Granada, 1979), p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Italian War of Independence]] illustrated all of the problems in modern army mobilization.

The other Great Powers ([[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) all relied on compulsory military service to supply each of their armies with the millions of men they believed they would need to win a major war. France enacted the \u201c[[Conscription in France|Three Year Law]]\u201d (1913) to extend the service of conscripted soldiers to match the size of the German army, as the French population of 40 million was smaller than the German population of 65 million people.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/germany.htm\n |title=Population of Germany\n |publisher=Tacitus.nu |date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> The [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] began, sparked by the German enactment of the [[German Naval Laws|Second Naval Law]]. Each of the Great Powers could only afford to keep a fraction of these men in uniform in peacetime, the rest were [[military reserve|reservists]] with limited opportunities to train. Maneuvering formations of millions of men with limited military training required intricate plans with no room for error, confusion, or discretion after mobilization began. These plans were prepared under the assumption of [[scenario|worst-case scenarios]].\n\nFor example, German military leaders did not plan to mobilize for war with Russia whilst assuming that France would not come to her ally's aid, or vice versa. The [[Schlieffen Plan]] therefore dictated not only mobilization against both powers, but also the order of attack\u2014France would be attacked first regardless of the diplomatic circumstances. To bypass the fortified Franco-German frontier, the German forces were to be ordered to march through [[Belgium]]. Whether or not Russia had committed the first provocation, the German plan agreed to by [[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]] called for the attack on Russia to take place only after France was defeated.\n\n[[File:Mobilisatiezakboekje van Joseph-Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Vandebroek, item 3.jpg|thumb|left|Belgian army mobilisation papers to join a [[Lancers|Lanciers]] regiment]]\nSimilarly, the Russian [[Stavka]]'s war planning assumed that war against either Austria-Hungary or Germany would mean war against the other power. Although the plan allowed flexibility as to whether the main effort would be made against Germany or Austria-Hungary, in either case units would be mobilized on the frontiers of both Powers. On July 28, 1914, [[Tsar Nicholas II]] of Russia (William's cousin) ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary only. While war with Austria-Hungary seemed inevitable, Nicholas [[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence|engaged in a personal dialogue with the German Emperor]] in an attempt to avoid war with Germany. However, Nicholas was advised that attempts to improvise a partial mobilization would lead to chaos and probable defeat if, as pessimists on the Russian side expected, no amount of diplomacy could convince the Germans to refrain from attacking Russia whilst she was engaged with Germany's ally. On July 29, 1914, the Tsar ordered full mobilization, then changed his mind after receiving a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm. Partial mobilization was ordered instead.\n\nThe next day, the Tsar's [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|foreign minister]], [[Sergey Sazonov]] once more persuaded Nicholas of the need for general mobilization, and the order was issued that day, July 30.  In response, Germany declared war on Russia.\n\nGermany mobilized under [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke|von Moltke the Younger]]'s revised version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which assumed a [[two-front war]] with Russia and France. Like Russia, Germany decided to follow its two-front plans despite the one-front war. Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914, one day after issuing an ultimatum to Belgium demanding the right of German troops to pass through as part of the planned pincer action of the military. Finally, Britain declared war on Germany for violating Belgian neutrality.\n\nThus the entangling alliances of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and the [[Triple Entente]] directed the intricate plans for mobilization. This brought all of the Great Powers of Europe into the Great War without actually utilizing the provisions of either alliance.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-022-19A, Mobilmachung, Truppentransport mit der Bahn.jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers in a railway [[Passenger car (rail)|car]] on the way to the front in August 1914. The message on the car reads '''Von M\u00fcnchen \u00fcber Metz nach Paris'''. (From [[Munich]] via [[Metz]] to [[Paris]]).]]\n\nThe mobilization was like a holiday for many of the inexperienced soldiers; for example, some Germans wore flowers in the muzzles of their rifles as they marched. Trains brought soldiers to the front lines of battle. The Germans timetabled the movements of 11,000 trains as they brought troops across the [[Rhine River]]. The French mobilized around 7,000 trains for movement. [[Horse]]s were also mobilized [[Horses in World War I|for war]]. The British had 165,000 horses prepared for [[cavalry]], the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians over a million.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|loc=(footnote points to Bucholz, p. 163) pp. 73-74}}</ref>\n\nBritain's [[Dominion]]s including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] were compelled to go to war when Britain did. However, it was largely left up to the individual Dominions to recruit and equip forces for the war effort. Canadian, Australian and New Zealand mobilizations all involved the creation of new field forces for overseas service rather than using the existing regimental structures as a framework. In the case of Canada, the Militia Minister, Sir [[Sam Hughes]], created the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] from whole cloth by sending telegrams to 226 separate reserve unit commanders asking for volunteers to muster at [[Valcartier]] in Quebec. The field force served separately from the [[Permanent Active Militia|Militia]] (Canada's peacetime army); in 1920 the [[Otter Commission]] was compelled to sort out which units would perpetuate the units that served in the trenches\u2014the CEF or the prewar Militia. A unique solution of perpetuations was instituted, and mobilization during the Second World War did not repeat Sir Sam Hughes' model, which has been described by historians as being more closely akin to ancient Scottish clans assembling for battle than a modern, industrialized nation preparing for war.\n\n\"Colonials\" served under British command though, perhaps owing to the limited autonomy granted to the Dominions regarding their respective mobilizations, the Dominions eventually compelled the British government to overrule the objections of some British commanders and let the Dominion forces serve together instead of being distributed amongst various British divisions. The \"colonials\" would go on to be acknowledged by both the British and German high commands as being elite British units. In May 1918, when command of the [[Australian Corps]] passed from [[William Birdwood]] to [[John Monash]], it became the first British Empire formation commanded totally free of British officers.\n\nOn May 23, 1915, Italy entered World War I on the Allied side. Despite being the weakest of the big four Allied powers, the Italians soon managed to populate its army from 560 to 693 infantry battalions in 1916; the army had grown in size from 1 million to 1.5 million soldiers.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|p=275}} (note also: field artillery pieces went from 1,788 to 2,068)</ref> On August 17, 1916, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] entered the war on the Allied side, mobilizing an army of 23 divisions. Romania was quickly defeated however by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Bulgaria went so far as to ultimately mobilize 1.2 million men, more than a quarter of its population of 4.3 million people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.\n\nThe production of supplies gradually increased throughout the war. In Russia, the expansion of industry allowed a 2,000 percent increase in the production of artillery shells - by November 1915, over 1,512,000 artillery shells were being produced per month. In France, a massive mobilization by the female population to work in factories allowed the rate of shell production to reach 100,000 shells a day by 1915.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=275-276}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides also began drawing on larger numbers of soldiers. The British Secretary of State for War, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], appealed for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which was met with an enthusiastic response. 30 new British divisions were created. The response by volunteers allowed the British to put off the introduction of conscription until [[Military Service Act 1916|1916]]. New Zealand [[Conscription in New Zealand|followed suit]], with Canada also eventually introducing conscription with the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] in 1917.\n\nOn April 6, 1917, the [[United States]] entered the war on the Allied side. At the entrance, the U.S. only could mobilize its army of 107,641 soldiers, ranked only seventeenth in size worldwide at the time. The [[United States Navy]] quickly mobilized, adding 5 [[dreadnoughts]] to the Allied navy. However, conscription quickly ensued. By March 1918, 318,000 U.S. soldiers had been mobilized to France. Eventually, by October 1918, a force of  2 million U.S. soldiers joined in the war effort.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=351-353, 372-374}}</ref>\n\n==Mobilization in World War II==\n[[File:Hevosia l\u00e4hd\u00f6ss\u00e4 talvisotaan.jpg|thumb|Horses and carriages requisitioned in the mobilization before the [[Winter War]]]]\n[[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] partly mobilized its troops on August 24, 1939, and fully mobilized on August 30, 1939, following the increased confrontations with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] since [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|March 1939]]. On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland, which prompted both France and Britain to [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declare war]] on Germany. However, they were slow to mobilize, and by the time Poland had been overrun by the Axis powers, only [[Phoney War|minor operations]] had been carried out by the French at the [[Saar River]].\n\nCanada actually carried out a partial mobilization on August 25, 1939, in anticipation of the growing [[diplomatic crisis]]. On September 1, 1939, the [[Canadian Active Service Force]] (a corps-sized force of two divisions) was mobilized even though war was not declared by Canada until September 10, 1939. Only one division went overseas in December 1939, and the government hoped to follow a \"limited liability\" war policy. When France was invaded in May 1940, the Canadian government realized that would not be possible and mobilized three additional divisions, beginning their overseas employment in August 1940 with the dispatch of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] (some units of which were deployed to [[Iceland in World War II|Iceland]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] for garrison duty before moving to the UK). Canada also enacted the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]] in 1940, which among other things compelled men to serve in the military, though conscripts mobilized under the NRMA did not serve overseas until 1944. Conscripts did, however, serve in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in 1943 though the anticipated Japanese defense never materialized due to the evacuation of the enemy garrison before the landings. Service in the Aleutians was not considered \"overseas\" as technically the islands were part of North America.\n\nThe United Kingdom mobilized 22% of its total population for direct military service, more than any other nation of WWII era.<ref name=\"Axelrod2007\">{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbWFgjW6KX8C&pg=PA399|year=2007|publisher=H W Fowler|isbn=978-0-8160-6022-1|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Economic mobilization==\nEconomic mobilization is the preparation of resources for usage in a [[national emergency]] by carrying out changes in the organization of the national economy.<ref>[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermsd/g/economicmob.htm \"Economic mobilization\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414064348/http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermsd/g/economicmob.htm |date=2014-04-14 }}.

The opposite of mobilization is [[demobilization]].\n\nMobilization became an issue with the introduction of [[conscription]], and the introduction of the railways in the 19th century. Mobilization institutionalized the mass levy of conscripts that was first introduced during the [[French Revolution]], and that had changed the character of war. A number of technological and societal changes promoted the move towards a more organized way of deployment. These included the [[telegraph]] to provide rapid communication, the railways to provide rapid movement and concentration of troops, and conscription to provide a trained [[Military reserve force|reserve]] of soldiers in case of war.\n\n==Roman Empire==\nThe [[Roman Empire]] was able to mobilize at various times between 6% (81\u201383 BCE) to as much as 10% (210s BCE) of the total Roman population, in emergencies and for short periods of time.<ref name=\"LigtNorthwood2008\">{{cite book|author1=Luuk de Ligt|author2=S.

For example, in 1812 Bonaparte led an army of 600,000 [[French invasion of Russia|to Moscow]] while feeding off plentiful agricultural products introduced by the turn of the century, such as potatoes.<ref>Vincennes, Archive de l\u2019Arm\u00e8e de Terre (AAT), 7N848, Gaston Bodart, \u201cDie Starkeverhaltnisse in den bedeutesten Schlachten.\u201d Craig, ''The Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz''.</ref> Despite the advantages of mass armies, mobilizing forces of this magnitude took much more time than it had in the past.<ref name=\"Howard\">Michael Howard, The Franco-Prussian War (1961; London: Granada, 1979), p. 23.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Italian War of Independence]] illustrated all of the problems in modern army mobilization.

The other Great Powers ([[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]) all relied on compulsory military service to supply each of their armies with the millions of men they believed they would need to win a major war. France enacted the \u201c[[Conscription in France|Three Year Law]]\u201d (1913) to extend the service of conscripted soldiers to match the size of the German army, as the French population of 40 million was smaller than the German population of 65 million people.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/germany.htm\n |title=Population of Germany\n |publisher=Tacitus.nu |date=2008-08-30 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> The [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] began, sparked by the German enactment of the [[German Naval Laws|Second Naval Law]]. Each of the Great Powers could only afford to keep a fraction of these men in uniform in peacetime, the rest were [[military reserve|reservists]] with limited opportunities to train. Maneuvering formations of millions of men with limited military training required intricate plans with no room for error, confusion, or discretion after mobilization began. These plans were prepared under the assumption of [[scenario|worst-case scenarios]].\n\nFor example, German military leaders did not plan to mobilize for war with Russia whilst assuming that France would not come to her ally's aid, or vice versa. The [[Schlieffen Plan]] therefore dictated not only mobilization against both powers, but also the order of attack\u2014France would be attacked first regardless of the diplomatic circumstances. To bypass the fortified Franco-German frontier, the German forces were to be ordered to march through [[Belgium]]. Whether or not Russia had committed the first provocation, the German plan agreed to by [[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]] called for the attack on Russia to take place only after France was defeated.\n\n[[File:Mobilisatiezakboekje van Joseph-Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Vandebroek, item 3.jpg|thumb|left|Belgian army mobilisation papers to join a [[Lancers|Lanciers]] regiment]]\nSimilarly, the Russian [[Stavka]]'s war planning assumed that war against either Austria-Hungary or Germany would mean war against the other power. Although the plan allowed flexibility as to whether the main effort would be made against Germany or Austria-Hungary, in either case units would be mobilized on the frontiers of both Powers. On July 28, 1914, [[Tsar Nicholas II]] of Russia (William's cousin) ordered partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary only. While war with Austria-Hungary seemed inevitable, Nicholas [[Willy\u2013Nicky correspondence|engaged in a personal dialogue with the German Emperor]] in an attempt to avoid war with Germany. However, Nicholas was advised that attempts to improvise a partial mobilization would lead to chaos and probable defeat if, as pessimists on the Russian side expected, no amount of diplomacy could convince the Germans to refrain from attacking Russia whilst she was engaged with Germany's ally. On July 29, 1914, the Tsar ordered full mobilization, then changed his mind after receiving a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm. Partial mobilization was ordered instead.\n\nThe next day, the Tsar's [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|foreign minister]], [[Sergey Sazonov]] once more persuaded Nicholas of the need for general mobilization, and the order was issued that day, July 30.  In response, Germany declared war on Russia.\n\nGermany mobilized under [[Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke|von Moltke the Younger]]'s revised version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], which assumed a [[two-front war]] with Russia and France. Like Russia, Germany decided to follow its two-front plans despite the one-front war. Germany declared war on France on August 3, 1914, one day after issuing an ultimatum to Belgium demanding the right of German troops to pass through as part of the planned pincer action of the military. Finally, Britain declared war on Germany for violating Belgian neutrality.\n\nThus the entangling alliances of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and the [[Triple Entente]] directed the intricate plans for mobilization. This brought all of the Great Powers of Europe into the Great War without actually utilizing the provisions of either alliance.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-022-19A, Mobilmachung, Truppentransport mit der Bahn.jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers in a railway [[Passenger car (rail)|car]] on the way to the front in August 1914. The message on the car reads '''Von M\u00fcnchen \u00fcber Metz nach Paris'''. (From [[Munich]] via [[Metz]] to [[Paris]]).]]\n\nThe mobilization was like a holiday for many of the inexperienced soldiers; for example, some Germans wore flowers in the muzzles of their rifles as they marched. Trains brought soldiers to the front lines of battle. The Germans timetabled the movements of 11,000 trains as they brought troops across the [[Rhine River]]. The French mobilized around 7,000 trains for movement. [[Horse]]s were also mobilized [[Horses in World War I|for war]]. The British had 165,000 horses prepared for [[cavalry]], the Austrians 600,000, the Germans 715,000, and the Russians over a million.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|loc=(footnote points to Bucholz, p. 163) pp. 73-74}}</ref>\n\nBritain's [[Dominion]]s including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] were compelled to go to war when Britain did. However, it was largely left up to the individual Dominions to recruit and equip forces for the war effort. Canadian, Australian and New Zealand mobilizations all involved the creation of new field forces for overseas service rather than using the existing regimental structures as a framework. In the case of Canada, the Militia Minister, Sir [[Sam Hughes]], created the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] from whole cloth by sending telegrams to 226 separate reserve unit commanders asking for volunteers to muster at [[Valcartier]] in Quebec. The field force served separately from the [[Permanent Active Militia|Militia]] (Canada's peacetime army); in 1920 the [[Otter Commission]] was compelled to sort out which units would perpetuate the units that served in the trenches\u2014the CEF or the prewar Militia. A unique solution of perpetuations was instituted, and mobilization during the Second World War did not repeat Sir Sam Hughes' model, which has been described by historians as being more closely akin to ancient Scottish clans assembling for battle than a modern, industrialized nation preparing for war.\n\n\"Colonials\" served under British command though, perhaps owing to the limited autonomy granted to the Dominions regarding their respective mobilizations, the Dominions eventually compelled the British government to overrule the objections of some British commanders and let the Dominion forces serve together instead of being distributed amongst various British divisions. The \"colonials\" would go on to be acknowledged by both the British and German high commands as being elite British units. In May 1918, when command of the [[Australian Corps]] passed from [[William Birdwood]] to [[John Monash]], it became the first British Empire formation commanded totally free of British officers.\n\nOn May 23, 1915, Italy entered World War I on the Allied side. Despite being the weakest of the big four Allied powers, the Italians soon managed to populate its army from 560 to 693 infantry battalions in 1916; the army had grown in size from 1 million to 1.5 million soldiers.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|p=275}} (note also: field artillery pieces went from 1,788 to 2,068)</ref> On August 17, 1916, [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] entered the war on the Allied side, mobilizing an army of 23 divisions. Romania was quickly defeated however by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Bulgaria went so far as to ultimately mobilize 1.2 million men, more than a quarter of its population of 4.3 million people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.\n\nThe production of supplies gradually increased throughout the war. In Russia, the expansion of industry allowed a 2,000 percent increase in the production of artillery shells - by November 1915, over 1,512,000 artillery shells were being produced per month. In France, a massive mobilization by the female population to work in factories allowed the rate of shell production to reach 100,000 shells a day by 1915.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=275-276}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides also began drawing on larger numbers of soldiers. The British Secretary of State for War, [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], appealed for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which was met with an enthusiastic response. 30 new British divisions were created. The response by volunteers allowed the British to put off the introduction of conscription until [[Military Service Act 1916|1916]]. New Zealand [[Conscription in New Zealand|followed suit]], with Canada also eventually introducing conscription with the [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]] in 1917.\n\nOn April 6, 1917, the [[United States]] entered the war on the Allied side. At the entrance, the U.S. only could mobilize its army of 107,641 soldiers, ranked only seventeenth in size worldwide at the time. The [[United States Navy]] quickly mobilized, adding 5 [[dreadnoughts]] to the Allied navy. However, conscription quickly ensued. By March 1918, 318,000 U.S. soldiers had been mobilized to France. Eventually, by October 1918, a force of  2 million U.S. soldiers joined in the war effort.<ref>{{harvp|Keegan|1999|pp=351-353, 372-374}}</ref>\n\n==Mobilization in World War II==\n[[File:Hevosia l\u00e4hd\u00f6ss\u00e4 talvisotaan.jpg|thumb|Horses and carriages requisitioned in the mobilization before the [[Winter War]]]]\n[[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] partly mobilized its troops on August 24, 1939, and fully mobilized on August 30, 1939, following the increased confrontations with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] since [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|March 1939]]. On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland, which prompted both France and Britain to [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declare war]] on Germany. However, they were slow to mobilize, and by the time Poland had been overrun by the Axis powers, only [[Phoney War|minor operations]] had been carried out by the French at the [[Saar River]].\n\nCanada actually carried out a partial mobilization on August 25, 1939, in anticipation of the growing [[diplomatic crisis]]. On September 1, 1939, the [[Canadian Active Service Force]] (a corps-sized force of two divisions) was mobilized even though war was not declared by Canada until September 10, 1939. Only one division went overseas in December 1939, and the government hoped to follow a \"limited liability\" war policy. When France was invaded in May 1940, the Canadian government realized that would not be possible and mobilized three additional divisions, beginning their overseas employment in August 1940 with the dispatch of the [[2nd Canadian Division]] (some units of which were deployed to [[Iceland in World War II|Iceland]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] for garrison duty before moving to the UK). Canada also enacted the [[National Resources Mobilization Act]] in 1940, which among other things compelled men to serve in the military, though conscripts mobilized under the NRMA did not serve overseas until 1944. Conscripts did, however, serve in the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] in 1943 though the anticipated Japanese defense never materialized due to the evacuation of the enemy garrison before the landings. Service in the Aleutians was not considered \"overseas\" as technically the islands were part of North America.\n\nThe United Kingdom mobilized 22% of its total population for direct military service, more than any other nation of WWII era.<ref name=\"Axelrod2007\">{{cite book|author=Alan Axelrod|title=Encyclopedia of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbWFgjW6KX8C&pg=PA399|year=2007|publisher=H W Fowler|isbn=978-0-8160-6022-1|page=399}}</ref>\n\n==Economic mobilization==\nEconomic mobilization is the preparation of resources for usage in a [[national emergency]] by carrying out changes in the organization of the national economy.<ref>[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermsd/g/economicmob.htm \"Economic mobilization\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414064348/http://usmilitary.about.com/od/glossarytermsd/g/economicmob.htm |date=2014-04-14 }}.
