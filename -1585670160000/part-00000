It is separated from the [[Los Angeles Basin]] by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] to the south, and from [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]] by the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the north. The population of Lancaster has grown from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 159,000 as of 2018.\n\n==History==\n{{advert|section|a tourist brochure|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe area where Lancaster is now located, known as the [[Antelope Valley]], was originally home to the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians. Lancaster's origins as a settlement start with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], which is believed to first use the name Lancaster, where a station house, locomotive watering facilities and section gang housing were built when the railroad laid track through the town's future location. In 1876 the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/about-us/history-of-lancaster/1876-1910-the-beginning |title=1876-1910: The Beginning - City of Lancaster |author= |date= |website=Cityoflancasterca.org |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> linking [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]]. The origin of Lancaster's name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former Pennsylvania home ([[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the Lancaster News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, Lancaster was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.\n\n[[File:Lancaster, California. Sign on main street designating military zone. - NARA - 536860.jpg|thumb|right|A sign designating the military zone of Lancaster, 1942]]\nThe town was devastated by the decade-long drought that began in 1894, killing businesses and driving cattle north, though fortunes improved somewhat in 1898 following the nearby discoveries of gold and borax, the latter to become a widespread industrial chemical and household cleaner. Thanks to the five-year construction of the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct starting in 1908, Lancaster became a boom town by housing aqueduct workers. The 1912 completion of Antelope Valley Union High School allowed students from the growing region to study locally instead of moving to distant cities, and the school boasted the state's first dormitory system to accommodate students from outlying districts. The community began a steady growth spurt in the 1930s, starting with construction of Muroc Air Force Base, site of frequent flight tests, including the \"breaking\" of the [[sound barrier]] by [[Chuck Yeager]] in a [[Bell X-1A]] in 1947. From the 1980s through the end of the program, [[Edwards Air Force Base]], by then renamed, hosted a limited number of landings of the [[Space Shuttle]]. The development of [[Air Force Plant 42]] in 1958, augmented in the 1960s by construction of [[Lockheed Aircraft]]'s Plant 10, created tens of thousands of jobs. High-wage employment hit its peak in the 1970s during the [[Lockheed L-1011]] commercial wide body jetliner project, for which all assembly and some engineering and parts production were performed. 250 L-1011 aircraft were assembled and flown from this plant and airfield. Lancaster was an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County until 1977, when it was incorporated as a city, with Arnold Rodio serving as its first mayor.\n\n[[California State Prison, Los Angeles County|Lancaster State Prison]] opened in 1993 and before that Los Angeles County hosted no prisons but accounted for forty percent of California's state-prison inmates.<ref>Wolcott, Denis.

Notable projects assembled and/or designed there include the [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters, [[B-1 Lancer]] bomber, [[B-2 Spirit]] bomber, [[F-117 Nighthawk]] fighter, [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]], and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]], a wide body passenger jet aircraft. The region is also proximate to the [[Mojave Air & Space Port]], which is famous as the base of operations for Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composites, the company that designed SpaceShipOne and won the X-Prize.\n\nIn 2010, the city opened The BLVD, a one-mile revitalized stretch of Lancaster Boulevard between 10th Street West and Sierra Highway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|title=City of Lancaster's BLVD Transformation Completed|website=cityoflancasterca.org|accessdate=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214101546/http://cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|archive-date=December 14, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCity leaders have set the ambitious goal of becoming the nation's first Net-Zero municipality, wherein they will produce more clean energy than they consume. Much of the city's infrastructure including City Hall, local schools, and even their minor league baseball stadium are solar powered. In March 2013, Lancaster became the first city in the US to require solar panels on all new homes in an effort to make the community more carbon neutral.  The rule took effect in January, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/lancaster-to-require-solar-on-every-new-home|title=California City Wants to Require Solar on Every New Home|author=|date=|website=greentechmedia.com|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===War Eagle Field / Mira Loma===\n[[War Eagle Field]] is a former airfield located in the Mojave Desert, about {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} west of central Lancaster.\n\n[[Polaris Flight Academy]], which opened on the field's grounds on July 15, 1941, trained cadets for the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. (The school also used two auxiliary fields, Liberty Field and Victory Field.) The airfield had two hard-surfaced [[bituminous]] runways, one of 3,100' aligned NE/SW (05/23) the other of 2,950' aligned E/W (09/27).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter the Japanese attack of [[Pearl Harbor]], the flight school began training cadets for the [[United States Army Air Force]] on 28 July 1942, being operated by the Polaris Flight Academy as a contract basic [[flying school]] (phase 1). The primary trainer in use was the [[BT-13 Valiant]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1944, the flight school changed its name to Mira Loma Flight Academy. The airfield inactivated on 1 October 1945 and was declared surplus in 1946. Responsibility for it was given to the [[War Assets Administration]]. The land was then bought by Los Angeles County. The airfield was converted to [[Mira Loma Detention Center]]. In 2012, Los Angeles County closed the detention center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/17/opinion/la-ed-miraloma-20121017|title=The Mira Loma Detention Center mess|author=|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 29, 2018|via=LA Times}}</ref> Los Angeles County is currently collaborating with the City of Lancaster, the [[faith-based community]], and the non-profit community to convert the facility into a winter shelter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahsa.org/winter_shelter_program|title=Error 404|author=|date=|website=Lahsa.org|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany wartime buildings, including two still intact hangars, are still in use.

Lancaster's [[elevation]] is {{convert|2350|ft|m}} above sea level on a high, flat valley surrounded by pristine mountain ranges. Because the elevation is in the range of 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600\u2013900&nbsp;m) above sea level, the area, like the other parts of the Mojave Desert region, is alternatively referred to as the High Desert.

It is separated from the [[Los Angeles Basin]] by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] to the south, and from [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]] by the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the north. The population of Lancaster has grown from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 159,000 as of 2018.\n\n==History==\n{{advert|section|a tourist brochure|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe area where Lancaster is now located, known as the [[Antelope Valley]], was originally home to the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians. Lancaster's origins as a settlement start with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], which is believed to first use the name Lancaster, where a station house, locomotive watering facilities and section gang housing were built when the railroad laid track through the town's future location. In 1876 the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/about-us/history-of-lancaster/1876-1910-the-beginning |title=1876-1910: The Beginning - City of Lancaster |author= |date= |website=Cityoflancasterca.org |accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref> linking [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]]. The origin of Lancaster's name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former Pennsylvania home ([[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the Lancaster News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, Lancaster was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.\n\n[[File:Lancaster, California. Sign on main street designating military zone. - NARA - 536860.jpg|thumb|right|A sign designating the military zone of Lancaster, 1942]]\nThe town was devastated by the decade-long drought that began in 1894, killing businesses and driving cattle north, though fortunes improved somewhat in 1898 following the nearby discoveries of gold and borax, the latter to become a widespread industrial chemical and household cleaner. Thanks to the five-year construction of the 233-mile Los Angeles Aqueduct starting in 1908, Lancaster became a boom town by housing aqueduct workers. The 1912 completion of Antelope Valley Union High School allowed students from the growing region to study locally instead of moving to distant cities, and the school boasted the state's first dormitory system to accommodate students from outlying districts. The community began a steady growth spurt in the 1930s, starting with construction of Muroc Air Force Base, site of frequent flight tests, including the \"breaking\" of the [[sound barrier]] by [[Chuck Yeager]] in a [[Bell X-1A]] in 1947. From the 1980s through the end of the program, [[Edwards Air Force Base]], by then renamed, hosted a limited number of landings of the [[Space Shuttle]]. The development of [[Air Force Plant 42]] in 1958, augmented in the 1960s by construction of [[Lockheed Aircraft]]'s Plant 10, created tens of thousands of jobs. High-wage employment hit its peak in the 1970s during the [[Lockheed L-1011]] commercial wide body jetliner project, for which all assembly and some engineering and parts production were performed. 250 L-1011 aircraft were assembled and flown from this plant and airfield. Lancaster was an unincorporated community in Los Angeles County until 1977, when it was incorporated as a city, with Arnold Rodio serving as its first mayor.\n\n[[California State Prison, Los Angeles County|Lancaster State Prison]] opened in 1993 and before that Los Angeles County hosted no prisons but accounted for forty percent of California's state-prison inmates.<ref>Wolcott, Denis.

Notable projects assembled and/or designed there include the [[Space Shuttle]] orbiters, [[B-1 Lancer]] bomber, [[B-2 Spirit]] bomber, [[F-117 Nighthawk]] fighter, [[F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]], and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]], a wide body passenger jet aircraft. The region is also proximate to the [[Mojave Air & Space Port]], which is famous as the base of operations for Virgin Galactic and Scaled Composites, the company that designed SpaceShipOne and won the X-Prize.\n\nIn 2010, the city opened The BLVD, a one-mile revitalized stretch of Lancaster Boulevard between 10th Street West and Sierra Highway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|title=City of Lancaster's BLVD Transformation Completed|website=cityoflancasterca.org|accessdate=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214101546/http://cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|archive-date=December 14, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCity leaders have set the ambitious goal of becoming the nation's first Net-Zero municipality, wherein they will produce more clean energy than they consume. Much of the city's infrastructure including City Hall, local schools, and even their minor league baseball stadium are solar powered. In March 2013, Lancaster became the first city in the US to require solar panels on all new homes in an effort to make the community more carbon neutral.  The rule took effect in January, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/lancaster-to-require-solar-on-every-new-home|title=California City Wants to Require Solar on Every New Home|author=|date=|website=greentechmedia.com|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===War Eagle Field / Mira Loma===\n[[War Eagle Field]] is a former airfield located in the Mojave Desert, about {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} west of central Lancaster.\n\n[[Polaris Flight Academy]], which opened on the field's grounds on July 15, 1941, trained cadets for the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. (The school also used two auxiliary fields, Liberty Field and Victory Field.) The airfield had two hard-surfaced [[bituminous]] runways, one of 3,100' aligned NE/SW (05/23) the other of 2,950' aligned E/W (09/27).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter the Japanese attack of [[Pearl Harbor]], the flight school began training cadets for the [[United States Army Air Force]] on 28 July 1942, being operated by the Polaris Flight Academy as a contract basic [[flying school]] (phase 1). The primary trainer in use was the [[BT-13 Valiant]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 1944, the flight school changed its name to Mira Loma Flight Academy. The airfield inactivated on 1 October 1945 and was declared surplus in 1946. Responsibility for it was given to the [[War Assets Administration]]. The land was then bought by Los Angeles County. The airfield was converted to [[Mira Loma Detention Center]]. In 2012, Los Angeles County closed the detention center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/17/opinion/la-ed-miraloma-20121017|title=The Mira Loma Detention Center mess|author=|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 29, 2018|via=LA Times}}</ref> Los Angeles County is currently collaborating with the City of Lancaster, the [[faith-based community]], and the non-profit community to convert the facility into a winter shelter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahsa.org/winter_shelter_program|title=Error 404|author=|date=|website=Lahsa.org|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany wartime buildings, including two still intact hangars, are still in use.

Lancaster's [[elevation]] is {{convert|2350|ft|m}} above sea level on a high, flat valley surrounded by pristine mountain ranges. Because the elevation is in the range of 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600\u2013900&nbsp;m) above sea level, the area, like the other parts of the Mojave Desert region, is alternatively referred to as the High Desert.

His radial urban master plan for Yaroslavl (1778), cleverly highlighting dozens historic churches and towers, is recognized as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nStarov was one of the first graduates of the [[Moscow University]] College (1755&ndash;1758) and of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (1758&ndash;1762). He continued his education in [[Paris]] (1762&ndash;1767) and [[Rome]] (1767&ndash;1768), becoming apprenticed to [[Charles De Wailly]] and other fashionable architects of his day. Back in Russia, he delivered lectures in the Academy of Arts, which nominated him academician (1769) and professor (1785). Starov held the post of the principal architect of St.&nbsp;Petersburg between 1772 and 1774. After that, he worked extensively for [[Prince Potemkin]], helping him to found the major cities of [[New Russia]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIvan Starov was born into a deacon's family.

In 1758 he entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and became the student of [[Alexander Kokorinov]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]]. He graduated with honours and received a money grant and a right to travel abroad to study Arts. From 1762 to 1768 he travelled, in [[Paris]] he studied under [[Charles de Wailly]].\n\nIn 1769 he returned to St Petersburg and designed the project of the [[szlachta]] wing for the cadet corps. For this project he was admitted to membership of the Academy. In a year Starov was ranked an adjunct professor, in 1770 he was promoted to professor. Between 1772-1774 he headed the Committee on Stone Building of Moscow and St Petersburg. In 1790 Starov created the project of Nikolaev city next to the wharf between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Inhul]] rivers. In 1794 he was promoted to adjunct rector.\n\nIvan Starov was buried in the [[Lazarevskoe Cemetery]] of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].\n\n== Family ==\nOn the 30th of March, 1771, Starov married Natalia Deimdova, daughter of rich mine owner [[:ru:\u0414\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Grigory Demidov]].

His radial urban master plan for Yaroslavl (1778), cleverly highlighting dozens historic churches and towers, is recognized as one of the [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nStarov was one of the first graduates of the [[Moscow University]] College (1755&ndash;1758) and of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] (1758&ndash;1762). He continued his education in [[Paris]] (1762&ndash;1767) and [[Rome]] (1767&ndash;1768), becoming apprenticed to [[Charles De Wailly]] and other fashionable architects of his day. Back in Russia, he delivered lectures in the Academy of Arts, which nominated him academician (1769) and professor (1785). Starov held the post of the principal architect of St.&nbsp;Petersburg between 1772 and 1774. After that, he worked extensively for [[Prince Potemkin]], helping him to found the major cities of [[New Russia]].\n\n== Biography ==\nIvan Starov was born into a deacon's family. In 1755 he enrolled into the [[Imperial Moscow University]], a year later transferred to the gymnasium of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1758 he entered the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and became the student of [[Alexander Kokorinov]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]]. He graduated with honours and received a money grant and a right to travel abroad to study Arts. From 1762 to 1768 he travelled, in [[Paris]] he studied under [[Charles de Wailly]].\n\nIn 1769 he returned to St Petersburg and designed the project of the [[szlachta]] wing for the cadet corps. For this project he was admitted to membership of the Academy. In a year Starov was ranked an adjunct professor, in 1770 he was promoted to professor. Between 1772-1774 he headed the Committee on Stone Building of Moscow and St Petersburg. In 1790 Starov created the project of Nikolaev city next to the wharf between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Inhul]] rivers. In 1794 he was promoted to adjunct rector.\n\nIvan Starov was buried in the [[Lazarevskoe Cemetery]] of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].\n\n== Family ==\nOn the 30th of March, 1771, Starov got married to Natalia Deimdova, daughter of rich mine owner [[:ru:\u0414\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Grigory Demidov]]. The prominent architect [[Alexander Kokorinov]] was Starov's best man on the wedding ceremony. On May 20, 1771, the newly wed purchased a mansion on [[Vasilyevsky Island]]. In that house three sons were born \u2014 Alexander, Peter and Paul.

Considered an expansion of coaching and tutoring networks these private expert knowledge networks connect students and faculty to expert resources that have a preexisting relationship with the institution, in an on-demand nature. This often includes expert connections to peers, coaches, tutors, advisors, counselors, and other institutionally related experts.\n\n=== Venture mentor expert networks ===\nMany education institutions have begun using expert network models in support of new venture creation and student entrepreneurship. The concept of Venture Mentor Expert Networks was born out of a need to remedy a gap in how universities support emerging entrepreneurial ventures. as an example, MIT hand selects experts from their alumni network and assigns them to individual ventures/consumers to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and information.\n\n== Business models ==\nThere are three aspects of business models for expert networks: (1) revenue models, (2) sourcing models, and (3) operating models.\nExpert networks may apply two different revenue models: subscription-based and transaction-based (detailed below).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/ebooks-and-reports-download/ | title=EBooks and Reports}}</ref>\n\n=== 1. Revenue models ===\n==== Transaction-based ====\nThe most common revenue model is \"pay-per-use\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/ebooks-and-reports-download/ | title=EBooks and Reports}}</ref>, where an expert networks invoices the client per hour of expert consultation, times the \"credit\" price of the expert. The expert network then pays a part of this to the expert.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/news/2018-6-27-what-is-the-market-size-growth-and-margins-for-expert-networks/ |title = What is the market size, growth and margins of Expert Networks?|date = 2018-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Subscription-based ====\nThe traditional revenue model was to offer subscriptions to clients. This model still represents a large share of the industry, notably for GLG. The client pays for a predefined number of \"credits\" at the start of the contract year, which are run down as expert consultations are made. The network keeps the difference between the subscription fees collected and the hourly rates paid out.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/news/2018-6-27-what-is-the-market-size-growth-and-margins-for-expert-networks/ |title = What is the market size, growth and margins of Expert Networks?|date = 2018-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fioravante |first=Janice |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130210/SMALLBIZ/302109993 |title=M.B.A.s, doctors try freelance route &#124; Crain's New York Business |publisher=Crainsnewyork.com |date=2013-02-12 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== 2. Sourcing models ===\nWhen sourcing experts to connect with clients, an expert network may use either an Internal database, or Custom recruiting (or a combination). Whereas expert networks traditionally relied on internal databases of experts, business models have tilted towards 'custom recruiting' of new experts for each particular case. This was enabled by the rapid growth of LinkedIn in the years following the global financial crisis of 2008,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/274050/quarterly-numbers-of-linkedin-members/|title=Number of LinkedIn users|website=Statista}}</ref> supporting the emergence of firms such as ENG, Third Bridge and AlphaSights (each founded ~ in 2007).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/alphasights/transforming-an-industry-how-alphasights-became-the-leader-in-knowledge-search-efafa7767f4c|title=Transforming an industry: How AlphaSights became the leader in knowledge search|first=Greg|last=Sexton|date=September 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inex.one/news/2018/6/27/how-is-work-in-an-expert-network|title=How is it to work in an expert network?|website=Aggregate your expert insights|date=2018-09-10}}</ref>\n\n=== 3. Operating models ===\nExpert networks structure internal operations differently, along models that transcend their revenue and sourcing models. These have been classified in five categories, each solving the task of supplying relevant experts to customers:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inex.one/news/2018/6/17/how-do-expert-networks-operate|title=How do Expert Networks operate?|website=Aggregate your expert insights|date=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n* Standard expert networks\n* DIY marketplaces\n* Machine-driven expert networks\n* Expert Q&A companies\n* Crowd-funded expert calls\n\nOf the networks covered by the Expert Network Directory, 75% are Standard expert networks, trailed by DIY marketplaces (13%), and machine-driven (8%).<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Investor expert networks==\nA primary example of expert networks are investor networks that are in the business of [[primary research]]. These firms connect [[buy side]] investors, consultants, and business decision-makers with industry experts. Consultations between expert network clients and experts may be in the form of \"face-to-face meetings, phone calls, teleconferences, video conferences, [or] [[email]] exchanges.\"<ref name=\"The Hedge Fund Law Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hflawreport.com/print/article/606 |title=For Hedge Fund Managers, Expert Networks Offer Access to Corporate Insiders While Mitigating (Though Not Eliminating) the Likelihood of Insider Trading Violations |first=Jennifer |last=Banzaca |work=The Hedge Fund Law Report, Vol. 2, No. 48, December 9, 2009 |publisher=Hflawreport.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2009 report by Integrity Research, there are at least 38 investor expert network providers worldwide.<ref name=\"Integrity ResearchFocus: Expert Networks, Integrity Research, 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/cms/our-services/researchfocus/expert-networks/ |title=\"Integrity ResearchFocus: Expert Networks,\" Integrity Research, 2009 |publisher=Integrity-research.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref><ref name=\"Ibid.\">{{cite web|url=http://www.integrity-research.com/cms/our-services/researchfocus/expert-networks/ |title=Integrity ResearchFocus\u00ae: Expert Networks |publisher=Integrity Research |date= |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref> According to a 2018 report by Inex One, that number has grown to at least 50.<ref name=\"Inex Num\"/> Although most expert networks operate across verticals and geographies, recent trends point towards specialized expert networks serving a particular geography or vertical.\n\nIn recent years, as sell-side research has become increasingly \"scarce and less influential,\" [[institutional investors]] have turned to expert networks to gain \"new insights and a competitive edge\" within a compliant framework.

Considered an expansion of coaching and tutoring networks these private expert knowledge networks connect students and faculty to expert resources that have a preexisting relationship with the institution, in an on-demand nature. This often includes expert connections to peers, coaches, tutors, advisors, counselors, and other institutionally related experts.\n\n=== Venture mentor expert networks ===\nMany education institutions have begun using expert network models in support of new venture creation and student entrepreneurship. The concept of Venture Mentor Expert Networks was born out of a need to remedy a gap in how universities support emerging entrepreneurial ventures. as an example, MIT hand selects experts from their alumni network and assigns them to individual ventures/consumers to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and information.\n\n== Business models ==\nThere are three aspects of business models for expert networks: (1) revenue models, (2) sourcing models, and (3) operating models.\nExpert networks may apply two different revenue models: subscription-based and transaction-based (detailed below).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/ebooks-and-reports-download/ | title=EBooks and Reports}}</ref>\n\n=== 1. Revenue models ===\n==== Transaction-based ====\nThe most common revenue model is \"pay-per-use\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/ebooks-and-reports-download/ | title=EBooks and Reports}}</ref>, where an expert networks invoices the client per hour of expert consultation, times the \"credit\" price of the expert. The expert network then pays a part of this to the expert.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/news/2018-6-27-what-is-the-market-size-growth-and-margins-for-expert-networks/ |title = What is the market size, growth and margins of Expert Networks?|date = 2018-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==== Subscription-based ====\nThe traditional revenue model was to offer subscriptions to clients. This model still represents a large share of the industry, notably for GLG. The client pays for a predefined number of \"credits\" at the start of the contract year, which are run down as expert consultations are made. The network keeps the difference between the subscription fees collected and the hourly rates paid out.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://inex.one/news/2018-6-27-what-is-the-market-size-growth-and-margins-for-expert-networks/ |title = What is the market size, growth and margins of Expert Networks?|date = 2018-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fioravante |first=Janice |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130210/SMALLBIZ/302109993 |title=M.B.A.s, doctors try freelance route &#124; Crain's New York Business |publisher=Crainsnewyork.com |date=2013-02-12 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== 2. Sourcing models ===\nWhen sourcing experts to connect with clients, an expert network may use either an Internal database, or Custom recruiting (or a combination). Whereas expert networks traditionally relied on internal databases of experts, business models have tilted towards 'custom recruiting' of new experts for each particular case. This was enabled by the rapid growth of LinkedIn in the years following the global financial crisis of 2008,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/274050/quarterly-numbers-of-linkedin-members/|title=Number of LinkedIn users|website=Statista}}</ref> supporting the emergence of firms such as ENG, Third Bridge and AlphaSights (each founded ~ in 2007).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/alphasights/transforming-an-industry-how-alphasights-became-the-leader-in-knowledge-search-efafa7767f4c|title=Transforming an industry: How AlphaSights became the leader in knowledge search|first=Greg|last=Sexton|date=September 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inex.one/news/2018/6/27/how-is-work-in-an-expert-network|title=How is it to work in an expert network?|website=Aggregate your expert insights|date=2018-09-10}}</ref>\n\n=== 3. Operating models ===\nExpert networks structure internal operations differently, along models that transcend their revenue and sourcing models. These have been classified in five categories, each solving the task of supplying relevant experts to customers:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inex.one/news/2018/6/17/how-do-expert-networks-operate|title=How do Expert Networks operate?|website=Aggregate your expert insights|date=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n* Standard expert networks\n* DIY marketplaces\n* Machine-driven expert networks\n* Expert Q&A companies\n* Crowd-funded expert calls\n\nOf the networks covered by the Expert Network Directory, 75% are Standard expert networks, trailed by DIY marketplaces (13%), and machine-driven (8%).<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Investor expert networks==\nA primary example of expert networks are investor networks that are in the business of [[primary research]]. These firms connect [[buy side]] investors, consultants, and business decision-makers with industry experts.

The race currently covers {{convert|1+1/8|mi|m}} at [[Churchill Downs]]; the horses carry {{convert|121|lb|kg}}. The Kentucky Oaks is held on the Friday before the [[Kentucky Derby]] each year. The winner gets $750,000 of the $1,250,000 purse and a large garland of [[Lilium|lilies]], affectionately called the \"Lillies for the Fillies.\" A silver [[Kentucky Oaks Trophy]] is presented to the winner.\n\n==History==\nThe first running of the Kentucky Oaks was on May 19, 1875, when Churchill Downs was known as the [[Louisville Jockey Club]].<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/kentucky_oaks/oaks_history/|title=Kentucky Oaks History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205195626/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/kentucky_oaks/oaks_history/|archivedate=December 5, 2007}}</ref> The race was founded by [[Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.]] along with the [[Kentucky Derby]], the [[Clark Handicap]], and the [[Falls City Handicap]].<ref name=\"derby\">John E. Kleber, ''The Encyclopedia of Louisville'', Louisville, KY: University Press of Kentucky, p. 467 {{ISBN|0-8131-2100-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Oaks and the Derby are the oldest continuously contested sporting events in American history.<ref name=\"derby\"/> The Kentucky Oaks was modeled after the British [[Epsom Oaks]] which has been run annually at [[Epsom Downs]], [[Epsom]] in Surrey since 1779. In the first race, the horse [[Vinaigrette (horse)|Vinaigrette]] won the then {{frac|1|1|2}} mile race in a time of 2:{{frac|39|3|4}}, winning a purse of $1,175. Since that race the Kentucky Oaks has been held each year.\n\nThe Kentucky Oaks is considered by some to be among the most popular horse races in American horse-racing society due to its high attendance. It has attracted about 100,000 people in attendance each year since 2001's 127th running of the Kentucky Oaks.<ref>Bob Chip Nold, ''Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Kentucky & Southern Indiana, 2nd edition'', Globe Pequot, p. 175 {{ISBN|1-57380-043-0}}</ref> In 1980, attendance reached about 50,000 people and by 1989, it had increased to about 67,000.<ref name=history/> The attendance at the Kentucky Oaks ranks third in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the [[Belmont Stakes]] and the [[Breeders' Cup]]. The attendance of the Kentucky Oaks typically only trails the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes]], for more information see [[American Thoroughbred Racing top Attended Events]].\n\nThe Kentucky Oaks, the [[Black-Eyed Susan Stakes]], and the [[Acorn Stakes]] are the counterparts to the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]], held at [[Churchill Downs]], [[Pimlico Race Course]] and [[Belmont Park]], respectively. The \"Filly Triple Crown\", known as the [[Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing]], is a series of three races at the Belmont Park and [[Saratoga Race Course]]. The [[National Thoroughbred Racing Association]] (NTRA) has considered changing the Triple Tiara series to the three counterparts of the Triple Crown.\n\n==In local culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nDespite the increasing number of out-of-state visitors who attend the race every year, the \"Oaks\" (as local residents simply refer to it) is considered to be a local event by the people of [[Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area|Kentuckiana]] (the [[Ohio Valley]], centered around Louisville, and consisting of much of northern Kentucky and southern [[Indiana]]). Large crowds of Louisvillians and others from the Kentuckiana attend the Oaks annually and the infield of the race track hosts numerous musical attractions, boardwalk games, and food and alcoholic beverage vendors. Bringing in one's own alcohol is forbidden at Churchill Downs and many locals revel in finding ingenious ways to smuggle in their own libations, rather than pay the inflated prices inside Churchill Downs. Most every school and quite a few businesses in the Kentuckiana region treat the Oaks as a holiday. Perhaps out of self-consciousness for the gambling aspect of the race, none of the region's schools declare that the holiday is explicitly because of the Oaks and most simply say it is an \"administrative holiday.\"\n\n==Changes in distance==\nThe Kentucky Oaks has been run at four different distances:\n\n*1875\u20131890, the race was {{frac|1|1|2}} miles;\n*1891\u20131895, it was {{frac|1|1|4}} miles;\n*1896\u20131919, it was {{frac|1|1|16}} miles;\n*1920\u20131941, changed to {{frac|1|1|8}} miles;\n*1942\u20131981, run at {{frac|1|1|16}} miles; and\n*1982, set at {{frac|1|1|8}} miles, and it has been that distance since.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Records==\n\n;Speed record\n*{{frac|1|1|8}} mile 1:48.64 [[Bird Town]]    2003. \n*{{frac|1|1|2}} mile 2:39 [[Felicia (horse)|Felicia]]  1877, [[Belle of Nelson]]  1878 and  [[Katie Creel]] 1882. \n*{{frac|1|1|4}} mile 2:15 [[Selika]]  1894. \n*{{frac|1|1|16}} mile 1:43.6 [[Ari's Mona]] 1950 and [[Sweet Alliance]]  1977.<ref name=history/>\n\n;Largest winning margin\n*{{frac|20|1|4}} lengths  \u2013 [[Rachel Alexandra]] (2009)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4123946|title=Rachel Alexandra Kentucky Oaks Churchill Downs Kentucky Derby|author=David Grening|website=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Longest shot to win the Oaks\n*47/1 \u2013 [[Lemons Forever]] (2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/harness-racing-entries-and-results-1880376|title=2006 Kentucky Oaks Results|author=Cindy Pierson Dulay|work=About.com Sports|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Most wins by a [[jockey]]\n*4 \u2013 [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1951, 1952, 1953, 1958)\n*4 \u2013 [[Manuel Ycaza]] (1959, 1960, 1963, 1968)\n\n;Female jockeys to win\n*[[Rosie Napravnik]] (2012, 2014)\n\n;Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]\n\n*5 \u2013 [[Woody Stephens]] (1959, 1960, 1963, 1978, 1981)\n\n;Most wins by an owner\n*6 \u2013 [[Calumet Farm]] (1943, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1979)\n\n;Only brothers to both win the Kentucky Oaks\n*[[Carl Ganz|Carl Seay Goose \"Ganz\"]] (1913) \u2013 [[Roscoe Goose|Roscoe Tarleton Goose]] (1916)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brennancallan.com/fam1.html#Roscoe|title=Family Members of Mine|publisher=Brennancallan.com|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref> \nCarl used the original German spelling of \"Goose,\" which one of a few spellings was \"Ganz,\" but also Gantz, Gans, and so on.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brennancallan.com/fam1.html#Carl|title=Family Members of Mine|publisher=Brennancallan.com|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\nThe Goose brothers are cousins of [[Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.]], the founder of the [[Louisville Jockey Club]].\n\n==Winners==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:45px;\"|Year<br>\n!style=\"width:120px;\"|Winner<br>\n!style=\"width:125px;\"|Jockey<br>\n!style=\"width:130px;\"|Trainer<br>\n!style=\"width:215px;\"|Owner<br>\n!style=\"width:50px;\"|Distance<br>(Miles)<br>\n!style=\"width:55px;\"|Time<br>\n!style=\"width:45px;\"|Grade\n|-\n|align=center|2019\n|[[Serengeti Empress]]\n|[[Jose_Ortiz_(jockey)|Jose Ortiz]]\n|[[Thomas_M._Amoss|Tom Amoss]]\n|Joel Politi\n|align=center|{{Frac|1|1|8}}\n|align=center|1:50.17\n|align=center|'''I'''\n|-\n|align=center|2018\n|[[Monomoy Girl]]\n|[[Florent Geroux]]\n|[[Brad H.

The race currently covers {{convert|1+1/8|mi|m}} at [[Churchill Downs]]; the horses carry {{convert|121|lb|kg}}. The Kentucky Oaks is held on the Friday before the [[Kentucky Derby]] each year. The winner gets $750,000 of the $1,250,000 purse and a large garland of [[Lilium|lilies]], affectionately called the \"Lillies for the Fillies.\" A silver [[Kentucky Oaks Trophy]] is presented to the winner.\n\n==History==\nThe first running of the Kentucky Oaks was on May 19, 1875, when Churchill Downs was known as the [[Louisville Jockey Club]].<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/kentucky_oaks/oaks_history/|title=Kentucky Oaks History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205195626/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2002/kentucky_oaks/oaks_history/|archivedate=December 5, 2007}}</ref> The race was founded by [[Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.]] along with the [[Kentucky Derby]], the [[Clark Handicap]], and the [[Falls City Handicap]].<ref name=\"derby\">John E. Kleber, ''The Encyclopedia of Louisville'', Louisville, KY: University Press of Kentucky, p. 467 {{ISBN|0-8131-2100-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Oaks and the Derby are the oldest continuously contested sporting events in American history.<ref name=\"derby\"/> The Kentucky Oaks was modeled after the British [[Epsom Oaks]] which has been run annually at [[Epsom Downs]], [[Epsom]] in Surrey since 1779. In the first race, the horse [[Vinaigrette (horse)|Vinaigrette]] won the then {{frac|1|1|2}} mile race in a time of 2:{{frac|39|3|4}}, winning a purse of $1,175. Since that race the Kentucky Oaks has been held each year.\n\nThe Kentucky Oaks is considered by some to be among the most popular horse races in American horse-racing society due to its high attendance. It has attracted about 100,000 people in attendance each year since 2001's 127th running of the Kentucky Oaks.<ref>Bob Chip Nold, ''Insiders' Guide to Louisville, Kentucky & Southern Indiana, 2nd edition'', Globe Pequot, p. 175 {{ISBN|1-57380-043-0}}</ref> In 1980, attendance reached about 50,000 people and by 1989, it had increased to about 67,000.<ref name=history/> The attendance at the Kentucky Oaks ranks third in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the [[Belmont Stakes]] and the [[Breeders' Cup]]. The attendance of the Kentucky Oaks typically only trails the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes]], for more information see [[American Thoroughbred Racing top Attended Events]].\n\nThe Kentucky Oaks, the [[Black-Eyed Susan Stakes]], and the [[Acorn Stakes]] are the counterparts to the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]], held at [[Churchill Downs]], [[Pimlico Race Course]] and [[Belmont Park]], respectively. The \"Filly Triple Crown\", known as the [[Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing]], is a series of three races at the Belmont Park and [[Saratoga Race Course]]. The [[National Thoroughbred Racing Association]] (NTRA) has considered changing the Triple Tiara series to the three counterparts of the Triple Crown.\n\n==In local culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nDespite the increasing number of out-of-state visitors who attend the race every year, the \"Oaks\" (as local residents simply refer to it) is considered to be a local event by the people of [[Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area|Kentuckiana]] (the [[Ohio Valley]], centered around Louisville, and consisting of much of northern Kentucky and southern [[Indiana]]). Large crowds of Louisvillians and others from the Kentuckiana attend the Oaks annually and the infield of the race track hosts numerous musical attractions, boardwalk games, and food and alcoholic beverage vendors. Bringing in one's own alcohol is forbidden at Churchill Downs and many locals revel in finding ingenious ways to smuggle in their own libations, rather than pay the inflated prices inside Churchill Downs. Most every school and quite a few businesses in the Kentuckiana region treat the Oaks as a holiday. Perhaps out of self-consciousness for the gambling aspect of the race, none of the region's schools declare that the holiday is explicitly because of the Oaks and most simply say it is an \"administrative holiday.\"\n\n==Changes in distance==\nThe Kentucky Oaks has been run at four different distances:\n\n*1875\u20131890, the race was {{frac|1|1|2}} miles;\n*1891\u20131895, it was {{frac|1|1|4}} miles;\n*1896\u20131919, it was {{frac|1|1|16}} miles;\n*1920\u20131941, changed to {{frac|1|1|8}} miles;\n*1942\u20131981, run at {{frac|1|1|16}} miles; and\n*1982, set at {{frac|1|1|8}} miles, and it has been that distance since.<ref name=history/>\n\n==Records==\n\n;Speed record\n*{{frac|1|1|8}} mile 1:48.64 [[Bird Town]]    2003. \n*{{frac|1|1|2}} mile 2:39 [[Felicia (horse)|Felicia]]  1877, [[Belle of Nelson]]  1878 and  [[Katie Creel]] 1882. \n*{{frac|1|1|4}} mile 2:15 [[Selika]]  1894. \n*{{frac|1|1|16}} mile 1:43.6 [[Ari's Mona]] 1950 and [[Sweet Alliance]]  1977.<ref name=history/>\n\n;Largest winning margin\n*{{frac|20|1|4}} lengths  \u2013 [[Rachel Alexandra]] (2009)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4123946|title=Rachel Alexandra Kentucky Oaks Churchill Downs Kentucky Derby|author=David Grening|website=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Longest shot to win the Oaks\n*47/1 \u2013 [[Lemons Forever]] (2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/harness-racing-entries-and-results-1880376|title=2006 Kentucky Oaks Results|author=Cindy Pierson Dulay|work=About.com Sports|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n;Most wins by a [[jockey]]\n*4 \u2013 [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1951, 1952, 1953, 1958)\n*4 \u2013 [[Manuel Ycaza]] (1959, 1960, 1963, 1968)\n\n;Female jockeys to win\n*[[Rosie Napravnik]] (2012, 2014)\n\n;Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]\n\n*5 \u2013 [[Woody Stephens]] (1959, 1960, 1963, 1978, 1981)\n\n;Most wins by an owner\n*6 \u2013 [[Calumet Farm]] (1943, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1979)\n\n;Only brothers to both win the Kentucky Oaks\n*[[Carl Ganz|Carl Seay Goose \"Ganz\"]] (1913) \u2013 [[Roscoe Goose|Roscoe Tarleton Goose]] (1916)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brennancallan.com/fam1.html#Roscoe|title=Family Members of Mine|publisher=Brennancallan.com|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref> \nCarl used the original German spelling of \"Goose,\" which one of a few spellings was \"Ganz,\" but also Gantz, Gans, and so on.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brennancallan.com/fam1.html#Carl|title=Family Members of Mine|publisher=Brennancallan.com|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>\nThe Goose brothers are cousins of [[Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.]], the founder of the [[Louisville Jockey Club]].\n\n==Winners==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:45px;\"|Year<br>\n!style=\"width:120px;\"|Winner<br>\n!style=\"width:125px;\"|Jockey<br>\n!style=\"width:130px;\"|Trainer<br>\n!style=\"width:215px;\"|Owner<br>\n!style=\"width:50px;\"|Distance<br>(Miles)<br>\n!style=\"width:55px;\"|Time<br>\n!style=\"width:45px;\"|Grade\n|-\n|align=center|2019\n|[[Serengeti Empress]]\n|[[Jose_Ortiz_(jockey)|Jose Ortiz]]\n|[[Thomas_M._Amoss|Tom Amoss]]\n|Joel Politi\n|align=center|{{Frac|1|1|8}}\n|align=center|1:50.17\n|align=center|'''I'''\n|-\n|align=center|2018\n|[[Monomoy Girl]]\n|[[Florent Geroux]]\n|[[Brad H.

He came to Arizona Territory in 1866 as a U.S. Indian Agent. Recognizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he found an easily fordable crossing on the Gila River and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of Governor R.C. McCormick, he secured a post office in August of the same year. Ruggles held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=26709 Levi Ruggles, Founder of Florence]</ref> Florence became the county seat in the newly formed Pinal County. Silver was discovered in 1875 in the nearby mountains which led to the creation of the famous Silver King Mine.<ref name=\"AF\">[http://www.visitflorenceaz.com/aboutflorence.shtml About Florence]</ref>\n\n===Adamsville===\nIn 1870, Fred Adams founded a farming community two miles west of the original Florence townsite. The farming town had stores, homes, a post office, a flour mill, and water tanks, It was named Adamsville. In the 1900s (decade), the [[Gila River]] overflowed after a storm and ran over its banks. Most of the small town was wiped out and the residents moved to Florence. The area where the town was established is now a [[ghost town]] and is currently within the boundaries of Florence. At the junction of Highway 79 and 287 there is a historical marker about Adamsville.<ref>[http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/az/adamsville.html Ghost towns]</ref>\n\nA canal was built in the 1880s which enabled water from the Gila River to be diverted for irrigation. Farming and ranching then played a major role in Florence\u2019s economy. All of the federal land transactions for Southern Arizona were conducted in Florence until 1881, when the [[Federal Land Office]] was moved to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n\n===Tunnel Saloon Gabriel-Phy shootout of 1888===\nOne of the most notable gunfights in the Old Southwest occurred in Florence. Sheriff Pete Gabriel hired thirty-nine year old Joseph (Joe) Phy as his deputy in 1883. Gabriel decided to not run for sheriff in 1886 and supported his deputy Phy for the job. Later Gabriel withdrew his support because of personal differences with Phy. The two friends became bitter enemies and had a confrontation on May 31, 1888 in the Tunnel Saloon. A gunfight ensued and spread to the street. Both men received gunshot wounds. Phy died a few hours after the gunfight, but Gabriel survived the encounter and died 10 years later.<ref>[http://www.guns.com/2011/07/29/gunfights-on-gunscom-shootout-at-the-tunnel-saloon/ Shootout at the Tunnel Saloon]</ref>\n\n===Second Pinal County Courthouse===\nThe second Pinal County Courthouse was built in 1891. It was the site where the trials of three notorious women were presented. They were [[Pearl Heart]], [[Eva Dugan]] and [[Winnie Ruth Judd]], known as the \"Trunk Murderess\". Pearl Heart (birth surname: Hart) was an [[outlaw]] of the [[American Old West]]. She committed one of the last recorded [[stagecoach]] [[robbery|robberies]] in the United States; her crime gained notoriety primarily because of her gender. She was tried in 1899 and was acquitted, however the judge ordered a second trial and she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.<ref>{{cite news | title = Pearl Hart Acquitted | page = 9 |work=New York Times | date = November 17, 1899| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A01E1DB1530E132A25754C1A9679D94689ED7CF }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Eva Dugan was convicted of murder.

The jury found her guilty of first-degree murder on February 8, 1932. An appeal was unsuccessful. Her trial was marked by sensationalized newspaper coverage and suspicious circumstances. Judd was sentenced to be hanged February 17, 1933, and sent to the Arizona State Prison in Florence. The sentence she received raised debate about capital punishment.<ref name= NYT_1998-10-27>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/27/us/winnie-r-judd-93-infamous-as-1930-s-trunk-murderess.html\n|title=Winnie R.

He came to Arizona Territory in 1866 as a U.S. Indian Agent. Recognizing the agricultural potential of the valley, he found an easily fordable crossing on the Gila River and surveyed a townsite there. With the aid of Governor R.C. McCormick, he secured a post office in August of the same year. Ruggles held numerous public offices including that of Territorial Legislator.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=26709 Levi Ruggles, Founder of Florence]</ref> Florence became the county seat in the newly formed Pinal County.

The farming town had stores, homes, a post office, a flour mill, and water tanks, It was named Adamsville. In the 1900s (decade), the [[Gila River]] overflowed after a storm and ran over its banks. Most of the small town was wiped out and the residents moved to Florence. The area where the town was established is now a [[ghost town]] and is currently within the boundaries of Florence. At the junction of Highway 79 and 287 there is a historical marker about Adamsville.<ref>[http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/az/adamsville.html Ghost towns]</ref>\n\nA canal was built in the 1880s which enabled water from the Gila River to be diverted for irrigation. Farming and ranching then played a major role in Florence\u2019s economy. All of the federal land transactions for Southern Arizona were conducted in Florence until 1881, when the [[Federal Land Office]] was moved to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n\n===Tunnel Saloon Gabriel-Phy shootout of 1888===\nOne of the most notable gunfights in the Old Southwest occurred in Florence. Sheriff Pete Gabriel hired thirty-nine year old Joseph (Joe) Phy as his deputy in 1883. Gabriel decided to not run for sheriff in 1886 and supported his deputy Phy for the job. Later Gabriel withdrew his support because of personal differences with Phy. The two friends became bitter enemies and had a confrontation on May 31, 1888 in the Tunnel Saloon. A gunfight ensued and spread to the street. Both men received gunshot wounds.

It was the site where the trials of three notorious women were presented. They were [[Pearl Heart]], [[Eva Dugan]] and [[Winnie Ruth Judd]], known as the \"Trunk Murderess\". Pearl Heart (birth surname: Hart) was an [[outlaw]] of the [[American Old West]]. She committed one of the last recorded [[stagecoach]] [[robbery|robberies]] in the United States; her crime gained notoriety primarily because of her gender. She was tried in 1899 and was acquitted, however the judge ordered a second trial and she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.<ref>{{cite news | title = Pearl Hart Acquitted | page = 9 |work=New York Times | date = November 17, 1899| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A01E1DB1530E132A25754C1A9679D94689ED7CF }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Eva Dugan was convicted of murder. She was sentenced to be executed by [[hanging]].

The jury found her guilty of first-degree murder on February 8, 1932. An appeal was unsuccessful. Her trial was marked by sensationalized newspaper coverage and suspicious circumstances. Judd was sentenced to be hanged February 17, 1933, and sent to the Arizona State Prison in Florence. The sentence she received raised debate about capital punishment.<ref name= NYT_1998-10-27>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/27/us/winnie-r-judd-93-infamous-as-1930-s-trunk-murderess.html\n|title=Winnie R.
