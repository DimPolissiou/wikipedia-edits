The ship was particularly important to Southern California ports, where she called for roughly the last 20 years of her service.\n\n== Construction ==\n''Orizaba'' was built by [[Jacob Aaron Westervelt|Jacob A.

The ship's business was managed by a partnership formed by his son-in-law and his youngest son, Israel Harris and Henry Morgan.  ''Orizaba's'' inaugural trip was from [[New York City|New York]] to [[New Orleans]].  She departed on April 22, 1854.

The only existing sea route from the East Coast to California was through [[Panama]].  It was an effective monopoly with the [[U.S. Mail Steamship Company]] running to the Atlantic side of the isthmus, and the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] running from Panama to [[San Francisco]].  The monopoly kept rates high, so [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] pioneered a new route from New York to San Francisco across [[Nicaragua]], at least 500 miles shorter than the route across Panama.  His ocean-going steamships sailed from New York to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of Nicaragua, and from the Pacific Coast to San Francisco.  He planned a canal to connect the two oceans, but in the short-term transferred passengers from one coast to the other by shallow-draft river steamer, stagecoach, and mule train.  The Nicaraguan government granted the [[Accessory Transit Company]], controlled by Vanderbilt, the right to build a canal and pending its construction, a monopoly on transporting passengers across the country.  Charles Morgan was the company's New York manager.  The business, if not the canal was a success, and in one year 24,000 passengers traveled the route.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Scroggs|first=William Oscar|date=1905|title=William Walker and the Steamship Corporation in Nicaragua|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=10|issue=4|pages=792\u2013811|doi=10.2307/1834476|issn=0002-8762|jstor=1834476}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Vanderbilt, Nicaragua was politically unstable, and some of his partners, including Morgan and [[C.

The only existing sea route from the East Coast to California was through [[Panama]].  It was an effective monopoly with the [[U.S. Mail Steamship Company]] running to the Atlantic side of the isthmus, and the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] running from Panama to [[San Francisco]].  The monopoly kept rates high, so [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] pioneered a new route from New York to San Francisco across [[Nicaragua]], at least 500 miles shorter than the route across Panama.  His ocean-going steamships sailed from New York to the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of Nicaragua, and from the Pacific Coast to San Francisco.  He planned a canal to connect the two oceans, but in the short-term transferred passengers from one coast to the other by shallow-draft river steamer, stagecoach, and mule train.

Thirty states have a coastline: twenty-three with a coastline on the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] (including the [[Gulf of Mexico]]), and/or [[Pacific Ocean]], and eight with a [[Great Lakes]] shoreline. [[New York (state)|New York]] has coasts on both the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Smaller border lakes such as [[Lake Champlain]] or [[Lake of the Woods]] are not counted. The five major [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] have coastlines \u2014 three of them have a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, and two of them have a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean ([[Caribbean Sea]]). The [[United States Minor Outlying Islands|U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]] also have coastlines.\n\nTwo separate measurements are used: method 1 only includes states with ocean coastline and excludes tidal inlets; method 2 includes [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]] shoreline and the extra length from tidal inlets. For example, method 2 counts the [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay]] as part of [[New Hampshire]]'s coastline, but method 1 does not. \n\nMethod 1 does not include the coastlines of the [[Territories of the United States|territories of the United States]], while method 2 does.\n\nThe data for method 1 was retrieved from a [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] Report for [[United States Congress|Congress]]<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21729.pdf \"U.S. International Borders: Brief Facts\"], [[Congressional Research Service]], November 9, 2006</ref> using data from ''U.S. [[Department of Commerce]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], The Coastline of the [[United States]], 1975''.<ref name=\"Administration1975\">{{cite book|author=United States.

The figure for Connecticut was arrived at separately and may not reflect the correct comparative distance. These numbers exclude the Great Lakes coastlines.\n\nThe data for method 2 is from a list maintained by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).{{refn|group=note|The data for the [[U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]] is from the [[CIA World Factbook]].}}  The state coastline lengths were computed by an unspecified method that includes tidal areas not included in the first method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/mystate/|title=NOAA Office for Coastal Management {{!}} States and Territories Working on Ocean and Coastal Management|date=14 October 2016|website=coast.noaa.gov|publisher=NOAA Office for Coastal Management|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> These numbers also include the Great Lakes coastlines, which do not have similar tidal areas.

Thirty states have a coastline: twenty-three with a coastline on the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] (including the [[Gulf of Mexico]]), and/or [[Pacific Ocean]], and eight with a [[Great Lakes]] shoreline. [[New York (state)|New York]] has coasts on both the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Smaller border lakes such as [[Lake Champlain]] or [[Lake of the Woods]] are not counted. The five major [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] have coastlines \u2014 three of them have a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, and two of them have a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean ([[Caribbean Sea]]). The [[United States Minor Outlying Islands|U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]] also have coastlines.\n\nTwo separate measurements are used: method 1 only includes states with ocean coastline and excludes tidal inlets; method 2 includes [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]] shoreline and the extra length from tidal inlets. For example, method 2 counts the [[Great Bay (New Hampshire)|Great Bay]] as part of [[New Hampshire]]'s coastline, but method 1 does not. \n\nMethod 1 does not include the coastlines of the [[Territories of the United States|territories of the United States]], while method 2 does.\n\nThe data for method 1 was retrieved from a [[Congressional Research Service|CRS]] Report for [[United States Congress|Congress]]<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21729.pdf \"U.S. International Borders: Brief Facts\"], [[Congressional Research Service]], November 9, 2006</ref> using data from ''U.S. [[Department of Commerce]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], The Coastline of the [[United States]], 1975''.<ref name=\"Administration1975\">{{cite book|author=United States.

The figure for Connecticut was arrived at separately and may not reflect the correct comparative distance. These numbers exclude the Great Lakes coastlines.\n\nThe data for method 2 is from a list maintained by the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).{{refn|group=note|The data for the [[U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]] is from the [[CIA World Factbook]].}}  The state coastline lengths were computed by an unspecified method that includes tidal areas not included in the first method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/mystate/|title=NOAA Office for Coastal Management {{!}} States and Territories Working on Ocean and Coastal Management|date=14 October 2016|website=coast.noaa.gov|publisher=NOAA Office for Coastal Management|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> These numbers also include the Great Lakes coastlines, which do not have similar tidal areas.

Ten years later he was prosecuted again by the prosecutors of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. On October 19, 2010 the S\u00e3o Paulo Justice Court (TJ-SP) annulled all accusations made by the S\u00e3o Paulo Public Ministry against the UCKG and its principal representatives by a majority vote. The judges deemed that the S\u00e3o Paulo prosecutors did not have jurisdiction to investigate the case, as the accusations were of a type that fell into the federal jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.universopolitico.com/exibir.php?noticia=7805 Universo Politico: Accusations against UCKG recognised as illegal, 24 October 2010] {{in lang|pt}}</ref>\n\n==Companies==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}\nMacedo also leads [[Rede Record]]<ref name=istoe/> (the second biggest television network in Brazil), [[Rede Fam\u00edlia]], [[Record News]], [[Line Records]], 64 radio stations of [[Rede Aleluia]] and [[Universal Produ\u00e7\u00f5es]].\n\n==Books==\nTen million copies of evangelical books by Macedo have been sold, and over 34 titles published. Titles include ''Orix\u00e1s, Caboclos and Guias'' and ''In the Footsteps of Jesus'', both of which sold more than three million copies in Brazil. He has also sold his trilogy called ''Nada a perder'' (''Nothing to lose''), with millions of copies sold worldwide. He has written several religious books including the polemical best-seller ''Orix\u00e1s, Caboclos e Guias, Deuses ou Dem\u00f4nios''.\n\n==Movies==\nHis broadcasting company Record financed the 2018 movie ''Nada a perder'' (''[[Nothing to lose (2018)|Nothing to Lose]]'') about Edir Macedo's life, which is based on his autobiography.

Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio, graphics and a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called [[integrated software]] include several applications.<ref>Ceruzzi, Paul E. (2000). ''A History of Modern Computing''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-03255-4}}.</ref>\n\n[[End-user development|User-written software]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software includes spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, audio, graphics, and animation scripts. Even [[Email filtering|email filters]] are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.\n\nThe delineation between system software such as [[operating system]]s and application software is not exact, however, and is occasionally the object of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=William|title=Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality|url=https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871|publisher=Cutter Consortium}}</ref>  For example, one of the key questions in the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' [[antitrust]] trial was whether Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]] [[web browser]] was part of its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system or a separable piece of application software.  As another example, the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the [[Linux kernel]] and the operating systems built over this [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]]. In some types of [[embedded system]]s, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user, as in the case of software used to control a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], [[DVD]] player or [[microwave oven]]. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app: '' see [[Application portfolio management#Definition of an application|Application Portfolio Management]].''\n\n===Metonymy===\nThe word \"application\" used as an adjective is not restricted to the \"of or pertaining to application software\" meaning.<ref>[https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871 Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality]</ref> For example, concepts such as [[application programming interface]] (API), [[application server]], [[application virtualization]], [[application lifecycle management]] and [[portable application]] apply to all computer programs alike, not just application software.\n\n===Apps and killer apps===\n{{Main|Killer application}}\n\nSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others only work on one and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|geography]] application ''for [[Microsoft Windows]]'', or an ''[[Android (operating system)|Android]]'' application for [[Educational software|education]], or a [[Linux gaming|''Linux'' game]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one [[Computing platform|platform]], increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]] or ''killer app''. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern [[spreadsheet]] software for the Apple II and helped selling the then-new [[personal computer]]s into offices. For Blackberry it was their [[email]] software.\n\nIn recent years, the shortened term \"app\" (coined in 1981 or earlier<ref>[http://www.osnews.com/story/24882/The_History_of_App_and_the_Demise_of_the_Programmer The History of 'App' and the Demise of the Programmer]</ref>) has become popular to refer to [[Mobile app|applications for mobile devices]] such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on PCs. Even more recently, the shortened version is used for desktop application software as well.\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are many different and alternative ways in order to classify  application software.\n\nBy the legal point of view, application software is mainly classified with a [[black box|black box approach]], in relation to the rights of its final [[end-users]] or [[subscribers]] (with eventual intermediate and tiered subscription levels).\n\nSoftware applications are also classified in respect of the programming language in which the source code is written or executed, and respect of their purpose and outputs.\n\n=== By property and use rights ===\nApplication software is usually distinguished among two main classes: closed source vs [[open source software]] applications, and among [[free software|free]] or [[proprietary software]] applications.\n\nProprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright, and a [[software license]] grants limited usage rights. The [[open-closed principle]] states that software may be \"open only for extension, but not for modification\". Such applications can only get [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on]] by third-parties.\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] shall be run, distributed, sold or extended for any purpose, and -being open- shall be modified or [[reverse engineering|reversed]] in the same way.\n\nFOSS software applications released under a [[free license]] may be [[List of countries' copyright lengths|perpetual]] and also [[royalty-free]].

Depending on the activity for which it was designed, an application can manipulate text, numbers, audio, graphics and a combination of these elements. Some application packages focus on a single task, such as word processing; others, called [[integrated software]] include several applications.<ref>Ceruzzi, Paul E. (2000). ''A History of Modern Computing''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-03255-4}}.</ref>\n\n[[End-user development|User-written software]] tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software includes spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, audio, graphics, and animation scripts. Even [[Email filtering|email filters]] are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.\n\nThe delineation between system software such as [[operating system]]s and application software is not exact, however, and is occasionally the object of controversy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulrich|first1=William|title=Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality|url=https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871|publisher=Cutter Consortium}}</ref>  For example, one of the key questions in the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' [[antitrust]] trial was whether Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]] [[web browser]] was part of its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system or a separable piece of application software.  As another example, the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]] is, in part, due to disagreement about the relationship between the [[Linux kernel]] and the operating systems built over this [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]]. In some types of [[embedded system]]s, the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user, as in the case of software used to control a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], [[DVD]] player or [[microwave oven]]. The above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations. For an alternative definition of an app: '' see [[Application portfolio management#Definition of an application|Application Portfolio Management]].''\n\n===Metonymy===\nThe word \"application\" used as an adjective is not restricted to the \"of or pertaining to application software\" meaning.<ref>[https://www.cutter.com/article/application-package-software-promise-vs-reality-393871 Application Package Software: The Promise Vs. Reality]</ref> For example, concepts such as [[application programming interface]] (API), [[application server]], [[application virtualization]], [[application lifecycle management]] and [[portable application]] apply to all computer programs alike, not just application software.\n\n===Apps and killer apps===\n{{Main|Killer application}}\n\nSome applications are available in versions for several different platforms; others only work on one and are thus called, for example, a [[Geographic information system|geography]] application ''for [[Microsoft Windows]]'', or an ''[[Android (operating system)|Android]]'' application for [[Educational software|education]], or a [[Linux gaming|''Linux'' game]].  Sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one [[Computing platform|platform]], increasing the desirability of that platform.  This is called a [[killer application]] or ''killer app''. For example, VisiCalc was the first modern [[spreadsheet]] software for the Apple II and helped selling the then-new [[personal computer]]s into offices. For Blackberry it was their [[email]] software.\n\nIn recent years, the shortened term \"app\" (coined in 1981 or earlier<ref>[http://www.osnews.com/story/24882/The_History_of_App_and_the_Demise_of_the_Programmer The History of 'App' and the Demise of the Programmer]</ref>) has become popular to refer to [[Mobile app|applications for mobile devices]] such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]], the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on PCs. Even more recently, the shortened version is used for desktop application software as well.\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are many different and alternative ways in order to classify  application software.\n\nBy the legal point of view, application software is mainly classified with a [[black box|black box approach]], in relation to the rights of its final [[end-users]] or [[subscribers]] (with eventual intermediate and tiered subscription levels).\n\nSoftware applications are also classified in respect of the programming language in which the source code is written or executed, and respect of their purpose and outputs.\n\n=== By property and use rights ===\nApplication software is usually distinguished among two main classes: closed source vs [[open source software]] applications, and among [[free software|free]] or [[proprietary software]] applications.\n\nProprietary software is placed under the exclusive copyright, and a [[software license]] grants limited usage rights. The [[open-closed principle]] states that software may be \"open only for extension, but not for modification\". Such applications can only get [[Plug-in (computing)|add-on]] by third-parties.\n\n[[Free and open-source software]] shall be run, distributed, sold or extended for any purpose, and -being open- shall be modified or [[reverse engineering|reversed]] in the same way.\n\nFOSS software applications released under a [[free license]] may be [[List of countries' copyright lengths|perpetual]] and also [[royalty-free]]. Perhaps, the [[ownership|owner]], the [[holder (law)|holder]] or third-party [[law enforcer|enforcer]] of any right ([[copyright]], [[trademark]], [[patent]], or ''[[ius in re|ius in re aliena]]'') are entitled to add exceptions, limitations, time decays or expiring dates to the license terms of use.\n\n[[Public-domain software]] is a type of FOSS, which is royalty-free and - openly or reservedly- can be run, distributed, modified, reversed, republished or created in derivative works without any [[attribution (copyright)|copyright attribution]] and therefore [[revocation]]. It can even be sold, but without transferring the public domain property to other single subjects. Public-domain SW can be released under an (un)licens\ning legal statement, which enforces those terms and conditions for an indefinite duration (for a lifetime, or forever).\n\n=== By coding language ===\nSince the development and near-universal adoption of the [[World Wide Web|web]], an important distinction that has emerged, has been between [[web application]]s &mdash; written with [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]] and other web-native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a [[web browser]], and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for one's particular type of computer.

By cooperating with Wernike, Foerster's great interest on the [[anatomy]] of the [[central nervous system]] was excited.  The two researchers published together in 1903 an anatomical atlas of the brain (''Atlas des Gehirns'').

From this work arose his theoretical interest on the disturbances of [[motor coordination]] in the execution of movements: this resulted in the topic of his dissertation in 1902, a work which attained a great actuality in connection with the systematic introduction of [[rehabilitation medicine]] into neurology.  The involvement of [[spinal reflex]]es in the genesis of muscular [[spasticity]] suggested its possible treatment by surgical interruption of the sensory branch of the thoracic and lumbar nerves ([[rhizotomy]]), and Foerster developed in 1908 an operation to cut the posterior sensory root in order to alleviate spasticity.\n\nIn 1915 Foerster first reported on his innovative results concerning the [[neurosurgery|surgical treatment]] of [[nerve damage]] by shot [[wound]]s, as well as other kinds of [[spinal cord]] and [[brain]] damage.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1924 Foerster went to Russia as he attended [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] after his stroke.<ref name=\":2\" /> When his most famous patient died, he was asked to suggest a scientist who could examine Lenin\u2019s brain after the autopsy.

His name has been honoured by the German Society of Neurosurgery by the ''Otfrid-Foerster-Medaille und -Ged\u00e4chtnisvorlesung'' (Otfrid Foerster Medal and Memorial Lecture), created on August 26, 1953.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Physiologie und Pathologie der Coordination'', Jena 1902\n* ''Atlas des Gehirns'', herausgegeben von Karl Wernicke, Berlin 1903\n* ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Hirnchirurgie'', Berlin 1909\n* ''Die Kontrakturen bei den Erkrankungen der Pyramidenbahn'', Berlin 1909\n* ''\u00dcber die operative Behandlung spastischer L\u00e4hmungen mittels Resektion der hinteren R\u00fcckenmarksw\u00fcrzel'', Berlin 1911\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Foerster | first1 =  | year = 1911 | title = Resection of the Posterior Spinal Nerve-roots in the Treatment of Gastric Crises and Spastic Paralysis | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 226\u2013246 | pmid = 19975563 | pmc = 2004804 | doi = 10.1177/003591571100401548 }}\n* ''Zur Pathogenese und chirurgische Behandlung der Epilepsie'', Leipzig 1925\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Foerster | first1 = O | year = 1926 | title = Die Pathogenese des epileptischen Krampfanfalles | url = | journal = Deutsche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Nervenheilkunde | volume = 94 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201353 | doi = 10.1007/BF01652996 | lang=de }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Penfield | first1 = Wilder | last2 = Foerster | first2 = Otfrid | year = 1930| title = The structural basis of traumatic epilepsy and results of radical operation | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 99\u2013119 | doi = 10.1093/brain/53.2.99 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Foerster | first1 = O | year = 1933 | title = The dermatomes in man | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1\u201339 | doi = 10.1093/brain/56.1.1 }}\n* ''Der Schmerz und seine operative Behandlung'', Halle 1935\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* Otfrid Foerster 1873\u20131941: An Appreciation.
