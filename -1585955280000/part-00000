Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.<  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years.

Groves High School''' or '''Groves''') is a [[high school]] in [[Beverly Hills, Michigan]], United States, in the [[Birmingham City School District|Birmingham Public School District]].  Groves' colors are green, white, and yellow and its mascot is Freddy the Falcon. The current principal is Dr. Embekka Roberson, and the assistant principals are Othamian Peterson, Delois Spryszak, and Darin Wilcox, and the athletic director is Tom Flynn.\n\nThe [[French School of Detroit]] holds its high school classes at Groves High School.<ref>\"[http://www.frenchschoolofdetroit.org/curriculum/high-school The High School].\" [[French School of Detroit]]. Retrieved on June 20, 2015. \"Location: Groves High School, 20500 13 mile Road, Beverly, MI 48025.\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nIn 1951, a new high school in Birmingham opened under the name Birmingham High School (which is now known as Seaholm High School). At the time, the president of the Board of Education was Ernest W. Seaholm and the treasurer was Wylie E. Groves. When Birmingham had to build another school to accommodate the incoming baby boomers, these men's names would become the source of the modern names of Birmingham's two main high schools: Seaholm High School and Groves High School.\n\n=== Building history ===\nCompleted in 1959, the building was an example of the International Style applied to ordinary school design, resulting in a modernistic exterior look similar to much subsequent school construction. The building's original architectural \"signature\" was a scalloped circular white roof over the circular library; now painted black, it is visible but no longer prominent. The building has a grid-like floor plan, with three main hallways intersected by six shorter ones. Liberal use was made of glass walls and interior courtyards, with energy costs not yet a major concern in 1959. Since the school's opening, the building has undergone periodic renovations, the most extensive occurring from 1999\u20132001 when the school was completely remodeled. The school features state of the art technology, including seven computer labs (including one for modern languages) and a large media center; state of the art science labs for biology, chemistry, physics, CAD, and robotics; a little theatre that seats approximately 300; an auditorium that seats approximately 1200; art studios for drawing, photography, jewelry, ceramics, and graphic design; a TV studio; and a large, open commons area where students gather for lunch, dances, and other activities. In 2005, construction began to renovate the athletic wing of the school, as well as to build a new competitive size swimming pool. The former swimming pool has been converted into classrooms, a fitness center, and a dance studio. The school was one of the first schools in Michigan to use artificial \"[[FieldTurf]]\" for its football/soccer field. In 2017, there was renovations of the auditorium and construction of a scene shop addition.\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe school opened in the fall of 1959 with 1,052 students in grades seven through ten. Intended eventually to be Birmingham's second high school, it was named after a local civic leader and school board member. In the first year, students selected the school colors (green and white), team nickname (Falcons), fight song (\"Rise Up, All Falcons,\" music and lyrics composed by Mr. Burton Bronson, Groves Band Director), names of the yearbook (\"Talon\") and newspaper (\"Scriptor\"), etc. The original tenth graders became the first class of graduating seniors in 1962. For a brief period the school was a junior and senior high school, and the classes of 1965, 1966 and 1967 spent grades seven through twelve there. Beginning with the 1963-64 school year, grades seven and eight were moved from Groves to Berkshire Middle School, which today serves grades six through eight in the Birmingham City School District.<  The lower grades were eliminated as new junior high schools were built. This pattern enabled the school district to accommodate, with phased construction, the demographic wave of babyboomers emerging from elementary schools in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school offers numerous Honors and Advanced Placement courses for students to elect. Advanced Placement is offered for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Computer Science, Economics, English Language, English Literature, Environmental Science, European History, French, Music Theory, Psychology, Spanish, Statistics, US History, and US Government. The school has a variety of academic elective options for students who do not wish to take Honors or AP courses. The school also offers many courses in journalism, with the newspaper- \"The Scriptor\", the yearbook- \"The Talon\", and the television production- \"The Fann (Falcon Action News Network)\"\n\n== Athletics and activities ==\nThe school offers over thirty varsity sports for both men and women.  Most sports are broken down into varsity, junior varsity, and freshmen teams. Groves is a member of the Oakland Activities Association and has won league championships in nearly every sport since the league's inception in 1994. Groves also offers a variety of activities for students to participate in, including instrumental music (both band and orchestra), forensics team, eco club, interact club, fashion club, Amnesty and Animal Rights club, Gay-Straight Alliance club, Japanese club, Spanish club, French club, debate team, theatre, quiz bowl, bowling club, photography club, and the National Honor Society. Both the forensics and debate teams have enjoyed success in recent years. The forensics team finished second in the state in 2007, while the debate team finished first in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nGroves Student Congress (GSC) is responsible for planning school-wide activities and events such as Spirit Week, Field Day, Extreme Dodgeball, Operation Volleyball, Sadie Hawkins Dance, Wylie's Winter Week, and two blood drives.

This formulation only applies to the visible spectrum. Outside this range requires the use of different spectral lines. For non-visible spectral lines the term V-number is more commonly used. The more general formulation defined as,\n\n:<math>V = \\frac{ n_{center} - 1 }{ n_{short} - n_{long} },</math>\n\nwhere ''n''<sub>short</sub>, ''n''<sub>center</sub> and ''n''<sub>long</sub> are the refractive indices of the material at three different wavelengths. The shortest wavelength index is ''n''<sub>short</sub> and the longest is ''n''<sub>long</sub>.\n\nAbbe numbers are used to classify [[glass]] and other optical materials in terms of their chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion [[flint glass]]es have ''V''&nbsp;<&nbsp;55 whereas the lower dispersion [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]es have larger Abbe numbers. Values of ''V'' range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for [[polycarbonate]] plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses. \n\n[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|Most of the human eye's wavelength sensitivity curve, shown here, is bracketted by the Abbe number reference wavelengths of 486.1&nbsp;nm (blue) and 656.3&nbsp;nm (red)]]Abbe numbers are used in the design of [[achromatic lens]]es, as their ''reciprocal'' is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph).
