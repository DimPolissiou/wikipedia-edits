From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90\u00b0 to right of wind direction in the northern hemisphere (left in the southern hemisphere). Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below.<ref>Mann & Lazier p 172</ref> In shallow coastal waters, the Ekman spiral is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.<ref>Colling p 43</ref>\n* Ekman transport is similarly at work in [[Upwelling#Equatorial|equatorial upwelling]], where, in both hemispheres, a [[trade wind]] component towards the west causes a net transport of water towards the pole, and a trade wind component towards the east causes a net transport of water away from the pole.<ref name=Knauss125/>\n* On smaller scales, [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] winds induce Ekman transport which causes net divergence and upwelling, or Ekman suction,<ref name=Knauss125/> while [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] winds cause net convergence and downwelling, or Ekman pumping<ref name=P&P295>Pond & Pickard p 295</ref>\n* Ekman transport is also a factor in the circulation of the [[ocean gyre]]s.

In the turbulent atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer it is a strong function of depth);\n* the wind forcing is steady and has been blowing for a long time;\n* [[barotropic]] conditions with no geostrophic flow;\n* the [[Coriolis parameter]], <math> f\\,\\!</math> is kept constant.\n\nThe simplified equations for the Coriolis force in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions follow from these assumptions:\n\n:{{EquationRef|1|(1)}}{{pad|2em}} <math>\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial z} = -fv,\\,</math>\n:{{EquationRef|2|(2)}}{{pad|2em}} <math>\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial z} = fu,\\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tau\\,\\!</math> is the wind stress, <math>\\rho\\,\\!</math> is the density, <math>u\\,\\!</math> is the east\u2013west velocity, and <math>v\\,\\!</math> is the north\u2013south velocity.\n\nIntegrating each equation over the entire Ekman layer:\n\n:<math>\\tau_x=-M_yf,\\,</math>\n:<math>\\tau_y=M_xf,\\,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>M_x=\\int^z_0 \\rho u dz,\\,</math>\n:<math>M_y=\\int^z_0 \\rho v dz.\\,</math>\n\nHere <math>M_x\\,\\!</math> and <math>M_y\\,\\!</math> represent the zonal and meridional mass transport terms with units of mass per unit time per unit length. Contrarily to common logic, north\u2013south winds cause mass transport in the east\u2013west direction.<ref>Knauss p. 123</ref>\n\nIn order to understand the vertical velocity structure of the water column, equations {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can be rewritten in terms of the vertical eddy viscosity term.\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial z} = \\rho A_z \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2},\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial z} = \\rho A_z \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2},\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>A_z\\,\\!</math> is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient.\n\nThis gives a set of differential equations of the form\n\n:<math> A_z \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}=-fv,\\,\\!</math>\n:<math> A_z \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}=fu.\\,\\!</math>\n\nIn order to solve this system of two differential equations, two boundary conditions can be applied:\n* <math>{(u,v) \\to 0}</math> as <math>{z \\to -\\infin},</math>\n* friction is equal to wind stress at the free surface (<math> z=0 \\,\\!</math>).\n\nThings can be further simplified by considering wind blowing in the ''y''-direction only. This means is the results will be relative to a north\u2013south wind (although these solutions could be produced relative to wind in any other direction):<ref name=P&P108>Pond & Pickard p.108</ref>\n\n:{{EquationRef|3|(3)}}{{pad|2em}}<math>\n\\begin{align}\nu_E&=\\pm V_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{D_E}z\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{D_E}z\\right),\\\\\nv_E&= V_0 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\pi}{D_E}z\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{D_E}z\\right),\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* <math> u_E\\,\\!</math> and <math> v_E\\,\\!</math> represent Ekman transport in the ''u'' and ''v'' direction;\n* in equation {{EquationNote|3}} the plus sign applies to the northern hemisphere and the minus sign to the southern hemisphere;\n* <math>V_0= \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi\\tau_{y\\eta}}{D_E\\rho|f|};\\,\\!</math>\n* <math>\\tau_{y\\eta}\\,\\!</math> is the wind stress on the sea surface;\n* <math>D_E = \\pi\\left(\\frac{2A_z}{|f|}\\right)^{1/2}\\,\\!</math> is the Ekman depth (depth of Ekman layer).\n\nBy solving this at ''z''=0, the surface current is found to be (as expected) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the Ekman spiral, both in magnitude and direction.<ref name=P&P108/> Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere.\n\n==Applications==\n* Ekman transport leads to [[Upwelling#Coastal|coastal upwelling]], which provides the nutrient supply for some of the largest fishing markets on the planet<ref name=Knauss125>Knauss p 125</ref> and can impact the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]] by pulling warm deep water onto the continental shelf.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=R.

From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90\u00b0 to right of wind direction in the northern hemisphere (left in the southern hemisphere). Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below.<ref>Mann & Lazier p 172</ref> In shallow coastal waters, the Ekman spiral is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.<ref>Colling p 43</ref>\n* Ekman transport is similarly at work in [[Upwelling#Equatorial|equatorial upwelling]], where, in both hemispheres, a [[trade wind]] component towards the west causes a net transport of water towards the pole, and a trade wind component towards the east causes a net transport of water away from the pole.<ref name=Knauss125/>\n* On smaller scales, [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] winds induce Ekman transport which causes net divergence and upwelling, or Ekman suction,<ref name=Knauss125/> while [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] winds cause net convergence and downwelling, or Ekman pumping<ref name=P&P295>Pond & Pickard p 295</ref>\n* Ekman transport is also a factor in the circulation of the [[ocean gyre]]s. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre in all locations, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating [[Geostrophic wind#geostrophic flow|geostrophic flow]] (Colling p 65). [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for this (see [[Sverdrup balance]]).<ref name=P&P295/> See: [[Garbage Patch (disambiguation)|Garbage Patch]]\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Ekman velocity}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Colling, A., ''Ocean Circulation'', Open University Course Team.

It was in operation between 1798 and 2011. The centre was initially called '''Parramatta Gaol''' until its name was changed to Parramatta Correctional Centre in 1992. When in operation, the centre was managed by [[Corrective Services NSW]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Department of Attorney General and Justice (New South Wales)|Department of Attorney General and Justice]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. Immediately prior to its closure, the centre detained short term [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] and [[Remand (detention)|remand]] inmates, operated as a transient centre, and was the [[Periodic Detention Centre|periodic detention centre]] for metropolitan [[Sydney]].\n\nDesigned by George Barney and [[Mortimer Lewis]], the complex is listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=town%3Dparramatta%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=3090 |title=Parramatta Gaol (former), 73 O'Connell St, North Parramatta, NSW, Australia |work=[[Australian Heritage Database]] |publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy, [[Australian Government]] |date=14 May 1991 |access-date=20 September 2017 }}</ref> and the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] as a site of State significance.<ref name=nswshr-812>{{cite NSW SHR|5000657|Parramatta Correctional Centre|hr=00812|fn=S90/06416; H00/00112|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCorrectional facilities were first established in Parramatta in 1798, being \"a strong logged gaol of 100 feet in length, with separate cells for the prisoners ... and paled around with very high fence\", housing eight prisoners.<ref name=\"SR485\"/> In 1799, a fire destroyed this facility and it was rebuilt in 1802 on the same site (now occupied by [[Riverside Theatre Parramatta|Riverside Theatres]]).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.riversideparramatta.com.au/content/files/142/Coming_Clean_Media_Release.pdf |format=PDF |title=Criminals and Parramatta Pirates |publisher=Riverside Theatre |accessdate=6 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327193646/http://riversideparramatta.com.au/content/files/142/Coming_Clean_Media_Release.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe current Parramatta Correctional Centre was the third gaol to be built in Parramatta and was completed in 1842. The original design was submitted by Mortimer Lewis for [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] in 1835, however the buildings were commenced to a design by Captain [[George Barney]], the Commanding Royal Engineer. When the first building was completed in 1842 by (James) Houison and Payten, Thomas Duke Allen was installed as the gaoler, with his wife Martha acting as matron for the female prisoners.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109>Kerr 1995: 1\u201345</ref><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nBetween 1842 and 1861, a number of improvements were made to conditions within the prison, but major extensions were not undertaken until 1862. As a result of the population boom caused by the gold rushes, both [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and New South Wales were forced to expand their penal facilities between 1858 and 1865. During this time, the perimeter wall of the original gaol was extended to enclose a portion of land equal in size to the existing allotment. In August 1863 as the wall was nearing completion, William Coles, the first clerk of works for the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]], initiated a substantial works programme in both the original and new areas of the gaol. This included demolition of the portion of wall separating the new and old sections of the gaol and the construction of various workshops, a cookhouse and extra cells in existing wings, as well as the installation of new utilities including underground water tanks.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThree further extensions of the gaol perimeter wall were carried out during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Within the new enclosure, three cell wings were slowly built between 1883 and 1889, largely with prison labour. Owing to overcrowding of the observation ward at [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] part of one of these wings was set aside for prisoners who had been deemed insane. In 1899, a 32 unit radial exercise yard was constructed in the space formed on three sides by the recently constructed wings. At this time the cells were also converted from associated cells to single cells, under the influence of comptroller general, William Frederick Neitenstein.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe period from the end of the nineteenth century to WWI was devoted to the improvement of auxiliary facilities \u2013 industrial, spiritual and hygienic. In 1906 \u2013 1908, a chapel was constructed within the prison walls while sewerage and ablutions blocks were upgraded.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nDue to declining entries into the penal system, the gaol was disestablished on 15 September 1918 and the property given over to the inspector of mental hospitals. At this time the western sandstone perimeter walls were demolished and much of the equipment and internal fittings removed. By 1927 however, with an increase in demand on the system, the gaol was rehabilitated and was re-established in 1927. Notably, this rehabilitation involved the conversion of the single cells back to associated cells. Parramatta became a centre for re-training and rehabilitation.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe 1940s began a period of official mistreatment of nineteenth century institutional establishments and a number of unsympathetic buildings were approved for construction. In the 1970s, the Parramatta Linen Service, a large auditorium and an extension to the gatehouse were built. This period also saw the opening of periodic detention centres for males and females.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nA new development scheme completed in 1993 included a pedestrian and large vehicle entry off Dunlop Street and new adjacent buildings for reception, administration and visiting facilities. These new designs attempted to match the form and scale of the original precinct, with hipped roofs and bricks which complemented the sandstone.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe centre closed briefly between 3 September 1997 and 1998.<ref name=\"SR485\">{{cite web |url=http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=\\Agency\\485 |title=Parramatta Correctional Centre |work=State Records |publisher=Government of New South Wales |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504111943/http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=%5CAgency%5C485 |archive-date=4 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, there were calls for the centre to be closed after two inmates escaped by scaling the prison wall using ladders without being seen by guards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Call-to-close-prison-over-escape-farce/2004/11/29/1101577401062.html |title=Call to close prison over escape 'farce' |agency=AAP |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113002057/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Call-to-close-prison-over-escape-farce/2004/11/29/1101577401062.html |archive-date=13 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2011, Corrective Services NSW announced that the Parramatta Correctional Centre would close, which took effect on 9 October 2011.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_corporate.nsf/vwFiles/060911_CS_prisons.pdf/$file/060911_CS_prisons.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prisons to close |date=6 September 2011 |publisher=Corrective Services NSW |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408093813/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_corporate.nsf/vwFiles/060911_CS_prisons.pdf/$file/060911_CS_prisons.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/budget-cuts-will-force-parramatta-jail-closure-20110726-1hyml.html |title=Budget cuts will force Parramatta jail closure |author=Smith, Alexandra |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202534/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/budget-cuts-will-force-parramatta-jail-closure-20110726-1hyml.html |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://parramatta-advertiser.whereilive.com.au/news/story/drop-in-crime-budget-cuts-close-oldest-prison/ |work=Parramatta Advertsier |date=8 August 2011 |title=Drop in crime, budget cuts close Parramatta Correctional Centre |accessdate=6 May 2012 |author=Bartok, Di }}</ref> State Property Management Authority administered the site until 2015,<ref name=nswshr-812/> and has now been returned to the Deerubin Local Aboriginal Lands Council as part of a historic lands grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/aboriginal-land-council-wins-parramatta-gaol-land-claim-20150203-134ucr.html|title=Aboriginal land council wins Parramatta Gaol land claim|first=Melanie|last=Kembrey|date=3 February 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619140124/https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/aboriginal-land-council-wins-parramatta-gaol-land-claim-20150203-134ucr.html|archive-date=19 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\n\n* 1865 \u2013 Perimeter wall extended.

Designed in Old Grecian style, it consists of six cell blocks, three storeys in height. To the rear are three radiating semi-circular or rectangular two storey prison blocks. A number of cells have been enlarged to house two prisoners. Uniformity of materials used during times of addition contribute to the cohesion of this group of sandstone buildings. Talls are generally hand dressed, with slate clad timber roof structure.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nIt was reported to be in good condition as at 28 July 1997. Much of the original precinct remains intact although many of the internal fittings have been removed.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n==Heritage listing==\n\nParramatta Correctional Centre was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nUp until its closure in 2011, the Parramatta Correctional Centre was the oldest gaol in original use in Australia. It is the most intact of the pre-1850s gaols of Australia. It has strong, documented, century and a half associations with people who have shaped its fabric and regimes and with those who have been shaped by it. The complex is also of value to Parramatta as an element in a group of early institutions linked by a parkland setting along the left bank of the [[Parramatta River]], including the [[Cumberland Hospital]] (former Female Factory 1822) and the Norma Parker Centre. (former [[Roman Catholic Orphan School]] of 1841\u201343).<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe constructional character and quality of the early buildings, in particular the stone slab floors, ashlar walls and timber roof trusses, are exceptional. It is significant in its physical and spatial quality as an enclosed complex: in particular the character established by its coherent architectural form and predominant sandstone and slate materials.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe fabric reflects the shifts in penal philosophy and changes in use from the 1830s to the construction of Long Bay in the early twentieth century. The fabric is an educational and archaeological resource, as a continuing document of Australian social history and a potential source of information about the cultural past of the colony since 1788.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Tomorrow\", recorded by Australian rock band [[Cold Chisel]] on their 1980 album ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'', portrays the desperation of a Parramatta Gaol inmate on a life sentence who escaped three days earlier, and is facing imminent recapture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lyrics of Cold Chisel song 'Tomorrow'|url=http://www.coldchisel.com/tomorrow/|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Cold Chisel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707153559/http://www.coldchisel.com/tomorrow/|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Notable prisoners==\n<!--please provide reliable references to avoid potentially libelous misinformation.

Correctional Centre''' is a heritage-listed former [[prison|medium security prison]] for males on the corner of O'Connell and Dunlop Streets, [[North Parramatta]], [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was in operation between 1798 and 2011. The centre was initially called '''Parramatta Gaol''' until its name was changed to Parramatta Correctional Centre in 1992. When in operation, the centre was managed by [[Corrective Services NSW]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Department of Attorney General and Justice (New South Wales)|Department of Attorney General and Justice]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. Immediately prior to its closure, the centre detained short term [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] and [[Remand (detention)|remand]] inmates, operated as a transient centre, and was the [[Periodic Detention Centre|periodic detention centre]] for metropolitan [[Sydney]].\n\nDesigned by George Barney and [[Mortimer Lewis]], the complex is listed on the [[Register of the National Estate]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=town%3Dparramatta%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=3090 |title=Parramatta Gaol (former), 73 O'Connell St, North Parramatta, NSW, Australia |work=[[Australian Heritage Database]] |publisher=Department of the Environment and Energy, [[Australian Government]] |date=14 May 1991 |access-date=20 September 2017 }}</ref> and the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] as a site of State significance.<ref name=nswshr-812>{{cite NSW SHR|5000657|Parramatta Correctional Centre|hr=00812|fn=S90/06416; H00/00112|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCorrectional facilities were first established in Parramatta in 1798, being \"a strong logged gaol of 100 feet in length, with separate cells for the prisoners ... and paled around with very high fence\", housing eight prisoners.<ref name=\"SR485\"/> In 1799, a fire destroyed this facility and it was rebuilt in 1802 on the same site (now occupied by [[Riverside Theatre Parramatta|Riverside Theatres]]).<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.riversideparramatta.com.au/content/files/142/Coming_Clean_Media_Release.pdf |format=PDF |title=Criminals and Parramatta Pirates |publisher=Riverside Theatre |accessdate=6 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327193646/http://riversideparramatta.com.au/content/files/142/Coming_Clean_Media_Release.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe current Parramatta Correctional Centre was the third gaol to be built in Parramatta and was completed in 1842. The original design was submitted by Mortimer Lewis for [[Richard Bourke|Governor Bourke]] in 1835, however the buildings were commenced to a design by Captain [[George Barney]], the Commanding Royal Engineer. When the first building was completed in 1842 by (James) Houison and Payten, Thomas Duke Allen was installed as the gaoler, with his wife Martha acting as matron for the female prisoners.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109>Kerr 1995: 1-45</ref><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nBetween 1842 and 1861, a number of improvements were made to conditions within the prison, but major extensions were not undertaken until 1862. As a result of the population boom caused by the gold rushes, both [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and New South Wales were forced to expand their penal facilities between 1858 and 1865. During this time, the perimeter wall of the original gaol was extended to enclose a portion of land equal in size to the existing allotment. In August 1863 as the wall was nearing completion, William Coles, the first clerk of works for the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]], initiated a substantial works programme in both the original and new areas of the gaol. This included demolition of the portion of wall separating the new and old sections of the gaol and the construction of various workshops, a cookhouse and extra cells in existing wings, as well as the installation of new utilities including underground water tanks.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThree further extensions of the gaol perimeter wall were carried out during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Within the new enclosure, three cell wings were slowly built between 1883 and 1889, largely with prison labour. Owing to overcrowding of the observation ward at [[Darlinghurst Gaol]] part of one of these wings was set aside for prisoners who had been deemed insane. In 1899, a 32 unit radial exercise yard was constructed in the space formed on three sides by the recently constructed wings. At this time the cells were also converted from associated cells to single cells, under the influence of comptroller general, William Frederick Neitenstein.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe period from the end of the nineteenth century to WWI was devoted to the improvement of auxiliary facilities - industrial, spiritual and hygienic. In 1906 - 1908, a chapel was constructed within the prison walls while sewerage and ablutions blocks were upgraded.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nDue to declining entries into the penal system, the gaol was disestablished on 15 September 1918 and the property given over to the inspector of mental hospitals. At this time the western sandstone perimeter walls were demolished and much of the equipment and internal fittings removed. By 1927 however, with an increase in demand on the system, the gaol was rehabilitated and was re-established in 1927. Notably, this rehabilitation involved the conversion of the single cells back to associated cells. Parramatta became a centre for re-training and rehabilitation.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe 1940s began a period of official mistreatment of nineteenth century institutional establishments and a number of unsympathetic buildings were approved for construction. In the 1970s, the Parramatta Linen Service, a large auditorium and an extension to the gatehouse were built. This period also saw the opening of periodic detention centres for males and females.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nA new development scheme completed in 1993 included a pedestrian and large vehicle entry off Dunlop Street and new adjacent buildings for reception, administration and visiting facilities. These new designs attempted to match the form and scale of the original precinct, with hipped roofs and bricks which complemented the sandstone.<ref name=nswshr-812-1109/><ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nThe centre closed briefly between 3 September 1997 and 1998.<ref name=\"SR485\">{{cite web |url=http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=\\Agency\\485 |title=Parramatta Correctional Centre |work=State Records |publisher=Government of New South Wales |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504111943/http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=%5CAgency%5C485 |archive-date=4 May 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, there were calls for the centre to be closed after two inmates escaped by scaling the prison wall using ladders without being seen by guards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Call-to-close-prison-over-escape-farce/2004/11/29/1101577401062.html |title=Call to close prison over escape 'farce' |agency=AAP |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113002057/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Call-to-close-prison-over-escape-farce/2004/11/29/1101577401062.html |archive-date=13 November 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2011, Corrective Services NSW announced that the Parramatta Correctional Centre would close, which took effect on 9 October 2011.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_corporate.nsf/vwFiles/060911_CS_prisons.pdf/$file/060911_CS_prisons.pdf |format=PDF |title=Prisons to close |date=6 September 2011 |publisher=Corrective Services NSW |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408093813/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_corporate.nsf/vwFiles/060911_CS_prisons.pdf/$file/060911_CS_prisons.pdf |archive-date=8 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/budget-cuts-will-force-parramatta-jail-closure-20110726-1hyml.html |title=Budget cuts will force Parramatta jail closure |author=Smith, Alexandra |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310202534/http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/budget-cuts-will-force-parramatta-jail-closure-20110726-1hyml.html |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://parramatta-advertiser.whereilive.com.au/news/story/drop-in-crime-budget-cuts-close-oldest-prison/ |work=Parramatta Advertsier |date=8 August 2011 |title=Drop in crime, budget cuts close Parramatta Correctional Centre |accessdate=6 May 2012 |author=Bartok, Di }}</ref> State Property Management Authority administered the site until 2015,<ref name=nswshr-812/> and has now been returned to the Deerubin Local Aboriginal Lands Council as part of a historic lands grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/aboriginal-land-council-wins-parramatta-gaol-land-claim-20150203-134ucr.html|title=Aboriginal land council wins Parramatta Gaol land claim|first=Melanie|last=Kembrey|date=3 February 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619140124/https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/aboriginal-land-council-wins-parramatta-gaol-land-claim-20150203-134ucr.html|archive-date=19 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Timeline===\n\n* 1865 - Perimeter wall extended.

Designed in Old Grecian style, it consists of six cell blocks, three storeys in height. To the rear are three radiating semi-circular or rectangular two storey prison blocks. A number of cells have been enlarged to house two prisoners. Uniformity of materials used during times of addition contribute to the cohesion of this group of sandstone buildings. Talls are generally hand dressed, with slate clad timber roof structure.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\nIt was reported to be in good condition as at 28 July 1997. Much of the original precinct remains intact although many of the internal fittings have been removed.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n==Heritage listing==\n\nParramatta Correctional Centre was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nUp until its closure in 2011, the Parramatta Correctional Centre was the oldest gaol in original use in Australia. It is the most intact of the pre-1850s gaols of Australia. It has strong, documented, century and a half associations with people who have shaped its fabric and regimes and with those who have been shaped by it. The complex is also of value to Parramatta as an element in a group of early institutions linked by a parkland setting along the left bank of the [[Parramatta River]], including the [[Cumberland Hospital]] (former Female Factory 1822) and the Norma Parker Centre. (former [[Roman Catholic Orphan School]] of 1841-43).<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe constructional character and quality of the early buildings, in particular the stone slab floors, ashlar walls and timber roof trusses, are exceptional. It is significant in its physical and spatial quality as an enclosed complex: in particular the character established by its coherent architectural form and predominant sandstone and slate materials.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe fabric reflects the shifts in penal philosophy and changes in use from the 1830s to the construction of Long Bay in the early twentieth century. The fabric is an educational and archaeological resource, as a continuing document of Australian social history and a potential source of information about the cultural past of the colony since 1788.<ref name=nswshr-812/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Tomorrow\", recorded by Australian rock band [[Cold Chisel]] on their 1980 album ''[[East (Cold Chisel album)|East]]'', portrays the desperation of a Parramatta Gaol inmate on a life sentence who escaped three days earlier, and is facing imminent recapture.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lyrics of Cold Chisel song 'Tomorrow'|url=http://www.coldchisel.com/tomorrow/|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Cold Chisel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707153559/http://www.coldchisel.com/tomorrow/|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Notable prisoners==\n<!--please provide reliable references to avoid potentially libelous misinformation.

The one-child policy is a factor behind this development. According to the Chinese Central Government, the one-child policy prevented approximately 400 million births. Experts continue to debate this figure, however. Some argue that such a drop in fertility is typical for a rapidly industrializing country while others believe it actually accelerates the aging process. According to demographer Zhen Binwen of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], China's labor force would peak in 2015. Almost 7% of China's population were 65 years or older in 2000, a benchmark after which the United Nations considers a population to be aging. China is in fact aging quite quickly. UN figures show that China's ratio of people aged 60 and over increased 3.8% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the global average of 3% between 1950 and 2010. Therefore, China is one of the developing countries with aging populations. The nation's quickly growing and export-driven economy will slow down, as the advantage of abundant and cheap labor fades away. Life expectancy in China rose from 43 in 1960 to 3 in 2010, thanks to improved standards of living, better nutrition, and access to healthcare and education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zhang|first=Wei|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-19572056|title=Ageing China: Changes and challenges|date=September 20, 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=live|department=Asia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender imbalances in China and India.

Coupled with an exceptionally long life expectancy (85 years for women and 78 for men, as of 2005) and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, this means that by 2050, 30% of Japanese will be over the age of 60.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the [[total fertility rate]]<nowiki/>s (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s had leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility that cemented itself in subsequent demographic cohorts. Member states of the European Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":232\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

At first sight, it appears that this might be due to their socially progressive values and policies, i.e. making it easier for women to pursue both their careers and reproductive dreams. However, closer scrutiny suggests the argument that \"feminism is the new pro-natalism\" is untenable, given that there are socially progressive countries with low fertility rates such as Austria and Canada on one hand, and more conservative and traditionalist countries with high fertility rates such as Ireland and the United States on the other.<ref name=\":232\" />\n[[File:Population pyramid of the European Union 2016.png|thumb|350x350px|Population pyramid of the European Union in 2016|alt=]]\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, Europe has a population aging at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that by 2050, 40% of Europeans will be over the age of 60. This problem is especially acute in the East whereas in the West, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27896504|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018).

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007-8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. One solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.

According to Statistics Canada, the number of households with both grandparents and grandchildren remained rare but has been growing. In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in early twenty-first century cannot (or think they cannot) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggle to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Between grandparents and parents, potential sources of friction include the diets of the children, their sleep schedule, how to discipline them, and how they may use electronic gadgets. Parents today are more reliant on the Internet for information than their own parents, and many even recommend that they take grandparenting classes.

The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite widespread concern over rising student debt, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008-9 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a government agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008-9 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995.

Known as the ''Service National Universel'' or SNU ([[:fr:Service national universel]]), it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the [[Flag of France|tricolor]], and sing the [[La Marseillaise|national anthem]]. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how navigating with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much.<ref name=\":6\" /> The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some \u20ac1.6 billion.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190711-france-civic-service-military-volunteer-french-values-macron-first-aid-national-cohesion|title=National civic service: A crash course in self-defence, emergency responses and French values|last=Villeminot|first=Florence|date=July 11, 2019|work=France 24|access-date=November 5, 2019|department=French Connection}}</ref> Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad.<ref name=\":4\" /> A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian.

Compared to the 2017-18 academic year, 2018-19 saw a drop of 1% in the number of foreign students.

Whereas in the past, Chinese firms copied the business strategies and models from their U.S. counterparts, now, they are developing their own approaches, and Southeast Asian companies are learning from their success and experience, a practice known as \"Copy from China.\" E-commerce has been flourishing. In Singapore, for example, not only is it now possible to place orders online, one may also purchase groceries in person, pay by mobile phone, and have them packed by machines; there are no cashiers. Whereas Westerners were first introduced to the Internet via their personal computers, people in China and Southeast Asia first got online with their mobile phones. Consequently, the e-commerce industry's heavy usage of mobile phone applications has paid off handsomely. In particular, Chinese entrepreneurs invest in what are known as \"super-apps,\" those that enable users to access all kinds of services within them, not just messaging, but also bike rentals and digital wallets. In Indonesia, relying on credit-card payments is difficult because the market penetration of this technology remains rather low (as of 2019).

However, the picture varies depending on the country. In Italy, environmentally friendly architecture is in high demand. Estonia and France are running short of legal professionals.

All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the dropout rate is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments.

According to this \"hygiene hypothesis,\" such exposures give the infant's immune system some exercise, making it less likely to overreact. Evidence for this includes the fact that children living on a farm are consistently less likely to be allergic than their counterparts who are raised in the city, and that children born in a developed country to parents who immigrated from developing nations are more likely to be allergic than their parents are.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nA research article published in 2019 in the Lancet journal reported that the number of South Africans aged 15 to 19 being treated for HIV increased by a factor of ten between 2019 and 2010.

Researchers also asked over 600 non-Christian teenagers and almost 500 adults what their biggest barriers to faith were.

For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century.<ref name=\":21\" /> According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025. In addition, the Catholic Church has gained 12% additional followers between 2000 and 2010, mainly from Asia and Africa.<ref name=\":21\" /> In 2018, Muslims had a median age of 23, Hindus 26, Christians 30, Buddhists and the religiously unaffiliated 34, and Jews 36. For comparison, the median age of the global population was 28 in 2018. Overall, Christians have a fertility rate of 2.6, and Muslims 2.9. Islam is the world's fastest growing religion.<ref name=\":14\" /> Meanwhile, the expansion of secularism will slow in Europe as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nBut religion can grow even in otherwise secular societies.<ref name=\":21\" /> For example, in Israel, the ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just about five percent of the nation's primary schoolchildren in 1960, but by the start of the twenty-first century, one third of Jewish first graders in Israel came from this religious sect.<ref name=\":232\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women in Israel had on average 7.5 children compared to their more mainstream counterparts with just over two in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":21\" /> In Europe, immigration from the Middle East and Africa is an engine of religious growth. Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists,<ref name=\":21\" /> who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s.<ref name=\":232\" /> In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well-known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization.<ref name=\":21\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three quarters of Jewish births at the start of the twenty-first century. (This group is projected to make up the majority of Anglo-American Jews by 2050.)<ref name=\":232\" /> In the United States, Catholicism will become the largest religion by 2040 despite considerable losses to secularization and conversion to Protestantism thanks in no small part to the fact that Latino Catholics had a fertility rate of 2.83 compared to the national average of 2.03 in 2003. Such religious demographic changes will bring about social and political ramifications later in the century.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n== Risky behaviors ==\nGeneration Z is generally more risk-averse in certain activities than earlier generations. In 2013, 66% of American teenagers (older members of Generation Z) had tried alcohol, down from 82% in 1991 (younger Generation X).

The one-child policy is a factor behind this development. According to the Chinese Central Government, the one-child policy prevented approximately 400 million births. Experts continue to debate this figure, however. Some argue that such a drop in fertility is typical for a rapidly industrializing country while others believe it actually accelerates the aging process. According to demographer Zhen Binwen of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], China's labor force would peak in 2015. Almost 7% of China's population were 65 years or older in 2000, a benchmark after which the United Nations considers a population to be aging. China is in fact aging quite quickly. UN figures show that China's ratio of people aged 60 and over increased 3.8% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the global average of 3% between 1950 and 2010. Therefore, China is one of the developing countries with aging populations. The nation's quickly growing and export-driven economy will slow down, as the advantage of abundant and cheap labor fades away. Life expectancy in China rose from 43 in 1960 to 3 in 2010, thanks to improved standards of living, better nutrition, and access to healthcare and education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zhang|first=Wei|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-19572056|title=Ageing China: Changes and challenges|date=September 20, 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=February 15, 2020|url-status=live|department=Asia}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there have been severe gender imbalances in China and India.

By the late 1960s or 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a \"correction,\" such a rebound never came. Despite a bump in the [[total fertility rate]]<nowiki/>s (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, they never returned to replacement level; the bump was largely due to older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist [[Gary Becker]] argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the [[Demographic transition#Second demographic transition|second demographic transition]].) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s had leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility that cemented itself in subsequent demographic cohorts. Member states of the European Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 to 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed.<ref name=\":232\">{{Cite book|title=Whither the Child?

At first sight, it appears that this might be due to their socially progressive values and policies, i.e. making it easier for women to pursue both their careers and reproductive dreams. However, closer scrutiny suggests the argument that \"feminism is the new pro-natalism\" is untenable, given that there are socially progressive countries with low fertility rates such as Austria and Canada on one hand, and more conservative and traditionalist countries with high fertility rates such as Ireland and the United States on the other.<ref name=\":232\" />\n[[File:Population pyramid of the European Union 2016.png|thumb|350x350px|Population pyramid of the European Union in 2016|alt=]]\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, Europe has a population aging at an unprecedented rate. It is estimated that by 2050, 40% of Europeans will be over the age of 60. This problem is especially acute in the East whereas in the West, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Eric|author-link=Eric Kaufmann|date=Winter 2010|title=Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27896504|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|volume=99|issue=396, the future of religion|pages=387\u201394|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991.

The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having a lot of children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007-8, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad \u2013 150,000 did in 2018 \u2013 and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly. One solution to this problem is incentivizing reproduction, as France has done, by investing in longer parental leaves, daycare, and tax exemptions for parents. As of 2019, France has approximately the same population as Italy but 65% more births. Another solution is immigration, which has been alleviating the decline, but it does not come without political backlash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-italy-rising-anxiety-over-falling-birth-rates|title=In Italy, rising anxiety over falling birth rates|last=Livesay|first=Christopher|date=November 25, 2019|work=PBS Newshour|access-date=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGreece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.

In 2011, five percent of Canadian children below the age of ten lived with a grandparent, up from 3.3% in the previous decade. This is in part because Canadian parents in early twenty-first century cannot (or think they cannot) afford childcare and often find themselves having to work long hours or irregular shifts. Meanwhile, many grandparents struggle to keep up with their highly active grandchildren on a regular basis due to their age. Between grandparents and parents, potential sources of friction include the diets of the children, their sleep schedule, how to discipline them, and how they may use electronic gadgets. Parents today are more reliant on the Internet for information than their own parents, and many even recommend that they take grandparenting classes.

Students from China and Singapore, both outside of the OECD, continued to outclass their global peers. Among all the countries that sent their students to take the PISA, only Albania, Colombia, Macao, Moldova, Peru, Portugal, and Qatar saw any improvements since joining. Of these, only Portugal is an OECD country. Meanwhile, Australia, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovakia, and South Korea all saw a decline in overall performance since joining. Funding, while important, is not necessarily the most important thing, as the case of Estonia demonstrates.

However, Swedish students typically graduate with a lot of debt due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite widespread concern over rising student debt, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008-9 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a government agency known as the [[National Board of Student Aid (Sweden)|Centrala Studiest\u00f6dsn\u00e4mnden]] (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children's education. In the 2008-9 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-high-price-of-a-free-college-education-in-sweden/276428/|title=The High Price of a Free College Education in Sweden|last=Philips|first=Matt|date=May 31, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=November 4, 2019|department=Global}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems.

Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, \"Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.\" Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of \u20ac8,500 as of 2005.

Known as the ''Service National Universel'' or SNU ([[:fr:Service national universel]]), it is a compulsory civic service. While students will not have to shave their heads or handle military equipment, they will have to sleep in tents, get up early (at 6:30 am), participate in various physical activities, raise the [[Flag of France|tricolor]], and sing the [[La Marseillaise|national anthem]]. They will have to wear a uniform, though it is more akin to the outfit of security guards rather than military personnel. This program takes a total of four weeks. In the first two, youths learn how to provide first aid, how navigating with a map, how to recognize fake news, emergency responses for various scenarios, and self-defense. In addition, they get health checks and get tested on their mastery of the French language, and they participate in debates on a variety of social issues, including environmentalism, state secularism, and gender equality. In the second fortnight, they volunteer with a charity for local government. The aim of this program is to promote national cohesion and patriotism, at a time of deep division on religious and political grounds, to get people out of their neighborhoods and regions, and mix people of different socioeconomic classes, something mandatory military service used to do. Supporters thought that teenagers rarely raise the national flag, spend too much time on their phones, and felt nostalgic for the era of compulsory military service, considered a rite of passage for young men and a tool of character-building. Critics argued that this program is inadequate, and would cost too much.<ref name=\":6\" /> The SNU is projected to affect some 800,000 French citizens each year when it becomes mandatory for all aged 16 to 21 by 2026, at a cost of some \u20ac1.6 billion.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20190711-france-civic-service-military-volunteer-french-values-macron-first-aid-national-cohesion|title=National civic service: A crash course in self-defence, emergency responses and French values|last=Villeminot|first=Florence|date=July 11, 2019|work=France 24|access-date=November 5, 2019|department=French Connection}}</ref> Another major concern is that it will overburden the French military, already stretched thin by counter-terrorism campaigns at home and abroad.<ref name=\":4\" /> A 2015 IFOP poll revealed that 80% of the French people supported some kind of mandatory service, military, or civilian.

But that changed in the 1980s when [[Deng Xiaoping]] introduced economic reforms; the middle and upper classes have blossoming ever since. In fact, he considered getting rich to be \"glorious.\" Chinese cities have morphed into major shopping centers. The number of billionaires (in U.S. dollars) in China is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, so much so that butler academies, whose students will serve the 'new rich', and [[finishing school]]s, whose students were born to rich parents, have been established. However, according to the World Bank, 27% of Chinese still live below the poverty line. The Chinese Central Government promised to end poverty by 2020. President [[Xi Jinping]]'s anti-corruption campaign also cracks down on what he considered 'ostentatious displays of wealth'.

In Singapore, for example, not only is it now possible to place orders online, one may also purchase groceries in person, pay by mobile phone, and have them packed by machines; there are no cashiers. Whereas Westerners were first introduced to the Internet via their personal computers, people in China and Southeast Asia first got online with their mobile phones. Consequently, the e-commerce industry's heavy usage of mobile phone applications has paid off handsomely. In particular, Chinese entrepreneurs invest in what are known as \"super-apps,\" those that enable users to access all kinds of services within them, not just messaging, but also bike rentals and digital wallets. In Indonesia, relying on credit-card payments is difficult because the market penetration of this technology remains rather low (as of 2019). Nevertheless, e-commerce and ride-hailing are growing there, too. But it is Singapore that is the startup hub of the region, thanks to its excellent infrastructure, government support, and abundant capital.

All member states except Finland need more ICT specialists, and all but Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the United Kingdom need more teachers. The supply of STEM graduates has been insufficient because the dropout rate is high and because of an ongoing brain drain from some countries. Some countries need more teachers because many are retiring and need to be replaced. At the same time, Europe's aging population necessitates the expansion of the healthcare sector. Disincentives for (potential) workers in jobs in high demand include low social prestige, low salaries, and stressful work environments.

Addressing climate change is very important for Generation Z in India, and South Korea, and tackling wealth and income inequality is of vital importance to the same in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifac.org/system/files/uploads/PPRAG/IFAC_GenZ_Report_FINAL.pdf|title=Identifying What Matters Most to the Next Generation|last=|first=|date=2019|website=International Federation of Accountants|url-status=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref> [[File:View on Climate Change.png|right|600x600px]]\n2018 surveys of teenagers 13 to 17 and adults aged 18 or over conducted by the Pew Research Center found that Generation Z had broadly similar views to the Millennials on various political and social issues. More specifically, 54% of Generation Z believed that climate change is real and is due to human activities while only 10% reject the [[scientific consensus on climate change]]. (See chart.) 70% wanted the government to play a more active role in solving their problems. 67% were indifferent towards pre-nuptial cohabitation. 49% considered single motherhood to be neither a positive or a negative for society. 62% saw increased ethnic or racial diversity as good for society. As did 48% for same-sex marriage, and 53% for interracial marriage. In most cases, Generation Z and the Millennials tended hold quite different views from the Silent Generation, with the Baby Boomers and Generation X in between. In the case of financial responsibility in a two-parent household, though, majorities from across the generations answered that it should be shared, with 58% for the Silent Generation, 73% for the Baby Boomers, 78% for Generation X, and 79% for both the Millennials and Generation Z. Across all the generations surveyed, at least 84% thought that both parents ought to be responsible for rearing children. About 13% of Generation Z thought that mothers should be the primary caretaker of children, with similar percentages for the other demographic cohorts.

For example, in the cities of the Middle East, women who supported Sharia law had a 50% fertility advantage over those who opposed it the most at the turn of the century.<ref name=\":21\" /> According to the World Religious Database, the proportion of the human population identifying with a religion increased from 81% in 1970 to 85% in 2000 and is predicted to rise to 87% in 2025.

Children of immigrants tend to be about as religious as their parents and consider their religion to be a marker of their ethnic identity, thereby insulating themselves from the secularizing forces of the host society. The other engine is comparatively high fertility and religious endogamy. In France, a white Catholic woman had half a child more than her secular counterparts in the early 2000s; in Spain, that number was 0.77.<ref name=\":21\" /> In the Netherlands, the youngest villages belong to Orthodox Calvinists,<ref name=\":21\" /> who comprised 7% of the Dutch population by the early 2000s.<ref name=\":232\" /> In Austria, the number of people below the age of 15 who were Muslims rose past the 10%-mark in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In the United Kingdom, over 90% of Muslims married other Muslims by the turn of the millennium, and it is well-known that children born into an interfaith marriage tend to be less religious than their parents. Interfaith marriage is in fact a vehicle of secularization.<ref name=\":21\" /> Ultra-Orthodox Jews comprised just 12% of the British Jewish population but three quarters of Jewish births at the start of the twenty-first century.

Countries or education systems whose students scored near or above the international average of 496 in CIL were, in increasing order, France, North Rhine-Westphalia, Portugal, Germany, the United States, Finland, South Korea, Moscow, and Denmark. CT is divided into four levels, the Upper, Middle, and Lower Regions. International averages for the proportions of students reaching each of these were 18%, 50%, and 32%, respectively.

[[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] are seen to be gaining popularity among members of Generation Z, with 24% (and growing) of teens with access to the Internet having Twitter accounts.<ref name=\"Madden\" /> This is, in part, due to parents not typically using these social networking sites.<ref name=\"Madden\" /> [[Snapchat]] is also seen to have gained attraction in Generation Z because videos, pictures, and messages send much faster on it than in regular messaging.

At age 10, 10% of female subjects reported social media use, while this was only true for 7% of the male subjects. By age 15, this variation jumped to 53% for girls, and 41% for boys. This percentage influx may explain why more girls reported experiencing cyberbullying, decreased self-esteem, and emotional instability more than their male counterparts.\n\nOther researchers hypothesize that girls are more affected by social media usage because of ''how'' they use it. In a study conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015, researchers discovered that while 78% girls reported to making a friend through social media, only 52% of boys could say the same.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref> However, boys are not explicitly less affected by this statistic.
