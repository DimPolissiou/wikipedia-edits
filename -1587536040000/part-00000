After graduating Harvard, Chandrachud first worked at [[Sullivan and Cromwell]], a law firm. Chandrachud describes this as \"sheer fluke\" due to the strong pecking order that existed at that time, and a strong bias against Indians and similar developing countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=The evolution of India's legal system - a lecture by Justice D.Y.

During this time, he was also Director of Maharashtra Judicial Academy. All through, he practised law at the Supreme Court of India and the Bombay High Court.

S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) and Anr. vs Union Of India And Ors.]] as part of a unanimous nine-judge Bench decision of the Indian Supreme Court which affirmed that the right to privacy is a constitutionally guaranteed right under the Indian Constitution.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2012/35071/35071_2012_Judgement_24-Aug-2017.pdf|title=Privacy judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud grounded the right to privacy in dignity, liberty, autonomy, bodily and mental integrity, self-determination and across a spectrum of protected rights. Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>The judgment is also noteworthy for Justice Chandrachud\u2019s observations on sexual autonomy and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/law/justice-chandrachud-judgment-right-to-privacy|title=Key Highlights of Justice Chandrachud's Judgment in the Right to Privacy Case|website=The Wire|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> In 2013, a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in [[Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation]] upheld [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] which criminalized carnal intercourse against the order of nature. Justice Chandrachud referred to the decision as striking \u201ca discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He observed that the decision was wrong as \u201cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether ''legislative or popular''.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He concluded by disagreeing \u201cwith the manner in which Koushal has dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity-based claims of LGBT persons\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and held that:<blockquote>The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.\u00a0 Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019. Yet in a democratic constitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties.

The Court observed the numerous deficiencies in the process leading to the grant of the clearance and directed that a rapid EIA be conducted afresh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2019/03/30/environmental-clearance-for-development-of-airport-at-mopa-goa-to-be-revisited/|title=Environmental Clearance for development of Airport at Mopa, Goa to be revisited|last=Bhardwaj|first=Prachi|date=2019-03-29|website=SCC Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/sc-suspends-environmental-clearance-to-mopa-airport-asks-eac-to-revisit-decision|title=Supreme Court Suspends Environmental Clearance Granted To Goa\u2019s Mopa Airport|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> by the project proponent.

A framework of environmental governance committed to the rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution. Where the health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life as a constitutionally recognized value under Article 21 of the Constitution, proper structures for environmental decision making find expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud has also authored a judgment on the validity of grating ''ex post facto'' Environmental Clearances in Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Rohit Prajapati.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/2562/2562_2016_0_1501_21582_Judgement_01-Apr-2020.pdf|title=Alembic Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The erstwhile Ministry of Environmental and Forests had issued an administrative circular in 2002 envisaging the grant of ''ex post facto'' clearances to those industries that had failed to comply with the mandatory EIA notification of 1994. The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development.<ref name=\":9\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Constitutional Judgments on Governance ===\n\n==== Ordinances ====\nJustice Chandrachud was a part of the seven-judge bench in Krishna Kumar Singh v.

This approach, with respect fails to notice the critical distinction between an enactment of a competent legislature and an ordinance. Acceptance of the doctrine of enduring rights in the context of an ordinance would lead to a situation where the exercise of power by the Governor would survive in terms of the creation of the rights and privileges\u2026The legislature may not have had an opportunity to even discuss or debate the Ordinance\u2026. The enduring rights theory attributes a degree of permanence to the power to promulgate ordinances in derogation of parliamentary control and supremacy.<ref name=\":10\" /></blockquote>He also observed that laying down ordinances before the Parliament is a mandatory constitutional obligation that cannot be bypassed.

It was observed that he had to follow the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except when the matter was related to police, public order and land. It was also held that by virtue of Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor could, in the case of any disagreement between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor, refer \u2018exceptional\u2019 matters to the President seeking his opinion. In such cases, the decision of the President would be final.

Justice Chandrachud emphasized on the obligation of the Lieutenant Governor to abide by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government and observed that the interpretation that aids the basic features of representative governance and the cabinet form of government should be adopted. He held:<blockquote>\u2026in defining the ambit of the constitutional powers entrusted to the Council of Ministers for the NCT and their relationship with Lieutenant Governor as a delegate of the President, the Court cannot be unmindful of the constitutional importance which has to be assigned to representative government. Representative government is a hallmark of a Constitution which is wedded to democracy for it is through a democratic form of governance that the aspirations of those who elect their representatives are met.</blockquote>\n\n==== The Floor test as a means of ensuring collective responsibility ====\nJustice Chandrachud authored a judgment with far reaching consequences in the political sphere in Shivraj Singh Chouhan. v. Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-373058.pdf|title=MP Floor test Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud held that the Governor\u2019s exercise of power to convene the legislative assembly for a floor test during an ongoing session of the assembly was \u201clegitimate to the purpose of ensuring that the norm of collective responsibility is duly preserved\u201d. He accepted the submission that the Governor commands the power to order a floor test if the Governor has \u2013 based on \u201cobjective material\u201d \u2013 reasons to believe that the government has lost its majority. Significantly, he noted that the power of the Governor is not unbridled in the following terms:<blockquote>Where the exercise of the discretion by the Governor to call a floor test is challenged before the court, it is not immune from judicial review. The court is entitled to determine whether in calling for the floor test, the Governor did so on the basis of objective material and reasons \u00a0which were relevant and germane to the exercise of the power. The exercise of such a power is not intended to destabilize or displace a democratically elected government accountable to the legislative assembly and collectively responsible to it.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>In a first of its kind observation, Justice Chandrachud also noted the state of politics in the country and called for changes to strengthen the nature of the Indian democratic system in the following terms:<blockquote>The spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations does little credit to the state our democratic politics. It is an unfortunate reflection of the confidence \u00a0which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of the politics to lure away persons from rival camps\u2026 It is best that courts maintain an arm\u2019s length from the sordid tales of political life. In defining constitutional principle, however, this Court must be conscious of the position on the ground as admitted by Counsel of both sides and an effort has to be made to the extent possible to ensure that democratic values prevail.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Affirmative Action ===\nJustice Chandrachud has authored numerous judgments on affirmative action in India. Foremost amongst these is his judgment in B.K. Pavitra II v.

Justice Chandrachud held that the \u201cwithdrawal of civil benefits flowed as a logical result of the validation of a claim to belong to a group or category for whom the reservation is intended\u201d and that \u201cthe selection of ineligible persons is a manifestation of a systematic failure and has deleterious effects on good governance.\u201d Observing that the governing state legislation explicitly specified the consequences of relying upon a false caste certificate, the Court held that recourse to the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 would not be justified. In the same vein, Justice Chandrachud observed that where there was a statutory bar to conferring benefits on the basis of a false certificate, administrative circulars and government resolutions, being subservient to legislative mandate, would not be permitted to cure the defect of a false caste certificate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/appointment-secured-fraudulent-caste-certificates-void-ab-initio-153836|title=Appointment Secured On The Basis Of A Fraudulent Caste Certificate Is Void Ab Initio: SC [Read Order]|last=Kini|first=Ashok|date=2020-03-14|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial and Insurance Law ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored opinions in several commercial disputes and emphasized the principles of certainty and objectivity in the area of commercial law. He rejected the challenge by Adani Gas Limited<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2019/14043/14043_2019_8_1502_20635_Judgement_17-Feb-2020.pdf|title=Adani Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to the grant of authorisations for the construction and operation of consumer gas distribution networks in the state of Tamil Nadu. The dispute concerned the alleged addition of certain bidding criteria ''after the last date for bidding''.\u00a0 In upholding the decisions taken by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, Justice Chandrachud noted that the\u00a0 \u00a0additional criteria had only been proposed by the regulator as an agenda item, but was never subsequently adopted. He also observed that when a tender is challenged by a bidder, the dispute remains solely between the bidder and the regulator, and the regulator\u2019s treatment of other bids that have no bearing on the disputed bid cannot be used to allege a case of arbitrariness against the regulator\u2019s actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/sc-dismisses-adani-gas-plea-against-piped-gas-distribution-award/1741786|title=SC dismisses Adani Gas'' plea against piped gas distribution award|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cgd-authorisation-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-of-adani-gas-imc/1871031/|title=CGD authorisation: Supreme Court dismisses appeals of Adani Gas, IMC|date=2020-02-18|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nJustice Chandrachud also authored a judgment governing the liquidation of Super Bazar. The once-iconic Co-Operative Society had fallen on hard times and Writers and Publishers had won the bid to revive Super Bazar under a court regulated recovery scheme. However, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found several accounting irregularities in the management of Super Bazar by Writers and Publishers. \u00a0Justice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment held that it would be against the first principles of insolvency if a resolution applicant were to be refunded their investment after a failed revival effort. His opinion directed that Super Bazar\u2019s assets be handed over to the official liquidator and disposed of in accordance with the statutory order of preferences.\n\n'''''Insurance Law'''''\n\nJustice Chandrachud has authored opinions regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts. In one such decision,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/25167/25167_2016_Judgement_24-Apr-2019.pdf|title=Insurance Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a claim was filed by the wife of the deceased who while riding his motorcycle, experienced pain in the chest and shoulder, suffered a heart attack and fell from the motorcycle. Justice Chandrachud discussed extensively the jurisprudence on insurance law in various jurisdictions, dealt with the interpretation of the expressions \u2018accident\u2019, \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018outward, violent and visible means\u2019.

Justice Chandrachud noted that the system of adequate disclosures helps to narrow down the gap of information asymmetries between the parties and helps the insurers to assess their risk appetite. He held:<blockquote>Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth.

[[World Bank Chief Economist]] [[Paul Romer]] described Aadhaar as \u201cthe most sophisticated ID programme in the world\u201d. As the basis for the overarching system had been laid down in 2010, the Aadhaar system was subject to a wide range of orders by the Supreme Court between 2013 and 2019. The Act was challenged before the Supreme Court on numerous grounds, which included a charge of by passing the Upper House or Rajya Sabha by being passed as a Money Bill, of \u00a0creating a surveillance state, and creating a class of citizens which would be excluded from the class of beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/overview-legal-issues-around-aadhaar|title=Overview of the Legal Issues around Aadhaar|date=2017-06-10|website=PRSIndia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Some groups also raised significant privacy concerns with the government database that held the biometric and personal information of every individual in the country.\n\nIn the judgment dated 28 September 2018, the Indian Supreme Court upheld that constitutional validity of the Act by a 4-1 majority, with Justice Chandrachud penning the sole dissent.

He held:<blockquote>The risks which the use of Aadhaar \u201cfor any purpose\u201d carries is that when it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private entities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that connects the cell phone with geo-location data, one\u2019s presence and movement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle consumption with medical records. This starts a \u201ccausal link\u201d between information \u00a0which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. Thus, <u>linking Aadhaar with different databases</u> carries the potential of being profiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also carries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by affecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create co-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected\u2026 When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, ''it becomes a bridge across discreet data silos'', which allows anyone with access to this information to re-construct a profile of an individual\u2019s life.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>At the time when the case was being heard before the Supreme Court, whistleblowers\u00a0had warned of the possible implications of the infrastructure in creating a surveillance state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/aadhaar-is-mass-surveillance-system-will-lead-to-civil-death-for-indians-edward-snowden-1319121-2018-08-20|title=Aadhaar is mass surveillance system, will lead to civil death for Indians: Edward Snowden|last=DelhiAugust 20|first=India Today Tech New|last2=August 20|first2=2018UPDATED:|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21|last3=Ist|first3=2018 16:25}}</ref> Following the judgment, academicians documented the growth in state surveillance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/news/the-aadhaar-card-cybersecurity-issues-with-indias-biometric-experiment/|title=The Aadhaar Card: Cybersecurity Issues with India's Biometric Experiment|date=2019-05-09|website=The Henry M.

He held that the absence of consent within the Act, the extent of information disclosed, the expansive scope of the term \u201cbiometrics\u201d, the burden placed upon the individual to update her own biometrics, and lack of access to the record, cumulatively constitute a serious infringement of privacy.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== ''Proportionality'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud drew from academic literature as well as jurisprudence across national frontiers on the proportionality standard and held that the burden to justify that the method adopted lies on the state and it must be demonstrated that the chosen method is both necessary and the least intrusive manner of achieving the stated objective. Circumspect of the Aadhaar infrastructure in plugging loopholes in welfare leakages, he held that:<blockquote>The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and extent of the State\u2019s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the rights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be proportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging of welfare leakage and better targeting\u2026 \u2026 by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar program treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the State to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime or an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief and judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which infringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the Constitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the State\u2026 the state has failed to demonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than biometric authentication will not sub serve its purposes.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>As part of his analysis, he noted the potential of the Aadhaar infrastructure to further bread inequality and the burden on the state to remedy any potential failings ''prior'' to the implementation of a nation wide infrastructure. He held:<blockquote>Technological error would result in authentication failures. The concerns raised by UIDAI ought to have been resolved before the implementation of the Aadhaar project. Poor connectivity in rural India was a major concern. The majority of the Indian population lives in rural areas. Even a small percentage of error results in a population of crores being affected. Denial of subsidies and benefits to them due to the infirmities of biometric technology is a threat to good governance and social parity\u2026 No failure rate in the provision of social welfare benefits can be regarded as acceptable. Basic entitlements in matters such as food grain, can brook no error. To deny food is to lead a family to destitution, malnutrition and even death.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== ''Money Bill'' ====\nConsidered the \u2018heart\u2019 of his dissent,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ijlpp.com/the-aadhaar-judgment-legal-complications-of-a-money-bill/|title=THE AADHAAR JUDGMENT : LEGAL COMPLICATIONS OF A MONEY BILL|date=2018-10-23|website=THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> , Justice Chandrachud struck down of the entire Act as it was passed as a [[Money bill]]. Justice Chandrachud noted that while \u201cOrdinary bills can be passed only when they are agreed to by both Houses\u2026 the Constitution carves out a limited role for the Rajya Sabha in the passage of Money Bills.\u201d<ref name=\":15\" /> He noted that in the case of a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha has no amending power, but merely the power to recommend changes \u00a0which are not binding on the Lok Sabha. In other words, any \u00a0change that the Rajya Sabha wishes to seek in the bill can be rejected in its entirety by the Lok Sabha.\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded by affirming that there is a degree of \u201cconstitutional trust\u201d that attaches to a certificate by the Speaker of the House certifying a bill as a Money Bill and is open to judicial review:<blockquote>The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles prevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the Constitution are subject to its norms. No constitutional institution wields absolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason\u2026 Constitutional \u00a0courts have been entrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public functionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional office created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional parameters... If our Constitution has to survive the vicissitudes of political aggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing cynicism about all constitutional institutions, notions of power and authority must give way to duties and compliance with the rule of law<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud embarked on an analysis of the origins and rationale of bicameralism to conclude:<blockquote>Bicameralism, when entrenched as a principle in a constitutional democracy, acts as a check against the abuse of power by constitutional means or its use in an oppressive manner. As a subset of the constitutional principle of division of power, bicameralism is mainly a safeguard against the abuse of the constitutional and political process. A bicameral national parliament can hold the government accountable and can check or restrain the misuse of government power. Among its other roles is that of representing local state units, acting as a body of expert review, and providing representation for diverse socio-economic interests or ethno-cultural minorities.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>After embarking on a comparative analysis of bicameralism across the world, Justice Chandrachud grounded Indian bicameralism in both a commitment to a federal polity as well as participative governance to hold that the Rajya Sabha is a \u201csymbol against majoritarianism\u201d.\n\nHe extensively analysed Article 110 of the Indian Constitution and emphasized that any bill within the ambit of Article 110 must contain \u201conly provisions\u201d dealing with the matter specified therein. Laying emphasis on the use of the words \u201cif\u201d and \u201conly\u201d within the provision, he cautioned that judges \u201ccannot rewrite the Constitution, particularly where it is contrary to both text, context and intent.\u201d He noted that to allow bills that traverse outside the scope of Article 110 to be passed as money Bills would have \u201cconsequences in terms of the nature of the Bill and the legislative participation of the Rajya Sabha,\u201d and \u201creduce bicameralism to an illusion.\u201d He held:<blockquote>A Bill, to be a Money Bill, must contain only provisions which fall within the ambit of the matters mentioned in Article 110\u2026The Lok Sabha cannot introduce and pass a legislative measure in the garb of a Money Bill, which could otherwise have been amended or rejected by the Rajya Sabha. Bicameralism is a founding value of our democracy. It is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Introduction and passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, which does not qualify to be a Money Bill under Article 110(1) of the Constitution, is plainly unconstitutional\u2026 Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill has bypassed the constitutional authority of the Rajya Sabha. The passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill is an abuse of the constitutional process. It deprived the Rajya Sabha from altering the provisions of the Bill by carrying out amendments.. Superseding the authority of the Rajya Sabha is in conflict with the constitutional scheme and the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It constitutes a fraud on the Constitution\u2026 This debasement of a democratic institution cannot be allowed to pass. Institutions are crucial to democracy. Debasing them can only cause a peril to democratic structures.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>One academician wrote shortly thereafter that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s reading of the constitutional provision and assessment of the Aadhaar Act upheld \u201cthe delicate balance of bicameralism\u201d which lies at the heart of India\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/the-aadhaar-judgment-and-the-constitution-iii-on-the-money-bill-guest-post/|title=The Aadhaar Judgment and the Constitution \u2013 III: On the Money Bill (Guest Post)|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2018-10-01|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Individual, State and Identity'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment also analysed the intersection between identity and individuals. The dissent was noted for the emphasis on the protection of individual identity. Emphasising on the plurality of identities of an individual, he observed that:<blockquote>Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a means of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also offered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not have possessed one at all... Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity is expressed and the right not to be identified. That concept is now \u201cflipped\u201d so that identification through identifiers becomes the only form of identity in the time of database governance. This involves a radical transformation in the position of the individual\u2026Identity is a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes a multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards. The technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and infringes the right if an individual to identify himself/herself through a chosen means.

It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity\u2026From reading the judgments, in this case, Dr Chandrachud J, in my respectful view, demonstrated a greater sensitivity to the issues of privacy and freedom that is not as evident in the judgments of the majority of the other judges who delivered concurring judgments.

It is clear to us that the majority dictum in K.S.

Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/dissent-not-anti-national-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-89239|title=Dissent Not Anti-National excerpts/ Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture 2020|last=Legal|first=India|date=2020-02-22|website=India Legal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-antinational-hurts-ethos-of/1735088|title=Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/dissent-a-safety-valve-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/74156371.cms|title=Dissent a safety valve: Justice Chandrachud|last=Feb 16|first=PTI {{!}} Updated:|last2=2020|website=Pune Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20|last3=Ist|first3=08:07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindu-india-and-a-muslim-indiajustice-chandrachud-152796|title='The Framers of Constitution Rejected The Notion of a Hindu India And a Muslim India':Justice Chandrachud [Read Full Text Of Speech]|last=NETWORK|first=LIVELAW NEWS|date=2020-02-16|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as a plea to protect the right to dissent in a free and democratic society.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian judge}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix    = Hon'ble Dr. Justice\n| name                = Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud\n| honorific-suffix    = \n| image               = File:Justice D.Y.

Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>One expert on constitutional law welcomed the decision<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/the-supreme-courts-right-to-privacy-judgment-i-foundations/|title=The Supreme Court\u2019s Right to Privacy Judgment \u2013 I: Foundations|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2017-08-27|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as \u201ca historic and landmark verdict of our times\u201d which \u201cwill have a profound impact upon our legal and constitutional landscape for years to come.\u201d He stated that the:<blockquote>\u2026judgment deserves to be a landmark, not only in the annals of Indian constitutional jurisprudence, but across the world.

He held that:<blockquote>Free speech cannot be gagged for fear of the mob\u2026Political freedoms impose a restraining influence on the state by carving out an area in which the state shall not interfere. Hence, these freedoms are perceived to impose obligations of restraint on the state. But, apart from imposing \u2018negative\u2019 restraints on the state these freedoms impose a positive mandate as well. In its capacity as a public authority enforcing the rule of law, the state must ensure that conditions in which these freedoms flourish are maintained.

A framework of environmental governance committed to the rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution.

The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance.

This approach, with respect fails to notice the critical distinction between an enactment of a competent legislature and an ordinance.

It was observed that he had to follow the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except when the matter was related to police, public order and land. It was also held that by virtue of Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor could, in the case of any disagreement between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor, refer \u2018exceptional\u2019 matters to the President seeking his opinion. In such cases, the decision of the President would be final.

Justice Chandrachud emphasized on the obligation of the Lieutenant Governor to abide by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government and observed that the interpretation that aids the basic features of representative governance and the cabinet form of government should be adopted. He held:<blockquote>\u2026in defining the ambit of the constitutional powers entrusted to the Council of Ministers for the NCT and their relationship with Lieutenant Governor as a delegate of the President, the Court cannot be unmindful of the constitutional importance which has to be assigned to representative government. Representative government is a hallmark of a Constitution which is wedded to democracy for it is through a democratic form of governance that the aspirations of those who elect their representatives are met.</blockquote>\n\n==== The Floor test as a means of ensuring collective responsibility ====\nJustice Chandrachud authored a judgment with far reaching consequences in the political sphere in Shivraj Singh Chouhan. v. Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-373058.pdf|title=MP Floor test Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud held that the Governor\u2019s exercise of power to convene the legislative assembly for a floor test during an ongoing session of the assembly was \u201clegitimate to the purpose of ensuring that the norm of collective responsibility is duly preserved\u201d. He accepted the submission that the Governor commands the power to order a floor test if the Governor has \u2013 based on \u201cobjective material\u201d \u2013 reasons to believe that the government has lost its majority. Significantly, he noted that the power of the Governor is not unbridled in the following terms:<blockquote>Where the exercise of the discretion by the Governor to call a floor test is challenged before the court, it is not immune from judicial review. The court is entitled to determine whether in calling for the floor test, the Governor did so on the basis of objective material and reasons \u00a0which were relevant and germane to the exercise of the power. The exercise of such a power is not intended to destabilize or displace a democratically elected government accountable to the legislative assembly and collectively responsible to it.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>In a first of its kind observation, Justice Chandrachud also noted the state of politics in the country and called for changes to strengthen the nature of the Indian democratic system in the following terms:<blockquote>The spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations does little credit to the state our democratic politics. It is an unfortunate reflection of the confidence \u00a0which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of the politics to lure away persons from rival camps\u2026 It is best that courts maintain an arm\u2019s length from the sordid tales of political life. In defining constitutional principle, however, this Court must be conscious of the position on the ground as admitted by Counsel of both sides and an effort has to be made to the extent possible to ensure that democratic values prevail.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Affirmative Action ===\nJustice Chandrachud has authored numerous judgments on affirmative action in India.

Justice Chandrachud held that the \u201cwithdrawal of civil benefits flowed as a logical result of the validation of a claim to belong to a group or category for whom the reservation is intended\u201d and that \u201cthe selection of ineligible persons is a manifestation of a systematic failure and has deleterious effects on good governance.\u201d Observing that the governing state legislation explicitly specified the consequences of relying upon a false caste certificate, the Court held that recourse to the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 would not be justified. In the same vein, Justice Chandrachud observed that where there was a statutory bar to conferring benefits on the basis of a false certificate, administrative circulars and government resolutions, being subservient to legislative mandate, would not be permitted to cure the defect of a false caste certificate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/appointment-secured-fraudulent-caste-certificates-void-ab-initio-153836|title=Appointment Secured On The Basis Of A Fraudulent Caste Certificate Is Void Ab Initio: SC [Read Order]|last=Kini|first=Ashok|date=2020-03-14|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial and Insurance Law ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored opinions in several important commercial disputes and emphasized the principles of certainty and objectivity in the area of commercial law.

The dispute concerned the alleged addition of certain bidding criteria ''after the last date for bidding''.\u00a0 In upholding the decisions taken by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, Justice Chandrachud noted that the\u00a0 \u00a0additional criteria had only been proposed by the regulator as an agenda item, but was never subsequently adopted. He also observed that when a tender is challenged by a bidder, the dispute remains solely between the bidder and the regulator, and the regulator\u2019s treatment of other bids that have no bearing on the disputed bid cannot be used to allege a case of arbitrariness against the regulator\u2019s actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/sc-dismisses-adani-gas-plea-against-piped-gas-distribution-award/1741786|title=SC dismisses Adani Gas'' plea against piped gas distribution award|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cgd-authorisation-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-of-adani-gas-imc/1871031/|title=CGD authorisation: Supreme Court dismisses appeals of Adani Gas, IMC|date=2020-02-18|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nJustice Chandrachud also authored a judgment governing the liquidation of Super Bazar. The once-iconic Co-Operative Society had fallen on hard times and Writers and Publishers had won the bid to revive Super Bazar under a court regulated recovery scheme. However, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found several accounting irregularities in the management of Super Bazar by Writers and Publishers. \u00a0Justice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment held that it would be against the first principles of insolvency if a resolution applicant were to be refunded their investment after a failed revival effort. His opinion directed that Super Bazar\u2019s assets be handed over to the official liquidator and disposed of in accordance with the statutory order of preferences.\n\n'''''Insurance Law'''''\n\nJustice Chandrachud has authored significant opinions regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts. In one such decision,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/25167/25167_2016_Judgement_24-Apr-2019.pdf|title=Insurance Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a claim was filed by the wife of the deceased who while riding his motorcycle, experienced pain in the chest and shoulder, suffered a heart attack and fell from the motorcycle.

Justice Chandrachud noted that the system of adequate disclosures helps to narrow down the gap of information asymmetries between the parties and helps the insurers to assess their risk appetite. He held:<blockquote>Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries</blockquote>In a widely reported judgment,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/death-malaria-mosquito-bite-accident-supreme-court|title=Is Death due to Malaria from Mosquito Bite a Death due to Accident?

He referred to the World Health Organization\u2019s World Malaria Report 2018 and noted that in a country severely afflicted with Malaria, the mosquito bite was neither unexpected nor unforeseen and therefore, death caused by a mosquito bite would not be covered by the insurance policy.\n\n=== Others ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored judgments on access to justice and the commitment to a transparent judicial system.

He held:<blockquote>The risks which the use of Aadhaar \u201cfor any purpose\u201d carries is that when it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private entities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that connects the cell phone with geo-location data, one\u2019s presence and movement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle consumption with medical records. This starts a \u201ccausal link\u201d between information \u00a0which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. Thus, <u>linking Aadhaar with different databases</u> carries the potential of being profiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also carries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by affecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create co-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected\u2026 When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, ''it becomes a bridge across discreet data silos'', which allows anyone with access to this information to re-construct a profile of an individual\u2019s life.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>At the time when the case was being heard before the Supreme Court, whistleblowers\u00a0had warned of the possible implications of the infrastructure in creating a surveillance state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/aadhaar-is-mass-surveillance-system-will-lead-to-civil-death-for-indians-edward-snowden-1319121-2018-08-20|title=Aadhaar is mass surveillance system, will lead to civil death for Indians: Edward Snowden|last=DelhiAugust 20|first=India Today Tech New|last2=August 20|first2=2018UPDATED:|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21|last3=Ist|first3=2018 16:25}}</ref> Following the judgment, academicians documented the growth in state surveillance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/news/the-aadhaar-card-cybersecurity-issues-with-indias-biometric-experiment/|title=The Aadhaar Card: Cybersecurity Issues with India's Biometric Experiment|date=2019-05-09|website=The Henry M.

He held that the absence of consent within the Act, the extent of information disclosed, the expansive scope of the term \u201cbiometrics\u201d, the burden placed upon the individual to update her own biometrics, and lack of access to the record, cumulatively constitute a serious infringement of privacy.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== ''Proportionality'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud drew from academic literature as well as jurisprudence across national frontiers on the proportionality standard and held that the burden to justify that the method adopted lies on the state and it must be demonstrated that the chosen method is both necessary and the least intrusive manner of achieving the stated objective. Circumspect of the Aadhaar infrastructure in plugging loopholes in welfare leakages, he held that:<blockquote>The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and extent of the State\u2019s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the rights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be proportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging of welfare leakage and better targeting\u2026 \u2026 by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar program treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the State to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime or an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief and judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which infringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the Constitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the State\u2026 the state has failed to demonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than biometric authentication will not sub serve its purposes.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>As part of his analysis, he noted the potential of the Aadhaar infrastructure to further bread inequality and the burden on the state to remedy any potential failings ''prior'' to the implementation of a nation wide infrastructure. He held:<blockquote>Technological error would result in authentication failures. The concerns raised by UIDAI ought to have been resolved before the implementation of the Aadhaar project. Poor connectivity in rural India was a major concern. The majority of the Indian population lives in rural areas. Even a small percentage of error results in a population of crores being affected. Denial of subsidies and benefits to them due to the infirmities of biometric technology is a threat to good governance and social parity\u2026 No failure rate in the provision of social welfare benefits can be regarded as acceptable. Basic entitlements in matters such as food grain, can brook no error. To deny food is to lead a family to destitution, malnutrition and even death.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== ''Money Bill'' ====\nConsidered the \u2018heart\u2019 of his dissent,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ijlpp.com/the-aadhaar-judgment-legal-complications-of-a-money-bill/|title=THE AADHAAR JUDGMENT : LEGAL COMPLICATIONS OF A MONEY BILL|date=2018-10-23|website=THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> , Justice Chandrachud struck down of the entire Act as it was passed as a [[Money bill]]. Justice Chandrachud noted that while \u201cOrdinary bills can be passed only when they are agreed to by both Houses\u2026 the Constitution carves out a limited role for the Rajya Sabha in the passage of Money Bills.\u201d<ref name=\":15\" /> He noted that in the case of a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha has no amending power, but merely the power to recommend changes \u00a0which are not binding on the Lok Sabha. In other words, any \u00a0change that the Rajya Sabha wishes to seek in the bill can be rejected in its entirety by the Lok Sabha.\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded by affirming that there is a degree of \u201cconstitutional trust\u201d that attaches to a certificate by the Speaker of the House certifying a bill as a Money Bill and is open to judicial review:<blockquote>The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles prevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the Constitution are subject to its norms. No constitutional institution wields absolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason\u2026 Constitutional \u00a0courts have been entrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public functionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional office created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional parameters... If our Constitution has to survive the vicissitudes of political aggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing cynicism about all constitutional institutions, notions of power and authority must give way to duties and compliance with the rule of law<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud embarked on an analysis of the origins and rationale of bicameralism to conclude:<blockquote>Bicameralism, when entrenched as a principle in a constitutional democracy, acts as a check against the abuse of power by constitutional means or its use in an oppressive manner. As a subset of the constitutional principle of division of power, bicameralism is mainly a safeguard against the abuse of the constitutional and political process. A bicameral national parliament can hold the government accountable and can check or restrain the misuse of government power. Among its other roles is that of representing local state units, acting as a body of expert review, and providing representation for diverse socio-economic interests or ethno-cultural minorities.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>After embarking on a comparative analysis of bicameralism across the world, Justice Chandrachud grounded Indian bicameralism in both a commitment to a federal polity as well as participative governance to hold that the Rajya Sabha is a \u201csymbol against majoritarianism\u201d.\n\nHe extensively analysed Article 110 of the Indian Constitution and emphasized that any bill within the ambit of Article 110 must contain \u201conly provisions\u201d dealing with the matter specified therein. Laying emphasis on the use of the words \u201cif\u201d and \u201conly\u201d within the provision, he cautioned that judges \u201ccannot rewrite the Constitution, particularly where it is contrary to both text, context and intent.\u201d He noted that to allow bills that traverse outside the scope of Article 110 to be passed as money Bills would have \u201cconsequences in terms of the nature of the Bill and the legislative participation of the Rajya Sabha,\u201d and \u201creduce bicameralism to an illusion.\u201d He held:<blockquote>A Bill, to be a Money Bill, must contain only provisions which fall within the ambit of the matters mentioned in Article 110\u2026The Lok Sabha cannot introduce and pass a legislative measure in the garb of a Money Bill, which could otherwise have been amended or rejected by the Rajya Sabha. Bicameralism is a founding value of our democracy. It is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Introduction and passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, which does not qualify to be a Money Bill under Article 110(1) of the Constitution, is plainly unconstitutional\u2026 Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill has bypassed the constitutional authority of the Rajya Sabha. The passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill is an abuse of the constitutional process. It deprived the Rajya Sabha from altering the provisions of the Bill by carrying out amendments.. Superseding the authority of the Rajya Sabha is in conflict with the constitutional scheme and the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It constitutes a fraud on the Constitution\u2026 This debasement of a democratic institution cannot be allowed to pass. Institutions are crucial to democracy. Debasing them can only cause a peril to democratic structures.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>One academician wrote shortly thereafter that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s \u201cmeticulous\u201d reading of the constitutional provision and assessment of the Aadhaar Act upheld \u201cthe delicate balance of bicameralism\u201d which lies at the heart of India\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/the-aadhaar-judgment-and-the-constitution-iii-on-the-money-bill-guest-post/|title=The Aadhaar Judgment and the Constitution \u2013 III: On the Money Bill (Guest Post)|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2018-10-01|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Individual, State and Identity'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment is also regarded as undertaking a nuanced approach to identity and individuals. The dissent was noted for the emphasis on the protection of individual identity. Emphasising on the plurality of identities of an individual, he observed that:<blockquote>Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a means of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also offered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not have possessed one at all... Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity is expressed and the right not to be identified. That concept is now \u201cflipped\u201d so that identification through identifiers becomes the only form of identity in the time of database governance. This involves a radical transformation in the position of the individual\u2026Identity is a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes a multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards. The technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and infringes the right if an individual to identify himself/herself through a chosen means. Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which facilitates a prof of identity. It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity.</blockquote>He analysed the intersection between law and technology and observed that the biometric technology \u201cwhich is the core of the Aadhaar programme is probabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures.\u201d He observed that:<blockquote>Dignity and the rights of individuals cannot be made to depend on algorithms or probabilities. Constitutional guarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes of technology.</blockquote>\n\n==== Aftermath of the Dissent ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s dissent has received academic analysis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/aadhaar-verdict-justice-dy-chandrachud-hailed-for-historic-dissent|title=Justice DY Chandrachud\u2019s \u2018historic dissent\u2019 on Aadhaar verdict hailed|website=National Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livewire.thewire.in/politics/chandrachud-dissent-aadhaar/|title=How Justice Chandrachud's Aadhaar Dissent Upholds the Spirit of the Indian Constitution|last=Tweet|last2=WhatsApp|date=2018-09-28|website=Live Wire|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> and has led some scholars to write that the dissent ranks alongside the greatest dissents in the history of the Indian Supreme Court.

It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity\u2026From reading the judgments, in this case, Dr Chandrachud J, in my respectful view, demonstrated a greater sensitivity to the issues of privacy and freedom that is not as evident in the judgments of the majority of the other judges who delivered concurring judgments. His Lordship had a clear-eyed view of the dangers of a state or anyone having control over one\u2019s personal information and generally, I preferred his approach to the issue over that of the other judges\u2026 I must also say that in the application of the standard I prefer the reasoning of Dr Chandrachud J to that of the majority.</blockquote>One constitutional law expert observed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/the-afterlife-of-the-aadhaar-dissent-the-jamaican-supreme-court-strikes-down-a-national-biometric-identification-system/|title=The Afterlife of the Aadhaar Dissent: The Jamaican Supreme Court Strikes Down a National Biometric Identification System|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2019-04-13|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> that:<blockquote>\u2026a dissent is not limited to a footnote in the judicial lore of a nation, waiting for the years to pass by until the \u201cintelligence of a future day\u201d dawns.

Noting deficiencies in the reasoning of the majority in the Aadhaar judgment and referring the question of law on Money Bills to a Bench of a higher strength, he stated:<blockquote>Upon an extensive examination of the matter, we notice that the majority in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced the nature of the impugned enactment without first delineating the scope of Article 110(1) and principles for interpretation or the repercussions of such process. It is clear to us that the majority dictum in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect of the word \u2018only\u2019 in Article 110(1) and offers little guidance on the repercussions of a finding when some of the provisions of an enactment passed as a \u201cMoney Bill\u201d do not conform to Article 110(1)(a) to (g)\u2026 Being a Bench of equal strength as that in K.S.

He stated:<blockquote>\u2026the employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free speech which violates the rule of law and detracts from the constitutional vision of a pluralist society\u2026The true test of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution\u2026A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the state apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation. Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/dissent-not-anti-national-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-89239|title=Dissent Not Anti-National excerpts/ Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture 2020|last=Legal|first=India|date=2020-02-22|website=India Legal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-antinational-hurts-ethos-of/1735088|title=Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/dissent-a-safety-valve-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/74156371.cms|title=Dissent a safety valve: Justice Chandrachud|last=Feb 16|first=PTI {{!}} Updated:|last2=2020|website=Pune Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20|last3=Ist|first3=08:07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindu-india-and-a-muslim-indiajustice-chandrachud-152796|title='The Framers of Constitution Rejected The Notion of a Hindu India And a Muslim India':Justice Chandrachud [Read Full Text Of Speech]|last=NETWORK|first=LIVELAW NEWS|date=2020-02-16|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as a plea to protect the right to dissent in a free and democratic society.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "name_user": "Charmanderrulez", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor grammatical changes made and one paragraph modified.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud"}

AdZU began in 1912 as Escuela Catolica, a parochial school run by [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Jesuits]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.adzu.edu.ph/about-adzu/history |title=The History of ADZU |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University |accessdate=2009-05-15 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is the second oldest Jesuit school in the [[Philippines]] and the second Jesuit school to be named Ateneo. It initially offered primary and secondary education for boys. It became a college in 1952 and a university in August 2001. It operates on two campuses, La Purisima Street with the tertiary and senior high school divisions and [[Barangay]] [[Tumaga]], outside [[Zamboanga City]] proper, with the junior high school and grade school units.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-war Ateneo===\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University began in 1912 as ''Escuela Catolica'', a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits at the old site of the Immaculate Conception Church across from the Sunken Garden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adzu.edu.ph/adzu-history/|title=About AdZU (History)|website=Ateneo de Zamboanga University}}</ref> Fr. Manuel M. Sauras, S.J., was the first director and served in that capacity up to 1926. Escuela Catolica served as the parochial school of the Immaculada Concepcion Parish headed by Fr. Miguel Saderra Mata, S.J. Classes were held on the ground floor of the rectory of the parish, which was adjacent to Plaza Pershing. While the curriculum was similar to that of the public elementary school, the Spanish Jesuits emphasized religious teaching alongside quality education. Catholic education later became a factor in the decision of the Jesuits to open a school that was empowered to issue the ''titulo oficial'' upon completion of studies.\n\nIn 1916, the Escuela Catolica expanded and became the Ateneo Elementary School. Its grade school opened that year with seven grades. The school name was changed to Ateneo de Zamboanga when its high school opened in 1928. High school classes were held on the top floor of the three-story Ateneo building along I. Magno corners P. Reyes and Urdaneta streets. The building was the Mindanao Theater, now the site of the City Theater. Five lay teachers and the Jesuit director made up the faculty. The elementary school occupied the lower floors. The first high school students graduated from Ateneo in 1932. The ten young male graduates belonged to Zamboanga City's cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, one of whom was Roseller T. Lim who would become the first Zamboangue\u00f1o senator of the Philippines.\n\nThe American Jesuits took over from the Spanish Jesuits in 1930, with Fr. Thomas J. Murray, S.J., as the first American director. In 1932 the government gave official recognition to the high school.\n\nIn 1938, AdZU opened night classes in commerce and pre-law, thus pioneering its expansion to college, later interrupted by World War II. Pre-war Ateneo expanded with an enrollment of 230 in the grade school and 376 in the high school under Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J. A Zamboangue\u00f1o and a product of Escuela Catolica, Fr. Salvador was the first Filipino director of AdZU. In 1938 a library was built on the first floor of the Knights of Columbus building. A fa\u00e7ade, an auditorium, and an annex were also built. Fr. John Shinn, S.J., was appointed headmaster of the grade school and Fr. Francis X. Clark, S.J., became the principal and dean of discipline of the high school.\n\nThe school was closed during World War II when the Japanese used it as a public school until it was shelled and bombed by American forces on March 8 and 9 in 1945, before the liberation of the city.\n\n===Post-war Ateneo===\nThe high school and intermediate classes (grades 5 and 6) reopened in 1946, in a [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]]-[[sawali]] building on a new site outside of the [[poblacion]] called the Jardin de Chino near Camino Nuevo. It was providential that shortly before the outbreak of the war, Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J., had bought 18 adjoining lots in Jardin de Chino on Bailen Street (now La Purisima Street). In 1947 he bought an additional 1.5 hectares along Camino Nuevo St. adjoining the Bailen St. property to bring to a total of 4.3 hectares the La Purisima campus. Together with Frs. Kyran B. Egan and Cesar E. Maravilla, he reopened high school classes.\n\nIn 1949, Ateneo became independent of the Jesuit mission in Zamboanga, separating itself from the Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was officially recognized as a Jesuit school apart from the parish. The post liberation years were a period of rapid physical, curricular, and enrollment expansion of the school. By 1949, AdZU underwent a major make-over. A solid structure of fine wood replaced the nipa-and-sawali classrooms. The gymnasium-auditorium (now Brebeuf Gymnasium) was constructed in 1950, making it the oldest structure on campus today.\n\nA college was established in 1952 and a graduate school in 1976.\n\nIn the years between 1946 and 1952, a total of 2,766 students graduated from high school. The college opened in 1952 with a two-year collegiate program, which offered pre-law courses and a degree in Associate in Arts. The college gradually expanded to include four-year bachelor's programs in the arts, commerce, education, and nursing. In 1956, the college and high school became separate departments.\n\n===Expansion===\nAdZ experienced a \u201cbuilding boom\u201d beginning with the completion of the Jesuit Residence in 1959, Sacred Heart Chapel in 1961, Gonzaga Hall in 1964, and Canisius Hall in 1967. In 1972, the two one-storey grade school buildings, Berchmans and Kostka halls, were built. By the mid-70s, basic education was well established with an enrolment reaching 381 students in the grade school. In 1976, higher education expanded to include the graduate school which opened an MBA course, the first graduate program in business administration in Region IX. Soon after, other master's degrees followed: public administration, nursing, guidance and counselling, and education. These programs were offered under the guidance of Fr. Ernesto A. Carretero, S.J., the first president elected by the Board of Trustees of AdZ.\n\nIn the years that followed, more changes and developments took place. Campion Hall and Bellarmine Hall were built in 1979 and 1980. The Fr. Jose Ma. Rosauro, S.J., Center was finished in 1986. The Learning Resource Center was inaugurated in 1987 to accommodate the library, book center, audio-visual unit, and various offices. Fr. Carretero, S.J., obtained the PAASCU accreditation of the high school in 1975, the liberal arts and commerce in 1981, and education, nursing, and the grade school in 1982. AdZ attained Level III in the accreditation of these colleges, the highest rank given to tertiary schools in the Philippines at that time.\n\nIn 1984, girls were accepted for the first time in the grade school. Twenty-two girls were part of the grade six graduating class in 1992. They became the first batch of girls to study at the Ateneo High School in 1992.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. Kreutz (1989-2006)===\n[[File:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Facade April 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|The facade of the Bellarmine-Campion building facing La Purisima St.]]\nFr. Carretero, S.J., and after 1989 Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., Ateneo presidents, sought university status for the school. By this time and into the mid-90s the school had added undergraduate programs including accountancy, arts and sciences, business management, and computer science.\n\nIn 1994, a group of Zamboanga-based doctors entered into a consortium with the Ateneo de Zamboanga under Fr. Kreutz's presidency to establish a medical school named Zamboanga Medical School Foundation (ZMSF). It was on the La Purisima campus. In 2004, ZMSF was turned over to Ateneo. The medical school became the Ateneo de Zamboanga University School of Medicine. Partnering with the universities of Calgary, Laos, Nepal, and Cambodia, the School of Medicine uses problem-based learning and community-based approach to medical practice with emphasis on serving communities in Western Mindanao.\n\n====University status====\nOn August 20, 2001, AdZ was officially declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). In the same year it was granted autonomous status by CHED, making Ateneo de Zamboanga University (AdZU) one of only thirty higher education institutions in the Philippines, and the only one in Western Mindanao, to be granted full deregulation and autonomy. The new College building and the Multi-Purpose Covered Courts were inaugurated in 2001.\n\n====New campus in Tumaga====\nOn July 31, 2005, groundbreaking was held for the new high school building in Savanah, Tumaga, Zamboanga City. Fr. Kreutz's 18-year presidency came to a close together with the completion of the new campus in Tumaga, which was later named Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., campus. The high school was transferred to this new site in 2006 for school year 2006\u20132007.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. Moreno (2006-2013)===\nOn October 11, 2006, Fr. Antonio F. Moreno, S.J., was elected as the second president of the University, replacing Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J. He assumed office on May 21, 2007, and was officially installed on September 22, 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, AdZU and Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan launched the Xavier University College of Law \u2013 Zamboanga on 25 June 2011. The College of Law is in a new four-storey building named in honor of Fr. Manuel Ma. Sauras, S.J. Sauras Hall is also home to the new university cafeteria.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe school's Sacred Heart chapel, built in 1961, was replaced after 50 years by a new Spanish-colonial University Church of the Sacred Heart in time for the university's centennial in 2012.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. San Juan (2013-present)===\nWhen in 2013 Fr. Moreno became Provincial Superior of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus, the University Board of Trustees elected Fr. [[Karel San Juan|Karel S.

As Fr. San Juan was in his final year of Jesuit spiritual formation, he did not assume the presidency until October 8, 2013.\n\nGroundbreaking for a new grade school building at the Tumaga campus was held on July 30, 2013; the new building was opened on June 13, 2015. Plans for this campus include construction of an auditorium, an amphitheater, sports facilities, and a chapel which will replace the chapel in the high school building.<ref>{{Citation\n |url=http://www.adzu.edu.ph/07/tour/index.php \n |title=Adzu Campus La purisima \n |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University \n |accessdate=2009-05-15 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429030947/http://www.adzu.edu.ph/07/tour/index.php \n |archivedate=2009-04-29 \n}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.adzu.edu.ph/07/academicUnits/?pageTitle=Academics&sublink=High+School&cat_sublink=Description |title=AdZU Tumaga Campus |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University |accessdate=2009-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505230327/http://www.adzu.edu.ph/07/academicUnits/?pageTitle=Academics&sublink=High+School&cat_sublink=Description |archivedate=2009-05-05 }}</ref>\n\n====Senior High School====\nOn June 13, 2016, the Senior High School unit was officially inaugurated at the Fr Salvador Eusebio Campus, La Purisima St, Zamboanga City.

William Kreutz, S.J., is home to the Junior High School and Grade School units.\n\nThe campus initially opened as the home of the Ateneo de Zamboanga University High School, which needed more space to expand than the constraints of the Main Campus could allow. Eventually, the Grade School was moved to this campus too in 2015, and the campus was given purpose as the basic education center of the University.\n\nAside from the junior high school and grade school buildings, the campus also includes a soccer field, a multi-purpose covered court, and a playground.<gallery>\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Grade School.jpg|A courtyard in the Grade School complex\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Junior High School.jpg|A walkway at the Junior High School building\n</gallery>\n\n=== Lantaka Campus ===\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University Lantaka Campus is situated along the historic developed coastline of Zamboanga City.

The name of the school is written on the bottom half.\n\nIn the circular field is the shield. The red and yellow stripes are derived from the coat of arms of the family of O\u00f1az, the maternal line of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]]. In the center are two wolves and a food pot. These are of the medallion of the family of Loyola, the paternal line of St. Ignatius of Loyola. This medallion stands for the generosity for which the house of Loyola was well known. The cross on the upper right portion of the shield symbolizes the Christian character of the Ateneo, while the [[vinta]] is meant to be representative of the various cultural communities of the South Western Philippines where the school is located. On the bottom left are the book and torch, traditional symbols of education.\n\nAbove the shield is the sunburst, in which the monogram of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) \u2014 JHS is positioned with the cross above and three nails below. The \"JHS\" wordmark is derived from the Greek \u0399\u1f28\u03a3, the first letters of Jesus' name. Emanating from the name of Jesus are blue and white rays signifying grace for all.\n\n===Name===\nThe name Ateneo is the Spanish form of ''Athen\u00e6um'', which the [[Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]] defines as the name of \"the first educational institution in Rome\" where \"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, was where \"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\" Athen\u00e6um is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning.\n\nThe Society of Jesus has established [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|16 schools]] in the Philippines since 1590 and named nine of them Ateneo. Ateneo de Zamboanga was the second school named Ateneo in 1916. Over the years, the name \"Ateneo\" has been recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines.\n\n==Student life==\nThe units of AdZU together have dozens of student organizations that cater to a wide variety of preferences, ranging from advocacy and humanitarian groups such as institutional chapters of [[Rotary International]]'s Interact to niche interests such as debate and worship music.\n\nIn addition, the different Schools (including undergraduate, professional, and basic education schools) have ''Academic Organizations'' (AOs) that manage the specific needs of students in a given School. These AOs are instrumental in rallying students from these schools together for matters of interest and importance, as well as organizing teams for sports festivals and other intra-University activities.\n\n=== Athletics ===\nThe college varsity teams compete in the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA), and the grade school and high school varsity teams participate in the Private Schools of Zamboanga City Athletic Association (PSZCAA).\n\nAdZU holds a school-wide annual sportsfest called \"Ateneo Fiesta,\" a week-long event beginning in the last week of November. Most of the high school and college competitors in the Fiesta are varsity athletes preparing for competition in sports events on the PRISAA agenda. The Fiesta itself is now considered the most important event of the academic year for student life.\n\n=== Student councils ===\nThe Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Ateneo de Zamboanga University (SMADZU) was the College unit's student government before 2009. Currently in its place is El Consejo Atenista, which was created with the objective of being a more representative student government.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Beacon Magazine of CSIT|url=http://csitao.multiply.com/journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211011655/http://csitao.multiply.com/journal|url-status=dead|publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University|accessdate=2009-05-15|archivedate=2009-12-11}}</ref> The basic education units also have their own student councils; the junior high school student government is called the ''Council of Leaders'', while the senior high school government is called the ''Ateneo Student Executive Council'' (ASEC).

AdZU began in 1912 as Escuela Catolica, a parochial school run by [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Jesuits]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.adzu.edu.ph/about-adzu/history |title=The History of ADZU |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University |accessdate=2009-05-15 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is the second oldest Jesuit school in the [[Philippines]] and the second Jesuit school to be named Ateneo. It initially offered primary and secondary education for boys. It became a college in 1952 and a university in August 2001. It operates on two campuses, La Purisima Street with the tertiary and senior high school divisions and [[Barangay]] [[Tumaga]], outside [[Zamboanga City]] proper, with the junior high school and grade school units.\n\n==History==\n===Pre-war Ateneo===\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University began in 1912 as ''Escuela Catolica'', a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits at the old site of the Immaculate Conception Church across from the Sunken Garden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adzu.edu.ph/adzu-history/|title=About AdZU (History)|website=Ateneo de Zamboanga University}}</ref> Fr. Manuel M. Sauras, S.J., was the first director and served in that capacity up to 1926. Escuela Catolica served as the parochial school of the Immaculada Concepcion Parish headed by Fr. Miguel Saderra Mata, S.J. Classes were held on the ground floor of the rectory of the parish, which was adjacent to Plaza Pershing. While the curriculum was similar to that of the public elementary school, the Spanish Jesuits emphasized religious teaching alongside quality education. Catholic education later became a factor in the decision of the Jesuits to open a school that was empowered to issue the ''titulo oficial'' upon completion of studies.\n\nIn 1916, the Escuela Catolica expanded and became the Ateneo Elementary School. Its grade school opened that year with seven grades. The school name was changed to Ateneo de Zamboanga when its high school opened in 1928. High school classes were held on the top floor of the three-story Ateneo building along I. Magno corners P. Reyes and Urdaneta streets. The building was the Mindanao Theater, now the site of the City Theater. Five lay teachers and the Jesuit director made up the faculty. The elementary school occupied the lower floors. The first high school students graduated from Ateneo in 1932. The ten young male graduates belonged to Zamboanga City's cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, one of whom was Roseller T. Lim who would become the first Zamboangue\u00f1o senator of the Philippines.\n\nThe American Jesuits took over from the Spanish Jesuits in 1930, with Fr. Thomas J. Murray, S.J., as the first American director. In 1932 the government gave official recognition to the high school.\n\nIn 1938, AdZU opened night classes in commerce and pre-law, thus pioneering its expansion to college, later interrupted by World War II. Pre-war Ateneo expanded with an enrollment of 230 in the grade school and 376 in the high school under Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J. A Zamboangue\u00f1o and a product of Escuela Catolica, Fr. Salvador was the first Filipino director of AdZU. In 1938 a library was built on the first floor of the Knights of Columbus building. A fa\u00e7ade, an auditorium, and an annex were also built. Fr. John Shinn, S.J., was appointed headmaster of the grade school and Fr. Francis X. Clark, S.J., became the principal and dean of discipline of the high school.\n\nThe school was closed during World War II when the Japanese used it as a public school until it was shelled and bombed by American forces on March 8 and 9 in 1945, before the liberation of the city.\n\n===Post-war Ateneo===\nThe high school and intermediate classes (grades 5 and 6) reopened in 1946, in a [[Nypa fruticans|nipa]]-[[sawali]] building on a new site outside of the [[poblacion]] called the Jardin de Chino near Camino Nuevo. It was providential that shortly before the outbreak of the war, Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J., had bought 18 adjoining lots in Jardin de Chino on Bailen Street (now La Purisima Street). In 1947 he bought an additional 1.5 hectares along Camino Nuevo St. adjoining the Bailen St. property to bring to a total of 4.3 hectares the La Purisima campus. Together with Frs. Kyran B. Egan and Cesar E. Maravilla, he reopened high school classes.\n\nIn 1949, Ateneo became independent of the Jesuit mission in Zamboanga, separating itself from the Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was officially recognized as a Jesuit school apart from the parish. The post liberation years were a period of rapid physical, curricular, and enrollment expansion of the school. By 1949, AdZU underwent a major make-over. A solid structure of fine wood replaced the nipa-and-sawali classrooms. The gymnasium-auditorium (now Brebeuf Gymnasium) was constructed in 1950, making it the oldest structure on campus today.\n\nA college was established in 1952 and a graduate school in 1976.\n\nIn the years between 1946 and 1952, a total of 2,766 students graduated from high school. The college opened in 1952 with a two-year collegiate program, which offered pre-law courses and a degree in Associate in Arts. The college gradually expanded to include four-year bachelor's programs in the arts, commerce, education, and nursing. In 1956, the college and high school became separate departments.\n\n===Expansion===\nAdZ experienced a \u201cbuilding boom\u201d beginning with the completion of the Jesuit Residence in 1959, Sacred Heart Chapel in 1961, Gonzaga Hall in 1964, and Canisius Hall in 1967. In 1972, the two one-storey grade school buildings, Berchmans and Kostka halls, were built. By the mid-70s, basic education was well established with an enrolment reaching 381 students in the grade school. In 1976, higher education expanded to include the graduate school which opened an MBA course, the first graduate program in business administration in Region IX. Soon after, other master's degrees followed: public administration, nursing, guidance and counselling, and education. These programs were offered under the guidance of Fr. Ernesto A. Carretero, S.J., the first president elected by the Board of Trustees of AdZ.\n\nIn the years that followed, more changes and developments took place. Campion Hall and Bellarmine Hall were built in 1979 and 1980. The Fr. Jose Ma. Rosauro, S.J., Center was finished in 1986. The Learning Resource Center was inaugurated in 1987 to accommodate the library, book center, audio-visual unit, and various offices. Fr. Carretero, S.J., obtained the PAASCU accreditation of the high school in 1975, the liberal arts and commerce in 1981, and education, nursing, and the grade school in 1982. AdZ attained Level III in the accreditation of these colleges, the highest rank given to tertiary schools in the Philippines at that time.\n\nIn 1984, girls were accepted for the first time in the grade school. Twenty-two girls were part of the grade six graduating class in 1992. They became the first batch of girls to study at the Ateneo High School in 1992.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. Kreutz (1989-2006)===\n[[File:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Facade April 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|The facade of the Bellarmine-Campion building facing La Purisima St.]]\nFr. Carretero, S.J., and after 1989 Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., Ateneo presidents, sought university status for the school. By this time and into the mid-90s the school had added undergraduate programs including accountancy, arts and sciences, business management, and computer science.\n\nIn 1994, a group of Zamboanga-based doctors entered into a consortium with the Ateneo de Zamboanga under Fr. Kreutz's presidency to establish a medical school named Zamboanga Medical School Foundation (ZMSF). It was on the La Purisima campus. In 2004, ZMSF was turned over to Ateneo. The medical school became the Ateneo de Zamboanga University School of Medicine. Partnering with the universities of Calgary, Laos, Nepal, and Cambodia, the School of Medicine uses problem-based learning and community-based approach to medical practice with emphasis on serving communities in Western Mindanao.\n\n====University status====\nOn August 20, 2001, AdZ was officially declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). In the same year it was granted autonomous status by CHED, making Ateneo de Zamboanga University (AdZU) one of only thirty higher education institutions in the Philippines, and the only one in Western Mindanao, to be granted full deregulation and autonomy. The new College building and the Multi-Purpose Covered Courts were inaugurated in 2001.\n\n====New campus in Tumaga====\nOn July 31, 2005, groundbreaking was held for the new high school building in Savanah, Tumaga, Zamboanga City. Fr. Kreutz's 18-year presidency came to a close together with the completion of the new campus in Tumaga, which was later named Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., campus. The high school was transferred to this new site in 2006 for school year 2006\u20132007.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. Moreno (2006-2013)===\nIn October 11, 2006, Fr. Antonio F. Moreno, S.J., was elected as the second president of the University, replacing Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J. He assumed office on May 21, 2007, and was officially installed on September 22, 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, AdZU and Xavier University \u2013 Ateneo de Cagayan launched the Xavier University College of Law \u2013 Zamboanga on 25 June 2011. The College of Law is in a new four-storey building named in honor of Fr. Manuel Ma. Sauras, S.J. Sauras Hall is also home to the new university cafeteria.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe school's Sacred Heart chapel, built in 1961, was replaced after 50 years by a new Spanish-colonial University Church of the Sacred Heart in time for the university's centennial in 2012.\n\n===Presidency of Fr. San Juan (2013-present)===\nWhen in 2013 Fr. Moreno became Provincial Superior of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus, the University Board of Trustees elected Fr.

Eusebio Salvador, S.J., houses the undergraduate and graduate schools and the Senior High School unit.\n\nBuildings used as learning spaces include the Bellarmine-Campion building (home to the Bellarmine and Campion halls), the Canisius and Gonzaga halls (collectively colloquially referred to as the C building), the Xavier Hall, the Kostka Hall, and the Francisco Wee Saavedra (FWS) Building. The FWS Building permanently hosts the Senior High School unit, while other buildings are shared by the undergraduate, graduate, and senior high schools.\n\nThe Learning Resource Center on-campus houses the Fr. Jose Bacatan, S.J. library, the University's main library, as well as several important offices and the administration of the Graduate School. The campus also contains two Multi-Purpose Covered Courts, the Backfield, the Bellarmine-Campion Quadrangle, the Jesuit Residences, the Rosauro (JMR) Hall, and the Sauras Hall.<gallery>\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Main Campus April 2019.jpg|The Gonzaga Hall and the Multi-Purpose Covered Court 2\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Main Campus Rear.jpg|Kiosks in front of the Sauras and Xavier Halls, situated beside the campus backfield\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University FWS Building Facade.jpg|The facade of the FWS building\n</gallery>\n\n=== Fr.

William Kreutz, S.J., is home to the Junior High School and Grade School units.\n\nThe campus initially opened as the home of the Ateneo de Zamboanga University High School, which needed more space to expand than the constraints of the Main Campus could allow. Eventually, the Grade School was moved to this campus too in 2015, and the campus was given purpose as the basic education center of the University.\n\nAside from the junior high school and grade school buildings, the campus also includes a soccer field, a multi-purpose covered court, and a playground.<gallery>\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Grade School.jpg|A courtyard in the Grade School complex\nFile:Ateneo de Zamboanga University Junior High School.jpg|A walkway at the Junior High School building\n</gallery>\n\n=== Lantaka Campus ===\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University Lantaka Campus is situated along the historic developed coastline of Zamboanga City.

The name of the school is written on the bottom half.\n\nIn the circular field is the shield. The red and yellow stripes are derived from the coat of arms of the family of O\u00f1az, the maternal line of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]]. In the center are two wolves and a food pot. These are of the medallion of the family of Loyola, the paternal line of St. Ignatius of Loyola. This medallion stands for the generosity for which the house of Loyola was well known. The cross on the upper right portion of the shield symbolizes the Christian character of the Ateneo, while the [[vinta]] is meant to be representative of the various cultural communities of the South Western Philippines where the school is located. On the bottom left are the book and torch, traditional symbols of education.\n\nAbove the shield is the sunburst, in which the monogram of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) \u2014 JHS is positioned with the cross above and three nails below. The \"JHS\" wordmark is derived from the Greek \u0399\u1f28\u03a3, the first letters of Jesus' name. Emanating from the name of Jesus are blue and white rays signifying grace for all.\n\n===Name===\nThe name Ateneo is the Spanish form of ''Athen\u00e6um'', which the [[Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]] defines as the name of \"the first educational institution in Rome\" where \"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, was where \"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\" Athen\u00e6um is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning.\n\nThe Society of Jesus has established [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|16 schools]] in the Philippines since 1590 and named nine of them Ateneo. Ateneo de Zamboanga was the second school named Ateneo in 1916. Over the years, the name \"Ateneo\" has been recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines.\n\n==Student life==\nThe units of AdZU together have dozens of student organizations that cater to a wide variety of preferences, ranging from advocacy and humanitarian groups such as institutional chapters of [[Rotary International]]'s Interact to niche interests such as debate and worship music.\n\nIn addition, the different Schools (including undergraduate, professional, and basic education schools) have ''Academic Organizations'' (AOs) that manage the specific needs of students in a given School. These AOs are instrumental in rallying students from these schools together for matters of interest and importance, as well as organizing teams for sports festivals and other intra-University activities.\n\n=== Athletics ===\nThe college varsity teams compete in the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA), and the grade school and high school varsity teams participate in the Private Schools of Zamboanga City Athletic Association (PSZCAA).\n\nAdZU holds a school-wide annual sportsfest called \"Ateneo Fiesta,\" a week-long event beginning in the last week of November. Most of the high school and college competitors in the Fiesta are varsity athletes preparing for competition in sports events on the PRISAA agenda. The Fiesta itself is now considered the most important event of the academic year for student life.\n\n=== Student councils ===\nThe Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Ateneo de Zamboanga University (SMADZU) was the College unit's student government before 2009. Currently in its place is El Consejo Atenista, which was created with the objective of being a more representative student government.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Beacon Magazine of CSIT|url=http://csitao.multiply.com/journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211011655/http://csitao.multiply.com/journal|url-status=dead|publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University|accessdate=2009-05-15|archivedate=2009-12-11}}</ref> The basic education units also have their own student councils; the junior high school student government is called the ''Council of Leaders'', while the senior high school government is called the ''Ateneo Student Executive Council'' (ASEC).

The existence of phenylsodium was originally proposed by [[August_Kekul\u00e9|Kekul\u00e9]] after observing the formation of [[sodium benzoate]] in the reaction of [[bromobenzene]] with [[sodium]] under [[carbon dioxide]]. The solid compound was first isolated by Acree in 1903. The reaction products of phenylsodium with various chemicals are nearly identical to those of [[Grignard_Reagent|Grignard reagents]], but the Grignard reaction is far more commonly used likely due to the higher reactivity of phenylsodium and safety issues associated with the use of metallic sodium as a starting material.

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

They additionally contend that epigraphical, genetic, and osteological evidence supports their claims. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\nThe idea was first suggested by Jos\u00e9 Melgar, who discovered the first [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal head]] at Hueyapan (now [[Tres Zapotes]]) in 1862 and subsequently published two papers that attributed this head to a \"Negro race.\"<ref>Stirling, p. 2, who cites Melgar (1869) and Melgar (1871).</ref> The view was espoused in the early 20th century by [[Leo Wiener]] and others.<ref name=\"Ortizde\">Ort\u00edz de Montellano, Bernard & Gabriel Haslip Viera & Warren Barbour 1997</ref> Some modern proponents such as [[Ivan Van Sertima]] and Clyde Ahmad Winters have identified the Olmecs with the [[Mand\u00e9]] people of West Africa.<ref name=\"Ortizde\" />\n\n===Claims of epigraphic evidence===\nSome researchers claim that the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] are related to African scripts.

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

Originally known as the \"WWF Hall of Fame\", it was created in 1993, when [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] was posthumously inducted with a video package. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.

Originally known as the \"WWF Hall of Fame\", it was created in 1993, when [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] was posthumously inducted with a video package. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held in conjunction with the annual [[King of the Ring]] pay-per-view events and the 1996 ceremony was held with the [[Survivor Series]] event. After an eight year hiatus, WWE relaunched the Hall of Fame in 2004 and has held the ceremonies in conjunction with [[WrestleMania]] ever since. Since 2005, portions of the induction ceremonies have aired on television and since 2014 the entire ceremonies have aired on the [[WWE Network]].\n\nAs of 2019, there have been 204 inductees, with 113 wrestlers inducted individually,  37 Legacy Inductees, 15 group inductions (consisting of 43 wrestlers within those groups), 10 celebrities and five Warrior Award recipients, whilst 57 members have been inducted posthumously. Four wrestlers have been inducted twice (individually and as part of a tag team/group): [[Ric Flair]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Bret Hart]], with four more ([[Hulk Hogan]], [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], and [[Sean Waltman]]) to receive a second induction in 2020.<ref name=\"HoF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/|title=WWE Hall of Fame|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=April 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe WWF Hall of Fame was created in 1993.

''Hoshin Engi'' is inspired by the [[Chinese literature|Chinese literary]] classic ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'', a ''[[shenmo]]'' [[novel]]. The story involves the [[Chinese mythology]] and [[history of China]], in particular the last members of the In (Yin Dynasty aka [[Shang Dynasty]]) and the plot to overthrow them.\n\nThe manga series was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine from 1996\u20132000 and compiled in 23 [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes by [[Shueisha]]. [[Viz Media]] acquired the rights to the manga, with bimonthly releases starting June 5, 2007. The manga has been re-released and re-compiled into fewer larger volumes with new cover art, illustrations and afterwords. The 18 ''[[kanzenban]]'' volumes were released periodically between July 2005 and April 2006 in Japan only.\n\nThe story has been adapted into a 26-episodes [[anime]] series titled ''Senkaiden H\u014dshin Engi'', broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] in 1999 and released in North America on DVD as ''Soul Hunter'' in 2001. In January 2009, Shomei TV announced their intentions to remake the anime series if they received 10,000 signatures.\n\nA new 23-episode anime television series adaptation titled ''Haky\u016b H\u014dshin Engi'' and featuring a new cast aired from January to June, 2018. Fujisaki also wrote a short manga series that was serialized in ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' from April to June, 2018.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n\nThe fantastic world of ''Hoshin Engi'' encompass both the pre-historical world\u2014in which primitive human society coexist with the revered divine gods and goddesses\u2014and the futuristic world\u2014in which highly technological weaponry, combat strategy, as well as futuristic visions, are employed. Paopei, the sacred weapons used by Doshi and Sennin alike, are versatile instruments created Sennin.\n\nThe Seven Super Paopei were the ones left from the Original People, and all the rest are copies made from those. Paopei can only be used by Sendou, those born with Sennin bones which are trained to be used to power paopei. If someone born with these bones is not trained, then they become a Tennen Doushi, and the potential of their skeleton creates almost super natural strength or speed; however, they would never be able to use a Paopei. It is possible to transplant Sennin bones into a normal human, as in the case with Younin, but it does not appear to be a common practice. There are such beings as \"human Paopei,\" that is, a living being created from a paopei. They all have a core they are built around, and can take extensive damage and be rebuilt so long as the core remains intact.\n\nBesides paopei, there are spells, an ancient form a magic rarely used by the time series takes place. The only ones seen in the series are the peaches that can turn water into sake, Youzen's transformation technique, and Nentou's various fighting and healing abilities.\n\n===Plot===\n{{main article|List of Hoshin Engi characters}}\n\nThe story is set in legendary China. A beautiful female [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] named {{nihongo|[[Daji|Dakki]]|\u59b2\u5df1}} is controlling the emperor {{nihongo|[[King Zhou of Shang|Ch\u016b-\u014d]]|\u7d02\u738b|Ch\u016b-\u014d}} and the ruling {{Nihongo|[[Shang Dynasty|In]]|\u6bb7}} dynasty, and is using her power over him to do evil in the nation.

In the course of his adventures, Taik\u014db\u014d gathers other powerful companions and sets out to seal away the demons and eventually destroy the fox spirit Dakki.\n\nThere are significant plot differences between the novel, the manga series and the animated adaptations.\n\n====Manga plot====\nThe 23-volume-long series follows the adventures of Taikobo and his trusty {{nihongo|\"Rei-j\u016b\"|\u970a\u7363|Reij\u016b|{{lit}} \"Spirit Beast\" or \"Sacred Beast\"}} {{Nihongo|[[P\u00e8re David's Deer|S\u016b-p\u016b-shan]]|\u56db\u4e0d\u50cf|S\u016bp\u016bshan}}. Taikobo was given a mission by [[Yuanshi Tianzun|Genshi-tenson (\u5143\u59cb\u5929\u5c0a)]] (Taikobou's mentor and the leader of the [[Xian (Taoism)|Sennin (\u4ed9\u4eba)]] World\u2014[[Kunlun Mountain|Konron (\u5d11\u5d19)]]) to complete the Houshin Project.\n\nThe goal of the Hoshin Project, as explained by Genshitenson, is to trap Dakki and her minions in a 'middle' world between the Sennin World and the Human world, renamed {{nihongo|'Shin'|\u795e}} (Deity or Gods) World, named 'Shinkai', Realm of the Gods. Taikobo's mission is to hunt down the 365 people whose names were written on the Hoshin Scroll. As Taikobo defeats and seals off each of the 365 people on the scroll, their souls are instantly transported to the Hoshindai (a floating island made to trap souls) and sealed there until all the 365 souls are gathered.\n\nAt first, Taikobo refused to take up such a troublesome mission, but when threatened with expulsion from Konron, he quickly relented. After that, he was given a {{nihongo|Pao-pei|\u5b9d\u8c9d}}, {{nihongo|Whip of the Gods|\u6253\u795e\u97ad|Dashinben}} (in Chinese literally \"Gods-Hitting Whip\"), as his weapon along with Supushan.\n\nUpon leaving Konron, Taikobou and Supushan immediately met up with the first person listed on the Houshin Scroll, the all-powerful [[Shen Gongbao|Shinkouhyou (\u7533\u516c\u8c79)]] and his Riding Beast\u2014Kokutenko (\u9ed2\u70b9\u864e). After a short battle between the two {{nihongo|Doushi|\u9053\u5e2b}}, in which Taikoubou was easily defeated, Taikoubou suspected that the order of the Houshin Scroll is sorted according to strength (Shinkouhyou being the first on the list) and decides to avoid fighting him. Aiming for the core of the whole problem, he enters the capital, Chouka and defeating one of Dakki's sisters, Ou Kijin (who reverted to her original form, a stone lute), he used her to enter the service of the emperor in order to spot Dakki's weakness. Furious with her sister's plight, Dakki contrives a plan to reclaim her sister. Taikoubou, overwhelmed by her guile, was defeated and was about to be thrown into the taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes) along with some of the Kyou clan, when during a commotion caused by them, Buuseiou Ko Hiko saved him. It was then that he came to a realization that there was no way he could take on Dakki and her followers, on his own. That's why he set off searching for strong fighters to join him on his quest to rid the world of Dakki. Taikoubou soon met up and joined forces with [[Nezha|Nataku (\u54ea\u5412)]], [[:ja:\u96f7\u9707\u5b50|Raishinshi (\u96f7\u9707\u5b50)]], Kou-Tenka (\u9ec4\u5929\u5316) and [[Erlang Shen|Youzen (\u694a\u6229)]].\n\nAs the series progresses, Taikobo slowly realises that there is no hope in disrupting Dakki's strangle hold on the Yin Dynasty or her influence over Chuuou. As such, he abandoned the kingdom and requested that [[King Wen of Zhou|Ki Sh\u014d (\u59eb\u660c)]] form a new Monarchy to rival the Yin, renamed the [[Zhou Dynasty|Sh\u016b Dynasty (\u5468)]] with their new emperor\u2014[[King Wu of Zhou|Bu-ou (\u6b66\u738b)]], who is the second son of Ki Hatsu who had died due to self-starvation caused by Dakki serving him his son as a hamburger during his capture. Taikoubou then became the military advisor to Zhou, helping the Western Army conquer the lands once owned by Yin.\n\nBunch\u016b (\u805e\u4ef2), the senior advisor to the emperor Ch\u016b-ou in the country of Yin and also a pao-pei user, sees Taikoubou as an obstacle and sends out some of his best Doushi companions to attack Taikoubou and company. The ensuing fights between the two groups eventually lead to the involvement of almost all members of the 2 Sennin Worlds\u2014Konron (where Taikoubou originates) and {{nihongo|Kingou-tou|\u91d1\u9c32\u5cf6}} (where Bunchuu learnt his arts). At the climax of the Sennin war, both worlds were completely destroyed with hundreds of souls sealed into the Houshin Dai. And though Bunchuu was eventually defeated, Taikoubou lost many friends and his home in the process.\n\nEventually, after Taikoubou and the Zhou army successfully defeated Chuuou and officially declared the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Taikoubou and company decided to leave the Human world and return to what's left of the Sennin world. It is then revealed to him that there is possibly a third Sennin World, one that belongs to Dakki, and is probably where she and the last of her minions fled to when the Yin country was finally conquered.\n\nGenshitenson also reveals to Taikoubou that the real goal of Houshin Project isn't just about defeating Dakki, it is about defeating the eternal being supporting Dakki throughout all her chaos years\u2014[[N\u00fcwa|Jyoka (\u5973\u5aa7)]], one of the ancients.\n\nThe ultimate enemy of Houshin Engi, Jyoka, is a \"Jui Que\", one of five 'aliens' which landed on the Earth, millions of years ago. Jyoka had a dream to recreate her home world on Earth (which had self-destructed some time ago), but the other aliens disagreed and enclosed her in a glass cage. Later, she was able to move about in her \"soul\" form and direct the trend of history to her liking. This is when she met up with Dakki, and the two started working together to make Jyoka's dream come true. Each time history diverted from what Jyoka wants it to become, she completely destroyed the civilization that existed and started all over again, like a child moulding a perfect sand castle. No one really knows how many civilisations Jyoka had destroyed throughout time in her pursuit to perfectly replicate her old home, but when asked why she's trying to do this, Jyoka simply states that she would like to know what would have happened if her home planet had not made those simple mistakes that led to its own destruction.\n\nAfter hearing the ultimate truth, the Sennins retaliated against Jyoka. Soon, she finally decided to destroy Earth once and for all, and find another world in order to replicate her old home. The battles raged for a while before the deceased Taikoubou (who had 'died' recently) reappeared in front of his comrades again. This time, it is revealed that he was once one of the \"Jui Que\" as well, the last of the 5 aliens and was left on this earth for the sole purpose of killing Jyoka once and for all. Using the energy of his friends as well as those souls trapped in the Houshin Dai, Taikoubou (now renamed 'Fukki') was finally able to defeat Jyoka and release the world from her influences.\n\nJust prior to this happening, Dakki somehow managed to take over Jyoka's body for a time and merged with the life energies of the Earth, becoming the mother of all life. After the fight with Jyoka ended, Jyoka selfishly asked Taikoubou to disappear together with her, afraid of being left alone again and since Taikoubou felt that he had done what he had set out to do, complies (also due to severe injuries in the last fight). When he was about to fade away, Dakki came and saved his life, thus reviving him.\n\nIn the epilogue, Youzen was made the Headmaster of the new Sennin World, with Choukei (Bunchuu's only disciple) representing the Youkai (demons) and Nentou-doujin (ex-Juunisen, who helped defeat Jyoka) representing the Humans, supporting him. Genshi-tenson manages the ex-Houshindai, which houses all the souls which had been houshined, and dispatches them to the Human World if their help is needed. Since these souls are invisible to the Human eye, they are able to solve matters without being seen. When Supushan and Bukichi went to the Human World to update Buou on the happenings of the Sennin World, they found out that Taikoubou is still alive (he visited Buou before they arrived) and went in search for him but to no avail as Taikoubou seemed keen on avoiding them to the extent of following them behind their backs without them knowing, and somehow prevents the people they meet from revealing his whereabouts.\n\nIn the end, Supushan and Bukichi returned to the Sennin World to request Youzen's help. While Taikoubou was lazing around, Shinkouhyou approached him and wanted a duel, but he left saying that it would be boring if his only rival were to perish so quickly by his hand. Taikoubou then disappeared to places unknown.\n\n====Anime plot====\n\nThe 26-episode anime storyline somewhat follows the main plot of the manga, with the young (72-year-old) \"doushi\" (Apprentice to a Sennin) Taikoubou told to go from the Sennin (Immortal) world to Earth (and specifically Yin China) to hunt down 365 renegade evil spirits in order to bring down the fall of Queen Dakki, a Fox spirit who has enslaved the Emperor.\n\nTaikoubou recruits Nataku, a human/weapon hybrid, and Raishinshi, a would-be vigilante, in his quest to hunt down Dakki. He is later joined by Youzen, the Tensai (Genius) Doushi of Kunlun and Kou Tenka, the son of the duke Kou Hiko. He also rides a talking 'hippopotamus' (actually a Reijuu) named Suppushan, who remains the most popular character of the series.\n\nKi Shou, the Lord of the West, is a man who is unwittingly destined to found the Zhou dynasty.  Imprisoned for trying to stop Dakki's evil, he suffers a grievous guilt when his son is murdered and served to him as a meal, causing him to refrain from eating.  Escaping from his captors, he returns with an army to overthrow the Yin with the help of Taikoubou.\n\nIn the midst of this historical drama, the Immortal High Council (a group of three Immortals seemingly of a higher position than Genshi-tenson) is plotting some form of magical spell that requires the capturing of many souls, which made them deliberately lie about the purpose of the Houshin Project to Taikoubou.\n\nThe anime ends with Dakki's death due to the combined efforts of Taikoubou's group and Shinkouhyou, with the Juunisen making a short appearance near the end and no mention of Jyoka.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n''Hoshin Engi'' is written and illustrated by [[Ryu Fujisaki]].

''Hoshin Engi'' is inspired by the [[Chinese literature|Chinese literary]] classic ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'', a ''[[shenmo]]'' [[novel]]. The story involves the [[Chinese mythology]] and [[history of China]], in particular the last members of the In (Yin Dynasty aka [[Shang Dynasty]]) and the plot to overthrow them.\n\nThe manga series was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine from 1996\u20132000 and compiled in 23 [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes by [[Shueisha]]. [[Viz Media]] acquired the rights to the manga, with bimonthly releases starting June 5, 2007. The manga has been re-released and re-compiled into fewer larger volumes with new cover art, illustrations and afterwords. The 18 ''[[kanzenban]]'' volumes were released periodically between July 2005 and April 2006 in Japan only.\n\nThe story has been adapted into a 26-episodes [[anime]] series titled ''Senkaiden H\u014dshin Engi'', broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] in 1999 and released in North America on DVD as ''Soul Hunter'' in 2001. In January 2009, Shomei TV announced their intentions to remake the anime series if they received 10,000 signatures.\n\nA new 23-episode anime television series adaptation titled ''Haky\u016b H\u014dshin Engi'' and featuring a new cast aired from January to June, 2018. Fujisaki also wrote a short manga series that was serialized in ''[[Weekly Young Jump]]'' from April to June, 2018.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting===\n\nThe fantastic world of ''Hoshin Engi'' encompass both the pre-historical world \u2013 in which primitive human society coexist with the revered divine gods and goddesses \u2013  and the futuristic world \u2013 in which highly technological weaponry, combat strategy, as well as futuristic visions, are employed. Paopei, the sacred weapons used by Doshi and Sennin alike, are versatile instruments created Sennin.\n\nThe Seven Super Paopei were the ones left from the Original People, and all the rest are copies made from those. Paopei can only be used by Sendou, those born with Sennin bones which are trained to be used to power paopei. If someone born with these bones is not trained, then they become a Tennen Doushi, and the potential of their skeleton creates almost super natural strength or speed; however, they would never be able to use a Paopei. It is possible to transplant Sennin bones into a normal human, as in the case with Younin, but it does not appear to be a common practice. There are such beings as \"human Paopei,\" that is, a living being created from a paopei. They all have a core they are built around, and can take extensive damage and be rebuilt so long as the core remains intact.\n\nBesides paopei, there are spells, an ancient form a magic rarely used by the time series takes place. The only ones seen in the series are the peaches that can turn water into sake, Youzen's transformation technique, and Nentou's various fighting and healing abilities.\n\n===Plot===\n\n{{main article|List of Hoshin Engi characters}}\n\nThe story is set in legendary China. A beautiful female [[Huli jing|fox spirit]] named {{nihongo|[[Daji|Dakki]]|\u59b2\u5df1}} is controlling the emperor {{nihongo|[[King Zhou of Shang|Ch\u016b-\u014d]]|\u7d02\u738b|Ch\u016b-\u014d}} and the ruling {{Nihongo|[[Shang Dynasty|In]]|\u6bb7}} dynasty, and is using her power over him to do evil in the nation. An immortal-in-training named {{nihongo|[[Jiang Ziya|Taik\u014db\u014d]]|\u592a\u516c\u671b}} is chosen by the great immortal sages for the {{Nihongo|H\u014dshin Project|\u5c01\u795e\u8a08\u753b}} &mdash; to seal away or destroy the evil demons that infest the world. In the course of his adventures, Taik\u014db\u014d gathers other powerful companions and sets out to seal away the demons and eventually destroy the fox spirit Dakki.\n\nThere are significant plot differences between the novel, the manga series and the animated adaptations.\n\n====Manga plot====\n\nThe 23-volume-long series follows the adventures of Taikobo and his trusty {{nihongo|\"Rei-j\u016b\"|\u970a\u7363|Reij\u016b|{{lit}} \"Spirit Beast\" or \"Sacred Beast\"}} {{Nihongo|[[P\u00e8re David's Deer|S\u016b-p\u016b-shan]]|\u56db\u4e0d\u50cf|S\u016bp\u016bshan}}. Taikobo was given a mission by [[Yuanshi Tianzun|Genshi-tenson (\u5143\u59cb\u5929\u5c0a)]] (Taikobou's mentor and the leader of the [[Xian (Taoism)|Sennin (\u4ed9\u4eba)]] World - [[Kunlun Mountain|Konron (\u5d11\u5d19)]]) to complete the Houshin Project.\n\nThe goal of the Hoshin Project, as explained by Genshitenson, is to trap Dakki and her minions in a 'middle' world between the Sennin World and the Human world, renamed {{nihongo|'Shin'|\u795e}} (Deity or Gods) World, named 'Shinkai', Realm of the Gods. Taikobo's mission is to hunt down the 365 people whose names were written on the Hoshin Scroll. As Taikobo defeats and seals off each of the 365 people on the scroll, their souls are instantly transported to the Hoshindai (a floating island made to trap souls) and sealed there until all the 365 souls are gathered.\n\nAt first, Taikobo refused to take up such a troublesome mission, but when threatened with expulsion from Konron, he quickly relented. After that, he was given a {{nihongo|Pao-pei|\u5b9d\u8c9d}}, {{nihongo|Whip of the Gods|\u6253\u795e\u97ad|Dashinben}} (in Chinese literally \"Gods-Hitting Whip\"), as his weapon along with Supushan.\n\nUpon leaving Konron, Taikobou and Supushan immediately met up with the first person listed on the Houshin Scroll, the all-powerful [[Shen Gongbao|Shinkouhyou (\u7533\u516c\u8c79)]] and his Riding Beast - Kokutenko (\u9ed2\u70b9\u864e). After a short battle between the two {{nihongo|Doushi|\u9053\u5e2b}}, in which Taikoubou was easily defeated, Taikoubou suspected that the order of the Houshin Scroll is sorted according to strength (Shinkouhyou being the first on the list) and decides to avoid fighting him. Aiming for the core of the whole problem, he enters the capital, Chouka and defeating one of Dakki's sisters, Ou Kijin (who reverted to her original form, a stone lute), he used her to enter the service of the emperor in order to spot Dakki's weakness. Furious with her sister's plight, Dakki contrives a plan to reclaim her sister. Taikoubou, overwhelmed by her guile, was defeated and was about to be thrown into the taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes) along with some of the Kyou clan, when during a commotion caused by them, Buuseiou Ko Hiko saved him. It was then that he came to a realization that there was no way he could take on Dakki and her followers, on his own. That's why he set off searching for strong fighters to join him on his quest to rid the world of Dakki. Taikoubou soon met up and joined forces with [[Nezha|Nataku (\u54ea\u5412)]], [[:ja:\u96f7\u9707\u5b50|Raishinshi (\u96f7\u9707\u5b50)]], Kou-Tenka (\u9ec4\u5929\u5316) and [[Erlang Shen|Youzen (\u694a\u6229)]].\n\nAs the series progresses, Taikobo slowly realises that there is no hope in disrupting Dakki's strangle hold on the Yin Dynasty or her influence over Chuuou. As such, he abandoned the kingdom and requested that [[King Wen of Zhou|Ki Sh\u014d (\u59eb\u660c)]] form a new Monarchy to rival the Yin, renamed the [[Zhou Dynasty|Sh\u016b Dynasty (\u5468)]] with their new emperor - [[King Wu of Zhou|Bu-ou (\u6b66\u738b)]], who is the second son of Ki Hatsu who had died due to self-starvation caused by Dakki serving him his son as a hamburger during his capture. Taikoubou then became the military advisor to Zhou, helping the Western Army conquer the lands once owned by Yin.\n\nBunch\u016b (\u805e\u4ef2), the senior advisor to the emperor Ch\u016b-ou in the country of Yin and also a pao-pei user, sees Taikoubou as an obstacle and sends out some of his best Doushi companions to attack Taikoubou and company. The ensuing fights between the two groups eventually lead to the involvement of almost all members of the 2 Sennin Worlds - Konron (where Taikoubou originates) and {{nihongo|Kingou-tou|\u91d1\u9c32\u5cf6}} (where Bunchuu learnt his arts). At the climax of the Sennin war, both worlds were completely destroyed with hundreds of souls sealed into the Houshin Dai. And though Bunchuu was eventually defeated, Taikoubou lost many friends and his home in the process.\n\nEventually, after Taikoubou and the Zhou army successfully defeated Chuuou and officially declared the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Taikoubou and company decided to leave the Human world and return to what's left of the Sennin world. It is then revealed to him that there is possibly a third Sennin World, one that belongs to Dakki, and is probably where she and the last of her minions fled to when the Yin country was finally conquered.\n\nGenshitenson also reveals to Taikoubou that the real goal of Houshin Project isn't just about defeating Dakki, it is about defeating the eternal being supporting Dakki throughout all her chaos years - [[N\u00fcwa|Jyoka (\u5973\u5aa7)]], one of the ancients.\n\nThe ultimate enemy of Houshin Engi - Jyoka is a \"Jui Que\", one of 5 'aliens' which landed on the Earth, millions of years ago. Jyoka had a dream to recreate her home world on Earth (which had self-destructed some time ago), but the other aliens disagreed and enclosed her in a glass cage. Later, she was able to move about in her \"soul\" form and direct the trend of history to her liking. This is when she met up with Dakki, and the two started working together to make Jyoka's dream come true. Each time history diverted from what Jyoka wants it to become, she completely destroyed the civilization that existed and started all over again, like a child moulding a perfect sand castle. No one really knows how many civilisations Jyoka had destroyed throughout time in her pursuit to perfectly replicate her old home, but when asked why she's trying to do this, Jyoka simply states that she would like to know what would have happened if her home planet had not made those simple mistakes that led to its own destruction.\n\nAfter hearing the ultimate truth, the Sennins retaliated against Jyoka. Soon, she finally decided to destroy Earth once and for all, and find another world in order to replicate her old home. The battles raged for a while before the deceased Taikoubou (who had 'died' recently) reappeared in front of his comrades again. This time, it is revealed that he was once one of the \"Jui Que\" as well, the last of the 5 aliens and was left on this earth for the sole purpose of killing Jyoka once and for all. Using the energy of his friends as well as those souls trapped in the Houshin Dai, Taikoubou (now renamed 'Fukki') was finally able to defeat Jyoka and release the world from her influences.\n\nJust prior to this happening, Dakki somehow managed to take over Jyoka's body for a time and merged with the life energies of the Earth, becoming the mother of all life. After the fight with Jyoka ended, Jyoka selfishly asked Taikoubou to disappear together with her, afraid of being left alone again and since Taikoubou felt that he had done what he had set out to do, complies (also due to severe injuries in the last fight). When he was about to fade away, Dakki came and saved his life, thus reviving him.\n\nIn the epilogue, Youzen was made the Headmaster of the new Sennin World, with Choukei (Bunchuu's only disciple) representing the Youkai (demons) and Nentou-doujin (ex-Juunisen, who helped defeat Jyoka) representing the Humans, supporting him. Genshi-tenson manages the ex-Houshindai, which houses all the souls which had been houshined, and dispatches them to the Human World if their help is needed. Since these souls are invisible to the Human eye, they are able to solve matters without being seen. When Supushan and Bukichi went to the Human World to update Buou on the happenings of the Sennin World, they found out that Taikoubou is still alive (he visited Buou before they arrived) and went in search for him but to no avail as Taikoubou seemed keen on avoiding them to the extent of following them behind their backs without them knowing, and somehow prevents the people they meet from revealing his whereabouts.\n\nIn the end, Supushan and Bukichi returned to the Sennin World to request Youzen's help. While Taikoubou was lazing around, Shinkouhyou approached him and wanted a duel, but he left saying that it would be boring if his only rival were to perish so quickly by his hand. Taikoubou then disappeared to places unknown.\n\n====Anime plot====\n\nThe 26-episode anime storyline somewhat follows the main plot of the manga, with the young (72-year-old) \"doushi\" (Apprentice to a Sennin) Taikoubou told to go from the Sennin (Immortal) world to Earth (and specifically Yin China) to hunt down 365 renegade evil spirits in order to bring down the fall of Queen Dakki, a Fox spirit who has enslaved the Emperor.\n\nTaikoubou recruits Nataku, a human/weapon hybrid, and Raishinshi, a would-be vigilante, in his quest to hunt down Dakki. He is later joined by Youzen, the Tensai (Genius) Doushi of Kunlun and Kou Tenka, the son of the duke Kou Hiko. He also rides a talking 'hippopotamus' (actually a Reijuu) named Suppushan, who remains the most popular character of the series.\n\nKi Shou, the Lord of the West, is a man who is unwittingly destined to found the Zhou dynasty.  Imprisoned for trying to stop Dakki's evil, he suffers a grievous guilt when his son is murdered and served to him as a meal, causing him to refrain from eating.  Escaping from his captors, he returns with an army to overthrow the Yin with the help of Taikoubou.\n\nIn the midst of this historical drama, the Immortal High Council (a group of three Immortals seemingly of a higher position than Genshi-tenson) is plotting some form of magical spell that requires the capturing of many souls, which made them deliberately lie about the purpose of the Houshin Project to Taikoubou.\n\nThe anime ends with Dakki's death due to the combined efforts of Taikoubou's group and Shinkouhyou, with the Juunisen making a short appearance near the end and no mention of Jyoka.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n''Hoshin Engi'' is written and illustrated by [[Ryu Fujisaki]].
