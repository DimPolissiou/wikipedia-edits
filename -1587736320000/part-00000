Sims]]'' established that states must draw districts that are \"substantially equal\" in population to one another. Federal court cases have established that deviation between the largest and smallest districts generally cannot be greater than ten percent. Some states have laws requiring less deviation. Court cases have also required states to redistrict every ten years, although states can redistrict more often than that depending on their own statutes and constitutional provisions.<ref name=\"levittmcdonald\"/> States are free to employ multi-member districts, and different districts can elect different numbers of legislators.<ref name=\"governing1\">{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Josh|title=The Disappearance of Multi-Member Constituencies|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/The-Disappearance-of-Multi-Member-Constituencies.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|publisher=Governing|date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108202750/http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/The-Disappearance-of-Multi-Member-Constituencies.html|archive-date=8 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Voting Rights Act of 1965 establishes protections against racial redistricting plans that would deny minority voters an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. The Supreme Court case of ''Thornburg v.

In the other states, the legislature is ultimately charged with drawing new lines, although some states have advisory or back-up commissions. Connecticut, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas have backup commissions that draw district lines if the legislature is unable to agree on new districts.  Iowa, Maine, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont employ advisory commissions. In Oregon, the Secretary of State will draw the legislative districts if legislature fails to do so. In Connecticut and Maine, a 2/3 super-majority vote in each house is required to create new districts, while in Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi, and North Carolina, the governor cannot veto redistricting plans.<ref name=\"jlevitt2\">{{cite web|last1=Levitt|first1=Justin|title=Who draws the lines?|url=http://redistricting.lls.edu/who-state.php|accessdate=28 October 2016|publisher=Loyola Law School}}</ref> The legislatures of Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia can override gubernatorial vetoes with a simple majority vote,<ref name=\"jhaughey1\"/> giving governors in those states little leverage in the drawing of new district maps.\n\nMost states must pass redistricting plans by the time of the filing deadlines for the 2022 election.

Federal court cases have established that deviation between the largest and smallest districts generally cannot be greater than ten percent. Some states have laws requiring less deviation. Court cases have also required states to redistrict every ten years, although states can redistrict more often than that depending on their own statutes and constitutional provisions.<ref name=\"levittmcdonald\"/> States are free to employ multi-member districts, and different districts can elect different numbers of legislators.<ref name=\"governing1\">{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Josh|title=The Disappearance of Multi-Member Constituencies|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/The-Disappearance-of-Multi-Member-Constituencies.html|accessdate=31 October 2016|publisher=Governing|date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108202750/http://www.governing.com/blogs/politics/The-Disappearance-of-Multi-Member-Constituencies.html|archive-date=8 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Voting Rights Act of 1965 establishes protections against racial redistricting plans that would deny minority voters an equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice.

In the other states, the legislature is ultimately charged with drawing new lines, although some states have advisory or back-up commissions.

Iowa, Maine, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont employ advisory commissions. In Oregon, the Secretary of State will draw the legislative districts if legislature fails to do so.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson has been a controversial figure in British journalism and politics. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson has been a controversial figure in British journalism and politics. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

Unlike the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which was initially only available through [[shareware]] and mail order, ''Doom II'' was sold in stores. ''Master Levels for Doom II'', an [[expansion pack]] with 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995.<ref name=\"ml-faq\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was [[Porting#Porting_in_gaming|ported]] to the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002, on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in 2010,<ref name=\"Shacknews-DM2\"/><ref name=\"XboxLive-DM2\"/> and on [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in 2019.<ref name=\"OriginalDoom\"/> The release of the ''Doom'' [[Open source|source code]] has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including the Apple [[iPhone]] and several other types of cell phones.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:DOOM2 ingame 1.png|thumb|left|The [[double-barreled shotgun]] in use]]\n\n''Doom II'' was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, ''Doom II's'' levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.\n\nRather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first ''Doom'', gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of ''Doom''), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of ''Doom'' available in ''[[The Ultimate Doom]]'', the [[retail]] re-release of the original ''Doom''). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.\n\n''Doom II'' doubled the number of non-[[Boss (video games)|boss]] monster types and started using bosses from the original ''Doom'' as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the double-barreled shotgun (called the Super Shotgun in the game), and a new power-up, the Megasphere.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Doom''{{'}}s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in ''Doom II'', including \"out of the box\" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in [[deathmatch]]-style combat. There was also [[LAN|Local area network]] (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original ''Doom''. As with the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service [[DWANGO]] or with once-popular programs like [[Kali (software)|Kali]] and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, ''Doom II'' can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party [[Source port|source ports]] such as ''[[Odamex]]'',<ref name=\"OnlineDoom2\"/> ''[[Zandronum]]'',<ref name=\"Zandronum\"/>\n''[[ZDaemon]]'',<ref name=\"ZDaemon\"/> and are still popular today.<ref name=\"WyeSoft\"/> The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] port of ''Doom II'' supports online multiplayer via [[Xbox Live]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and [[Hell]].\n \nImmediately following the events in ''Doom'', the player once again assumes the role of [[Doomguy|an unnamed space marine]]. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, The demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/><ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/>\n\nThe humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/> The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.<ref name=\"timbrastowguide\"/>\n\nJust as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in [[space orbit|orbit]], who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.\n\nAfter fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest [[demon]] he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin ([[Baphomet]]). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed.\n\n==Development==\nMost of the levels were designed by [[Sandy Petersen]],<ref name=\"JRShoot\"/> with [[American McGee]] playing a significant role as well. The final level, ''Icon of Sin'', contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] where two of the artists put the disembodied head of [[John Romero]] as the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be hit by rockets three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying \"To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero\", putting it through various [[Audio filter|filters]] to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the \"demonic chant\" spoken by the head upon spotting the player.<ref name=\"JRInterview\"/><ref name=\"IconSin\"/> The photo that was scanned for the \"John Romero's head\"-sprite was from a [[Businessweek]] photo shot in 1994.<ref name=\"JRBusWeek\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized.<ref name=\"3DO-Doom2\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2Preview\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2PreviewII\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was first released on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the [[Doomsday rule]] and exactly ten months after the original), in both North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DoomsdayRule\"/><ref name=\"DoomII-20Years\"/><ref name=\"DoomBlue\"/>\n\n==Expansions==\n===''Master Levels for Doom II''===\n''Master Levels for Doom II'' is an official [[expansion pack]] for ''Doom II'' which was released on December 26, 1995 by [[id Software]]. The CD contains 20 [[Doom modding|WAD]] files created by various authors under contract. There was also an additional bonus called ''Maximum Doom'' consisting of 3,000 [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] levels.<ref name=\"MaxDoom\"/>\n\n===''No Rest for the Living''===\n''No Rest for the Living'' is the title of an expansion pack developed by [[Nerve Software]] for the release of ''Doom II'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the Xbox 360. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 ''Doom II'' release from ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'', as part of ''Doom Classic Complete'' for the [[PlayStation Network]], and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 [[Unity engine]] port of ''Doom II''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Sales===\nAccording to [[David Kushner]] in ''[[Masters of Doom]]'', id Software shipped 600,000 units of ''Doom II'' to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months.<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/> Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves.<ref name=\"Pioneer-GTInteractive\"/> The game was the United States' highest-selling computer title of 1994.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone.<ref name=\"slow\"/>\n\nIn the United States, ''Doom II'' was the third-best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, with 1.55 million units sold during that period.<ref name=\"alltimesales\"/> Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million. Of the latter figure, Kushner wrote that \"30 percent [...] came from Germany\u2014a country that had banned the game from its shelves.\"<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/>\n\n===Critical reviews===\n{{Video game reviews\n | MC = PC: 83/100<ref name=\"MC\"/><br />GBA: 77/100<ref name=\"MC-GBA\"/><br />X360: 77/100<ref name=\"MC-X360\"/>\n | Allgame = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Allgame-DM2\"/>\n | NGen = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NG\"/>\n | PCPP = 3/10 <small>(Master Levels)</small><ref name=\"MasterLevels\"/>\n | GSpot = 8.5 /10 <small>(PC)</small><ref name=Spot>{{cite web |last=Gamespot Staff |date=May 1, 1996 |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-ii-review/1900-2539987/ |title=Doom II Review (GameSpot)|publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n | GSpy = {{rating|4.5|5}} <small>(GBA)</small><ref name=Spy>{{cite web |last=Fryman|first=Avi |date=October 26, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030134428/http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/doom-ii/547320p1.html |archive-date=October 3, 2004|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/doom-ii/547320p1.html|title=GameSpy: Doom II|publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n | rev1 = ''[[MacUser]]''\n | rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"macuser\"/>\n| rev2 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev2Score = A<ref name=ET>{{cite web |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris|date=October 28, 1994 |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/28/pc-game-review-doom-ii-hell-earth/ |title=PC Game Review: 'Doom II: Hell on Earth'|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe reception of ''Doom II'' was positive, with reviewers saying it refined everything that made the original ''Doom'' good.<ref name=\"GR-DM2\"/> According to ''Dragon'', \"if mindless but intense carnage is what you want, you'll get your money's worth.

Unlike the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which was initially only available through [[shareware]] and mail order, ''Doom II'' was sold in stores. ''Master Levels for Doom II'', an [[expansion pack]] with 21 new levels, was released on December 26, 1995.<ref name=\"ml-faq\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was [[Video game port|ported]] to the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2002, on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] in 2010,<ref name=\"Shacknews-DM2\"/><ref name=\"XboxLive-DM2\"/> and on [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] in 2019.<ref name=\"OriginalDoom\"/> The release of the ''Doom'' [[Open source|source code]] has facilitated ports to many other platforms, including the Apple [[iPhone]] and several other types of cell phones.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:DOOM2 ingame 1.png|thumb|left|The [[double-barreled shotgun]] in use]]\n\n''Doom II'' was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game still consists of the player navigating large nonlinear levels. Each level is infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether it be a switch or a teleporter; the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As with its predecessor, ''Doom II's'' levels can be completed in a straightforward fashion. However, because the levels are [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] players can wander off the beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements than the original.\n\nRather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first ''Doom'', gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as in the original episodes of ''Doom''), the screens between each level simply show a background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of ''Doom'' available in ''[[The Ultimate Doom]]'', the [[retail]] re-release of the original ''Doom''). This also means the player is never forced to lose all of their inventory after completing an episode.\n\n''Doom II'' doubled the number of non-[[Boss (video games)|boss]] monster types and started using bosses from the original ''Doom'' as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new weapon, the double-barreled shotgun (called the Super Shotgun in the game), and a new power-up, the Megasphere.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Doom''{{'}}s multiplayer functionality was greatly improved in ''Doom II'', including \"out of the box\" support for a vastly increased number of dial-up modems. The two-player dial-up connection allowed one player to dial into the other player's computer in order to play either cooperatively or in [[deathmatch]]-style combat. There was also [[LAN|Local area network]] (LAN) functionality added, which was improved upon as patches and updates were released. This functionality was later incorporated into the original ''Doom''. As with the original ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', multiplayer games used to be played using the dial-up or LAN by the internal setup program (setup.exe), through the online service [[DWANGO]] or with once-popular programs like [[Kali (software)|Kali]] and Kahn (using SPX) in Windows 95. Nowadays, in the modern standards, ''Doom II'' can be played with almost any version of Windows across the internet using third-party [[Source port|source ports]] such as ''[[Odamex]]'',<ref name=\"OnlineDoom2\"/> ''[[Zandronum]]'',<ref name=\"Zandronum\"/>\n''[[ZDaemon]]'',<ref name=\"ZDaemon\"/> and are still popular today.<ref name=\"WyeSoft\"/> The [[Xbox Live Arcade]] port of ''Doom II'' supports online multiplayer via [[Xbox Live]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe continuous 30 levels are divided into four areas; UAC Underground, UAC's Starport (Hellish Outpost), City, and [[Hell]].\n \nImmediately following the events in ''Doom'', the player once again assumes the role of [[Doomguy|an unnamed space marine]]. After defeating the Spider Mastermind, The demons of hell open a portal to Earth for the marine, as he has \"proven too tough for Hell to contain\". After returning to Earth, the marine finds that it has also been invaded by the demons, who have killed billions of people.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/><ref name=\"lombardi199407\"/>\n\nThe humans who survived the attack have developed a plan to build massive [[Spacecraft|spaceships]] which will carry the remaining survivors into space. Unfortunately, Earth's only ground spaceport has been taken over by the demons, who placed a flame barrier over it, preventing any ships from leaving.<ref name=\"classicdoomtext\"/> The marine battles hordes of demons and is able to deactivate the force field, allowing the remaining humans to escape. Once all the survivors have escaped Earth, the marine is the only human left on the planet.<ref name=\"timbrastowguide\"/>\n\nJust as he sits down to await death, knowing that he saved humanity, the marine then receives an off-planet transmission from the survivors in [[space orbit|orbit]], who have managed to find out where the armies of Hell are coming from. The message reveals that the demonic base is in the center of the marine's own hometown. He then fights through the city until he reaches the base, but sees there is no way to stop the invasion on that side. He decides to step into the portal to try deactivating it from the other side, entering Hell.\n\nAfter fighting through the hordes of Hell, the marine reaches the location of the biggest [[demon]] he has ever seen, called the Icon of Sin ([[Baphomet]]). He kills the Icon of Sin by firing rockets into its exposed brain. Its death causes devastation on Hell, and the portal to Earth is sealed.\n\n==Development==\nMost of the levels were designed by [[Sandy Petersen]],<ref name=\"JRShoot\"/> with [[American McGee]] playing a significant role as well. The final level, ''Icon of Sin'', contains an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] where two of the artists put the disembodied head of [[John Romero]] as the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] hidden behind the icon on the wall which must be hit by rockets three times to win the game. Romero, while playing the level to work on its sound effects, accidentally stumbled upon this in-joke of himself. After realising what his co-workers had done, Romero himself answered by recording his voice saying \"To win the game, you must kill me, John Romero\", putting it through various [[Audio filter|filters]] to distort it, then reverse the recording to create the \"demonic chant\" spoken by the head upon spotting the player.<ref name=\"JRInterview\"/><ref name=\"IconSin\"/> The photo that was scanned for the \"John Romero's head\"-sprite was from a [[Businessweek]] photo shot in 1994.<ref name=\"JRBusWeek\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] version was announced to be in development by Art Data Interactive, but it never materialized.<ref name=\"3DO-Doom2\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2Preview\"/><ref name=\"3DO-Doom2PreviewII\"/>\n\n''Doom II'' was first released on October 10, 1994 (one of the days of the [[Doomsday rule]] and exactly ten months after the original), in both North America and Europe.<ref name=\"DoomsdayRule\"/><ref name=\"DoomII-20Years\"/><ref name=\"DoomBlue\"/>\n\n==Expansions==\n===''Master Levels for Doom II''===\n''Master Levels for Doom II'' is an official [[expansion pack]] for ''Doom II'' which was released on December 26, 1995 by [[id Software]]. The CD contains 20 [[Doom modding|WAD]] files created by various authors under contract. There was also an additional bonus called ''Maximum Doom'' consisting of 3,000 [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] levels.<ref name=\"MaxDoom\"/>\n\n===''No Rest for the Living''===\n''No Rest for the Living'' is the title of an expansion pack developed by [[Nerve Software]] for the release of ''Doom II'' on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the Xbox 360. It consists of eight regular levels and one secret level. It is also included in the 2012 ''Doom II'' release from ''[[Doom 3: BFG Edition]]'', as part of ''Doom Classic Complete'' for the [[PlayStation Network]], and has been released as a free add-on for the 2019 [[Unity engine]] port of ''Doom II''.\n\n==Reception==\n===Sales===\nAccording to [[David Kushner]] in ''[[Masters of Doom]]'', id Software shipped 600,000 units of ''Doom II'' to stores in preparation for its launch. This initial shipment sold out within a month on shelves, despite its being expected to last for three months.<ref name=\"mastersdoom\"/> Pre-orders for the game were so massive that it was difficult to buy from a store. The game products were displayed on pallets rather than shelves.<ref name=\"Pioneer-GTInteractive\"/> The game was the United States' highest-selling computer title of 1994.<ref name=\"latimes\"/> It placed 10th for 1996, with 322,671 units sold and $12.6 million earned in the region that year alone.<ref name=\"slow\"/>\n\nIn the United States, ''Doom II'' was the third-best-selling computer game between 1993 and 1999, with 1.55 million units sold during that period.<ref name=\"alltimesales\"/> Its revenues in that country ultimately reached $80 million, while those in Europe reached $20 million.

This block was discovered by locals in the Olmec heartland and was dated by the archaeologists to approximately 900 BCE based on other debris. If the authenticity and date can be verified, this will prove to be the earliest writing yet found in Mesoamerica. The symbols on the Cascajal block are unlike those of any other writing system in Mesoamerica, such as in [[Mayan languages]] or [[Isthmian script|Isthmian]], another extinct Mesoamerican script. The Cascajal block is also unusual because the symbols apparently run in horizontal rows and \"there is no strong evidence of overall organization.
