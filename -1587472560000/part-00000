In 1949, [[Jerry Wexler]], a reporter for ''Billboard'' magazine, reversed the words and coined the name \u201cRhythm and Blues\u201d to replace the term \u201cRace Music\" for the magazine\u2019s black music chart.<ref name=\"Gulla2008\">{{cite book|author=Bob Gulla|title=Icons of R & B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists who Revolutionized Rhythm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=RA1-PR11|date=16 January 2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34044-4|pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref>\n\nOne style of rhythm and blues was mostly vocal, with instrumental backing that ranged from a full orchestra to none. It was most often performed by a group, frequently a quartet, as in the black gospel tradition; utilizing close harmonies, this style was nearly always performed in a slow to medium tempo. The lead voice, usually one in the upper register, often sang over the driving, wordless chords of the other singers or interacted with them in a [[call-and-response]] exchange. Vocal harmony groups such as the Ink Spots embodied this style, the direct antecedent of doo-wop, which rose from inner city street corners in the mid-1950s and ranked high on the popular music charts between 1955 and 1959.<ref name=\"Modleski1986\" />\n\nWhite artists such as [[Elvis Presley]] performed and recorded covers of rhythm and blues songs (created by African American artists) that were marketed to a white audience.<ref name=\"Taruskin2006\">{{cite book|author=Richard Taruskin|title=Music in the Late Twentieth Century: The Oxford History of Western Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWFmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA313|date=14 August 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-979593-2|page=313}}</ref> One consequence of this [[cultural appropriation]] was to bring together audiences and artists who shared an interest in the music.<ref name=\"Bertrand200010\">{{cite book|author=Michael T.

According to Bobby Robinson, a well-known producer of the period: \n<blockquote>Doo-wop originally started out as the black teenage expression of the '50s and rap emerged as the black teenage ghetto expression of the '70s. Same identical thing that started it \u2013 the doowop groups down the street, in hallways, in alleys and on the corner. They'd gather anywhere and, you know, doo-wop doowah da dadada. You'd hear it everywhere. So the same thing started with rap groups around '76 or so. All of a sudden, everywhere you turned you'd hear kids rapping.

By 1948, RCA Victor was marketing black music under the name \"Blues and Rhythm\". In 1949, [[Jerry Wexler]], a reporter for ''Billboard'' magazine, reversed the words and coined the name \u201cRhythm and Blues\u201d to replace the term \u201cRace Music\" for the magazine\u2019s black music chart.<ref name=\"Gulla2008\">{{cite book|author=Bob Gulla|title=Icons of R & B and Soul: An Encyclopedia of the Artists who Revolutionized Rhythm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLgqFaYmgw8C&pg=RA1-PR11|date=16 January 2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34044-4|pages=xi\u2013xii}}</ref>\n\nOne style of rhythm and blues was mostly vocal, with instrumental backing that ranged from a full orchestra to none. It was most often performed by a group, frequently a quartet, as in the black gospel tradition; utilizing close harmonies, this style was nearly always performed in a slow to medium tempo. The lead voice, usually one in the upper register, often sang over the driving, wordless chords of the other singers or interacted with them in a [[call-and-response]] exchange. Vocal harmony groups such as the Ink Spots embodied this style, the direct antecedent of doo-wop, which rose from inner city street corners in the mid-1950s and ranked high on the popular music charts between 1955 and 1959.<ref name=\"Modleski1986\" />\n\nWhite artists such as [[Elvis Presley]] performed and recorded covers of rhythm and blues songs (created by African American artists) that were marketed to a white audience.<ref name=\"Taruskin2006\">{{cite book|author=Richard Taruskin|title=Music in the Late Twentieth Century: The Oxford History of Western Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWFmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA313|date=14 August 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-979593-2|page=313}}</ref> One consequence of this [[cultural appropriation]] was to bring together audiences and artists who shared an interest in the music.<ref name=\"Bertrand200010\">{{cite book|author=Michael T.

According to Bobby Robinson, a well-known producer of the period: \n<blockquote>Doo-wop originally started out as the black teenage expression of the '50s and rap emerged as the black teenage ghetto expression of the '70s. Same identical thing that started it \u2013 the doowop groups down the street, in hallways, in alleys and on the corner. They'd gather anywhere and, you know, doo-wop doowah da dadada. You'd hear it everywhere. So the same thing started with rap groups around '76 or so. All of a sudden, everywhere you turned you'd hear kids rapping. In the summertime, they'd have these little parties in the park. They used to go out and play at night and kids would be out there dancing. All of a sudden, all you could hear was, hip hop hit the top don't stop. It's kids - to a great extent mixed-up and confused - reaching out to express themselves.

However, the people had to move to other departments of Colombia like [[Huila Department|Huila]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]].\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Paezan languages}}\n\nP\u00e1ez is generally considered to be a language isolate, or at least the only surviving member of its family (Adelaar & Muysken 2004). Jolkesky (2017) argues for a connection, perhaps genetic, with the Otomanguean languages of the Pacific coast of central Mexico, especially with the Zapotecan branch, and for a possible Otomanguean substratum in a couple of families neighboring Paez. The proposal has not been peer-reviewed.\n\n==Varieties==\nBelow is a full list of Paezan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n*'''Paez''' / '''Paisa''' - language spoken in the villages of the [[Paez River]], department of Huila. Dialects:\n**'''Nasayuw\u00e4''' - spoken in the village of Pitayo.\n**'''Okoshkoky\u00e9wa''' - spoken in the village of La Pe\u00f1a.\n**'''Paniquita''' - spoken in some villages, [[Paniquita]] and others, in the Huila region.\n\n*'''Panzaleo''' / '''Latacunga''' / '''Quito''' - extinct language once spoken in the provinces of [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], [[Cotopaxi]], and [[Tungurahua]], Ecuador.\n*'''Alaus\u00ed''' - once spoken in the village of [[Alaus\u00ed]], Chimborazo province, Ecuador. (Unattested.)\n\n==History==\nAlthough many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], [[Cariban languages|Caribe]], [[Quechuan languages|Quichua]], [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]], [[Guajiboan languages|Guahibo]], [[Macro-Puinavean languages|Mak\u00fa-Puinave]], [[Bora-Witoto languages|Witoto-Bora]], [[Piaroa-Saliban languages|S\u00e1liba]], and [[Choco languages|Choc\u00f3]]. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from [[Santa Marta]]: [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]], [[Kogi language|kogui]], [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]], [[U'wa language|Tunebo]], [[Bar\u00ed language|Motilone]], [[Chimila language|Chimila]] and [[Kuna language|Cuna]], but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.\n\nAgriculture is the basis of the people's economy and so they have been fighting to expand their fields. With territorial expansion, they could spread out their own language. For instance, Nasa Yuwe speakers could recently develop their culture in the east and the west of their own township.\n\nThe language has been endangered for many centuries. The first threat against the language was in the 17th century, with the imposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for education in Colombia.\n\nIn the 20th century, people believed that Nasa Yuwe had roots from Chibcha, but the former language is now considered an isolate. Also, in the P\u00e1ez townships, there are many groups of Guambianos that allow the creation of some linguistic variations and bilingualism.\n\nIn education, the Nasa Yuwe were oppressed by the dominant culture, which wanted them to become Colombian citizens. Schooling was partly to civilize the indigenous; children who spoke in their native language were punished such as by being forced to kneel on grains of corn for hours. Thus, people were forced to avoid their native language.\n\n==Revitalization==\nWith the General Law of Education, ethnoeducation is the opportunity of education for ethnic groups, but education needs to be related to the culture, traditions, language, and native elements of ethnic groups. To achieve the goal to give importance to indigenous languages, it is important to ensure that future indigenous generations preserve and relearn languages that do not have social privilege in Colombian society. Thus, it was necessary to implement booklets and original content material in the different languages.\n\nAlthough the government proposed the introduction of education of native languages in some communities, the preservation of languages and identities has been neglected. It is important to revitalize the language because it is part of the identity of many people who have been not considered part of Colombian society.\n\nThe first step is for the native teachers to know all the academic aspects and the sociocultural aspects of the ethnic group. The next is the creation of a campaign to promote the importance of the language in a minority community to maintain identity. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the use of the language in the education environment and the family environment because they are children's first and most influential contacts. The last step is to promote the project to being used with other endangered languages of our country and revitalize them. Also, it is also necessary to create a conscience in the rest of the society to avoid the marginalization of the people who speak these native languages.\n\n== Phonology ==\nPaez has four vowel sounds: /i, e, a, u/. Each vowel demonstrates nasalization /\u0129 \u1ebd \u00e3 \u0169/, aspiration /i\u02b0 e\u02b0 a\u02b0 u\u02b0/, and vowel length /i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 u\u02d0/, all of which are contrastive. In addition, each vowel sound can be laryngealized /\u1e2d \u1e1b a\u0330 \u1e75/. Laryngealization can occur to nasalized or plain vowels, but not to lengthened vowels, while nasalization can occur to a plain or lengthened vowel. However, vowel length is not contrastive in all dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon \u2013 South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Esbozo gramatical de la lengua nasa (lengua p\u00e1ez)|last=Rojas|first=Tulio|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Consonants\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|p\n|p\u02b2\n|t\n|t\u02b2\n|k\n|k\u02b2\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|p\u02b0\n|p\u02b2\u02b0\n|t\u02b0\n|t\u02b2\u02b0\n|k\u02b0\n|k\u02b2\u02b0\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\u1d50b\n|\u1d50b\u02b2\n|\u207fd\n|\u207fd\u02b2\n|\u1d51\u0261\n|\u1d51\u0261\u02b2\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\u02b0\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\n|\n|\u207fd\u0361z\n|\u207fd\u0361\u0292\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\u0278\u02b2\n|s\n|\u0283\n|x\n|x\u02b2\n|-\n!<small>voiced</small>\n|\n|\u03b2\u02b2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n!<small>lateral</small>\n|\n|\n|l\n|\u028e\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|}\n[[File:Nasa yuwe tale.jpg|thumb|Nasa yuwe tale]]\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for Paez, Nasayuw\u00e4, Okoshkoky\u00e9wa, Paniquita, and Panzaleo.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!

(Unattested.)\n\n==History==\nAlthough many Colombian indigenous languages have disappeared since colonial times, there are still more than 60 languages in Colombia, classified into 10 linguistic families: [[Chibchan languages|Chibcha]], [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]], [[Cariban languages|Caribe]], [[Quechuan languages|Quichua]], [[Tucanoan languages|Tukano]], [[Guajiboan languages|Guahibo]], [[Macro-Puinavean languages|Mak\u00fa-Puinave]], [[Bora-Witoto languages|Witoto-Bora]], [[Piaroa-Saliban languages|S\u00e1liba]], and [[Choco languages|Choc\u00f3]]. Currently, the Chibcha family has languages from [[Santa Marta]]: [[Arhuaco language|Arhuaco]], [[Kogi language|kogui]], [[Wiwa language|Wiwa]], [[U'wa language|Tunebo]], [[Bar\u00ed language|Motilone]], [[Chimila language|Chimila]] and [[Kuna language|Cuna]], but it used to be believed that Nasa Yuwe was part of the Chibcha family.\n\nAgriculture is the basis of the people's economy and so they have been fighting to expand their fields. With territorial expansion, they could spread out their own language. For instance, Nasa Yuwe speakers could recently develop their culture in the east and the west of their own township.\n\nThe language has been endangered for many centuries. The first threat against the language was in the 17th century, with the imposition of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for education in Colombia.\n\nIn the 20th century, people believed that Nasa Yuwe had roots from Chibcha, but the former language is now considered an isolate. Also, in the P\u00e1ez townships, there are many groups of Guambianos that allow the creation of some linguistic variations and bilingualism.\n\nIn education, the Nasa Yuwe were oppressed by the dominant culture, which wanted them to become Colombian citizens. Schooling was partly to civilize the indigenous; children who spoke in their native language were punished such as by being forced to kneel on grains of corn for hours. Thus, people were forced to avoid their native language.\n\n==Revitalization==\nWith the General Law of Education, ethnoeducation is the opportunity of education for ethnic groups, but education needs to be related to the culture, traditions, language, and native elements of ethnic groups. To achieve the goal to give importance to indigenous languages, it is important to ensure that future indigenous generations preserve and relearn languages that do not have social privilege in Colombian society. Thus, it was necessary to implement booklets and original content material in the different languages.\n\nAlthough the government proposed the introduction of education of native languages in some communities, the preservation of languages and identities has been neglected. It is important to revitalize the language because it is part of the identity of many people who have been not considered part of Colombian society.\n\nThe first step is for the native teachers to know all the academic aspects and the sociocultural aspects of the ethnic group. The next is the creation of a campaign to promote the importance of the language in a minority community to maintain identity. The goal of the campaign is to reinforce the use of the language in the education environment and the family environment because they are children's first and most influential contacts. The last step is to promote the project to being used with other endangered languages of our country and revitalize them. Also, it is also necessary to create a conscience in the rest of the society to avoid the marginalization of the people who speak these native languages.\n\n== Phonology ==\nPaez has four vowel sounds: /i, e, a, u/. Each vowel demonstrates nasalization /\u0129 \u1ebd \u00e3 \u0169/, aspiration /i\u02b0 e\u02b0 a\u02b0 u\u02b0/, and vowel length /i\u02d0 e\u02d0 a\u02d0 u\u02d0/, all of which are contrastive. In addition, each vowel sound can be laryngealized /\u1e2d \u1e1b a\u0330 \u1e75/. Laryngealization can occur to nasalized or plain vowels, but not to lengthened vowels, while nasalization can occur to a plain or lengthened vowel. However, vowel length is not contrastive in all dialects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon|title=SAPhon \u2013 South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Esbozo gramatical de la lengua nasa (lengua p\u00e1ez)|last=Rojas|first=Tulio|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Consonants\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n![[Palatalization (phonetics)|<small>palatalized</small>]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|p\n|p\u02b2\n|t\n|t\u02b2\n|k\n|k\u02b2\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|p\u02b0\n|p\u02b2\u02b0\n|t\u02b0\n|t\u02b2\u02b0\n|k\u02b0\n|k\u02b2\u02b0\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\u1d50b\n|\u1d50b\u02b2\n|\u207fd\n|\u207fd\u02b2\n|\u1d51\u0261\n|\u1d51\u0261\u02b2\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\n|t\u0361\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Aspirated consonant|<small>aspirated</small>]]\n|\n|\n|t\u0361s\u02b0\n|t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\n|\n|\n|-\n![[Prenasalized consonant|<small>prenasalized</small>]]\n|\n|\n|\u207fd\u0361z\n|\u207fd\u0361\u0292\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\u0278\u02b2\n|s\n|\u0283\n|x\n|x\u02b2\n|-\n!<small>voiced</small>\n|\n|\u03b2\u02b2\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n!<small>lateral</small>\n|\n|\n|l\n|\u028e\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>plain</small>\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|w\n|\n|}\n[[File:Nasa yuwe tale.jpg|thumb|Nasa yuwe tale]]\n\n==Vocabulary==\n[[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968) lists the following basic vocabulary items for Paez, Nasayuw\u00e4, Okoshkoky\u00e9wa, Paniquita, and Panzaleo.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! gloss !!

It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

International]] cricket match between the [[England women's cricket team]] and the [[New Zealand women's national cricket team]], played on 22 March 2009 at the [[North Sydney Oval]] in Australia. It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

The name \"Misumalpan\" was devised by [[John Alden Mason]] and is composed of syllables from the names of the family's three members [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages]] and [[Matagalpa language|Matagalpan]].<ref>Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 33</ref> It was first recognized by [[Walter Lehmann (ethnologist)|Walter Lehmann]] in 1920. While all the languages of the Matagalpan branch are now extinct, the Miskito and Sumu languages are alive and well: Miskito has almost 200,000 speakers and serves as a second language for speakers of other Indian languages on the [[Mosquito Coast]]. According to Hale,<ref name=\"Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35\"/> most speakers of Sumu also speak Miskito.\n\nKaufman (1990) finds a connection with [[Macro-Chibchan languages|Macro-Chibchan]] to be \"convincing\", but Misumalpan specialist [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] considered a possible connection between Chibchan and Misumalpan to be \"too distant to establish\".<ref name=\"Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35\">Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35</ref>. On the other hand, a new research (Jolkesky 2017:45-54) has found compelling evidence linking the Misumalpan language family and the [[Hokan]] stock.\n\n==Classification==\n* [[Miskito language|Miskito]] \u2013 nearly 200,000 speakers, mainly in the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] of [[Nicaragua]], but including some in [[Honduras]].\n* Sumalpan languages:\n** [[Sumo languages]] \u2013 some 8,000 speakers along the Huaspuc River and its tributaries, most in [[Nicaragua]] but some in [[Honduras]].  Many of them have shifted to Miskito.\n*** Mayangna - dominant variety of the Sumo family\n*** Ulwa\n** Matagalpan\n*** [[Cacaopera language|Cacaopera]] \u2020 \u2013 formerly spoken in the [[Moraz\u00e1n Department|Moraz\u00e1n]] department of [[El Salvador]]; and\n*** [[Matagalpa language|Matagalpa]]  \u2020 \u2013 formerly spoken in the central highlands of [[Nicaragua]] and the [[El Para\u00edso department|El Para\u00edso]] department of [[Honduras]]\n\nMiskito became the dominant language of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the late 17th century on, as a result of the people's alliance with the British Empire, which colonized the area. In northeastern Nicaragua, it continues to be adopted by former speakers of Sumo.  Its sociolinguistic status is lower than that of the English-based [[creole language|creole]] of the southeast, and in that region, Miskito seems to be losing ground.  Sumo is endangered in most areas where it is found, although some evidence suggests that it was dominant in the region before the ascendancy of Miskito.  The Matagalpan languages are long since extinct, and not very well documented.\n\nAll Misumalpan languages share the same phonology, apart from [[phonotactics]].  The consonants are p, b, t, d, k, s, h, w, y, and [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[voiceless]] versions of m, n, ng, l, r; the vowels are short and long versions of a, i, u.\n\n===Loukotka (1968)===\nBelow is a full list of Misumalpan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n;Mosquito group\n*'''Mosquito''' / '''Miskito''' - language spoken on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, Central America.

The name \"Misumalpan\" was devised by [[John Alden Mason]] and is composed of syllables from the names of the family's three members [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages]] and [[Matagalpa language|Matagalpan]].<ref>Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 33</ref> It was first recognized by [[Walter Lehmann (ethnologist)|Walter Lehmann]] in 1920. While all the languages of the Matagalpan branch are now extinct, the Miskito and Sumu languages are alive and well: Miskito has almost 200,000 speakers and serves as a second language for speakers of other Indian languages on the [[Mosquito Coast]]. According to Hale,<ref name=\"Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35\"/> most speakers of Sumu also speak Miskito.\n\nKaufman (1990) finds a connection with [[Macro-Chibchan languages|Macro-Chibchan]] to be \"convincing\", but Misumalpan specialist [[Kenneth L. Hale|Ken Hale]] considered a possible connection between Chibchan and Misumalpan to be \"too distant to establish\".<ref name=\"Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35\">Hale & Salamanca 2001, p. 35</ref>. On the other hand, a new research (Jolkesky 2017:45-54) has found compelling evidence linking the Misumalpan language family and the [[Hokan]] stock.\n\n==Classification==\n* [[Miskito language|Miskito]] \u2013 nearly 200,000 speakers, mainly in the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]] of [[Nicaragua]], but including some in [[Honduras]].\n* Sumalpan languages:\n** [[Sumo languages]] \u2013 some 8,000 speakers along the Huaspuc River and its tributaries, most in [[Nicaragua]] but some in [[Honduras]].  Many of them have shifted to Miskito.\n*** Mayangna - dominant variety of the Sumo family\n*** Ulwa\n** Matagalpan\n*** [[Cacaopera language|Cacaopera]] \u2020 \u2013 formerly spoken in the [[Moraz\u00e1n Department|Moraz\u00e1n]] department of [[El Salvador]]; and\n*** [[Matagalpa language|Matagalpa]]  \u2020 \u2013 formerly spoken in the central highlands of [[Nicaragua]] and the [[El Para\u00edso department|El Para\u00edso]] department of [[Honduras]]\n\nMiskito became the dominant language of the [[Mosquito Coast]] from the late 17th century on, as a result of the people's alliance with the British Empire, which colonized the area. In northeastern Nicaragua, it continues to be adopted by former speakers of Sumo.  Its sociolinguistic status is lower than that of the English-based [[creole language|creole]] of the southeast, and in that region, Miskito seems to be losing ground.  Sumo is endangered in most areas where it is found, although some evidence suggests that it was dominant in the region before the ascendancy of Miskito.  The Matagalpan languages are long since extinct, and not very well documented.\n\nAll Misumalpan languages share the same phonology, apart from [[phonotactics]].  The consonants are p, b, t, d, k, s, h, w, y, and [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[voiceless]] versions of m, n, ng, l, r; the vowels are short and long versions of a, i, u.\n\n===Loukotka (1968)===\nBelow is a full list of Misumalpan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n;Mosquito group\n*'''Mosquito''' / '''Miskito''' - language spoken on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, Central America.

{"title_page": "Vertical service code", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2019}}\nA '''vertical service code''' ('''VSC''') is a sequence of digits and the signals [[asterisk|star]] (*) and [[number sign]] (#) dialed on a [[telephone keypad]] or [[rotary dial]] to enable or disable certain telephony service features.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some vertical service codes require dialing of a [[telephone number]] after the code sequence. On a [[touch tone]] telephone, the codes are usually initiated with the [[asterisk|star key]], resulting in the commonly used name ''star codes''. On rotary dial telephones, the star is replaced by dialing ''11''.\n\nIn [[North American]] [[telephony]], VSCs were developed by [[AT&T Corp.]] as '''Custom Local Area Signaling Services''' ('''CLASS''' or '''LASS''') codes in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard. As ''CLASS'' was an AT&T trademark, the term ''vertical service code'' was adopted by the [[North American Numbering Plan Administration]]. The use of ''vertical'' is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a local telephone subscriber, going up (''vertically'') inside the local [[telephone exchange|central office]] instead of out (''horizontally'') to another telephone company.\n\n==Feature definitions ==\n===North America===\nThe following are the vertical service codes generally recommended by the [[North American Numbering Plan Administration]] for use in the NANP territories.

On rotary dial telephones, the star is replaced by dialing ''11''.\n\nIn [[North American]] [[telephony]], VSCs were developed by [[AT&T Corp.]] as '''Custom Local Area Signaling Services''' ('''CLASS''' or '''LASS''') codes in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard\n. As ''CLASS'' was an AT&T trademark, the term ''vertical service code'' was adopted by the [[North American Numbering Plan Administration]]. The use of ''vertical'' is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a local telephone subscriber, going up (''vertically'') inside the local [[telephone exchange|central office]] instead of out (''horizontally'') to another telephone company.\n\n==Feature definitions ==\n===North America===\nThe following are the vertical service codes generally recommended by the [[North American Numbering Plan Administration]] for use in the NANP territories. Not all of these services are available in all areas, and some are only available to [[landline]] or [[Mobile phone|cellular]] telephones.\n\nLocal Area Signalling Services (LASS) and Custom Calling Feature Control Codes:<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=The #hack FAQ|url=http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=47&id=7|author=voyager|editor=Erik Bloodaxe|work=Phrack Magazine|page=7|date=1995-04-15|accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title=Vertical Service Codes \u2013 Code Definitions|url=http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/vsc_definitions.html|publisher=Neustar|work=NANPA.com|accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Vertical Service Codes \u2013 Code Assignments|url=http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/vsc_assignments.html|publisher=Neustar|work=NANPA.com|accessdate=2013-03-18}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+\n|-\n! colspan=2|Vertical service code || rowspan=2 | Service definition\n|-\n!
