Written by [[Greg Daniels]] and directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], the episode first aired in the United States on January 5, 2006 on [[NBC]]. The episode featured [[Rob Riggle]] and [[Amy Adams]] as guest stars.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) brings the office on a [[booze cruise]] and plans on doing some [[motivational speaking|\"motivational\" speaking]]. After he learns that the captain of the boat has other plans, a power struggle emerges. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy]]'s ([[David Denman]]) previously stagnant relationship blossoms, while [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and Katy's ([[Amy Adams]]) begins to falter.\n\nThe story for \"Booze Cruise\" was inspired by a friend of [[B. J. Novak]]'s who had gone on a booze cruise. Novak told Daniels about the trip, and Daniels then proceeded to write an episode about it. The episode featured the third and final appearance of Katy, portrayed by Amy Adams. The filming of the episode was a departure from the norm of the series; filming took place on an actual boat and because of this, many cast members got seasick. \"Booze Cruise\" received largely positive reviews from critics. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 4.5 in the 18\u201349 demographic and was viewed by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe [[Dunder Mifflin]] crew goes on a cruise on a [[Lake Wallenpaupack]] ship ''Princess''\u2014in January. [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) plans to use the cruise as both a party and a leadership training exercise. However, \"Captain Jack\" ([[Rob Riggle]]) keeps preventing him from giving a business lecture and compromises his metaphor involving himself as \"captain\" of the office.\n\nThe captain puts [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) in charge of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), who has brought his girlfriend [[Katy Moore]] ([[Amy Adams]]) on the cruise, and [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their significant others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, the passengers panic, one of them grabbing a life vest and jumping off the ship. The captain temporarily detains Michael by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.\n\nAfter hearing a war story from the captain, a drunken [[Roy Anderson (The Office)|Roy Anderson]] ([[David Denman]]) is inspired to announce a date for his wedding with Pam. Jim is crushed and breaks up with Katy, realizing that he does not want to be with her. He confesses his feelings for Pam to Michael, who acts surprised and claims Jim hid his feelings well. Michael encourages him to not give up on Pam.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Amy Adams (29708985502) (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Amy Adams]] guest starred for the last time in the episode, playing Katy.]] \n\n\"Booze Cruise\" was written by [[Greg Daniels]], making it his fourth writing credit, and his second season two credit, after \"[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]]\" earlier in the year.<ref name=\"DVD2\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete First Season |titlelink=The Office (U.S. season 1) |year=2005 |others=[[Ken Kwapis]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref><ref name=\"halloween\">{{cite episode |title=Halloween  |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |credits=[[Greg Daniels]] (writer); [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 18, 2005 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref> The episode was directed by [[Ken Kwapis]], making it his sixth directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"DVD2\"/><ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Office: The Complete Second Season |titlelink=The Office (American season 2) |year=2005{{ndash}}2006 |others=[[Greg Daniels]], et al |type=on-screen |publisher=[[NBC]]}}</ref> [[Greg Daniels]] referred to this episode as \"our [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] version of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Office A to Z|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417220416/http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Z-10830.aspx|archivedate=April 17, 2009|date=November 5, 2007}}</ref> The idea came from [[B.

[[Solinus]] write that the city of [[Metauros]] was established by people from the Zancle.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/747#8.7 Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10]</ref>  \n\nIn the early 5th century BC, [[Anaxilas of Rhegium]] renamed it '''Messene''' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}) in honour of the Greek city [[Messene]] (See also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). Later, [[Micythus]] was the ruler of [[Rhegium]] and Zancle, and he also founded the city of [[Pyxus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:11.59 Diodorus Siculus, Library, \u00a7 11.59.1]</ref>\nThe city was [[Battle of Messene|sacked in 397 BC]] by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and then reconquered by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n[[File:Beaches,Messina.JPG|thumb|a tract of around 30 kilometres of [[beaches]] of Messina]]\n[[File:Feluca in the strait of Messina.JPG|thumb|the  ''Feluca'', a typical boat used by the fishermen of Messina to hunt [[swordfish]] ]]\n\nIn 288 BC the [[Mamertines]] seized the city by treachery, killing all the men and taking the women as their wives. The city became a base from which they ravaged the countryside, leading to a conflict with the expanding regional empire of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. [[Hiero II]], tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near [[Mylae]] on the [[Longanus River]] and besieged Messina. [[Carthage]] assisted the Mamertines because of a [[Sicilian Wars|long-standing conflict]] with Syracuse over dominance in Sicily. When Hiero attacked a second time in 264 BC, the Mamertines petitioned the [[Roman Republic]] for an alliance, hoping for more reliable protection. Although initially reluctant to assist lest it encourage other mercenary groups to mutiny, Rome was unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and encroach on Italy. Rome therefore entered into an alliance with the Mamertines. In 264 BC, Roman troops were deployed to Sicily, the first time a Roman army acted outside the [[Italian Peninsula]]. At the end of the [[First Punic War]] it was a free city allied with Rome. In Roman times Messina, then known as '''Messana''', had an important [[History of lighthouses|pharos]] (lighthouse). Messana was the base of [[Sextus Pompeius]], during his war against [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was successively ruled by [[Goths]] from 476, then by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 535, by the [[Arabs]] in 842, and in 1061 by the [[Normans|Norman]] brothers [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger Guiscard]] (later count Roger I of Sicily). In 1189 the English King [[Richard I of England|Richard I (''\"The Lionheart\"'')]] stopped at Messina en route to the [[Holy Land]] for the [[Third Crusade]] and briefly occupied the city after a dispute over the dowry of his sister, who had been married to [[William the Good, King of Sicily]]. In 1345 [[Orlando d'Aragona]], illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II of Sicily]] was the ''[[strategos]]'' of Messina.\n\nIn 1347, Messina was one of the first points of entry for the [[black death]] into Western Europe. [[Genoa|Genoese]] galleys traveling from the infected city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] carried plague into the Messina ports. Kaffa had been infected via Asian trade routes and siege from infected [[Mongol]] armies led by [[Janibeg]]; it was a departure point for many Italian merchants who fled the city to Sicily. Contemporary accounts from Messina tell of the arrival of \"Death Ships\" from the East, which floated to shore with all the passengers on board already dead or dying of plague. Plague-infected rats probably also came aboard these ships. The black death ravaged Messina, and rapidly spread northward into mainland Italy from Sicily in the following few months.\n\nIn 1548 [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] founded there the first [[Jesuit]] college in the world, which later gave birth to the ''Studium Generale'' (the current [[University of Messina]]). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Christian ships that won the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] left from Messina: the [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who took part in the battle, recovered for some time in the ''Grand Hospital''. The city reached the peak of its splendour in the early 17th century, under Spanish domination: at the time it was one of the ten greatest cities in Europe. \n\nIn 1674 the city [[Messina revolt|rebelled against the foreign garrison]]. It managed to remain independent for some time, thanks to the help of the French king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but in 1678, with the [[Peace of Nijmegen]], it was reconquered by the Spaniards and sacked: the university, the senate and all the privileges of autonomy it had enjoyed since the Roman times were abolished. A [[Real Cittadella|massive fortress]] was built by the occupants and Messina decayed steadily. In 1743, 48,000 died of a second wave of [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2630035 \"Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague\"] by Samuel K Cohn JR. ''Medical History''.</ref>\n\nIn 1783, an [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] devastated much of the city, and it took decades to rebuild and rekindle the cultural life of Messina. In 1847 it was one of the first cities in Italy where [[Risorgimento]] riots broke out. In 1848 it rebelled openly against the reigning [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], but was heavily suppressed again. Only in 1860, after the [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|Battle of Milazzo]], the [[Garibaldi]]ne troops occupied the city. One of the main figures of the [[unification of Italy]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], was elected [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] at Messina in the general elections of 1866. Another earthquake of less intensity damaged the city on 16 November 1894. The city was almost entirely destroyed by [[1908 Messina earthquake|an earthquake]] and associated [[tsunami]] on the morning of 28 December 1908, killing about 100,000 people and destroying most of the ancient architecture. The city was largely rebuilt in the following year. \n\n{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}\nIt incurred further damage from the massive Allied air bombardments of 1943; before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. Messina, owing to its strategic importance as a transit point for Axis troops and supplies sent to Sicily from mainland Italy, was a prime target for the British and American air forces, which dropped some 6,500 tons of bombs in the span of a few months.<ref>[http://www.societaitalianastoriamilitare.org/COLLANA%20SISM/2014%20DONATO%20La%20Piazza%20di%20Messina%201939-1943.pdf La Piazza Marittima di Messina (1939-1943)]</ref> These raids destroyed one third of the city, and caused 854 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.tempostretto.it/news/proposta-proposta-istituzione-giornata-memoria-854-messinesi-morti-sotto-bombardamenti-43.html Proposta l\u2019istituzione di una \u201cgiornata della memoria\u201d degli 854 messinesi morti sotto i bombardamenti del \u201843]</ref> The city was awarded a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] and one for Civil Valor by the Italian government in memory of the event and the subsequent effort of reconstruction.<ref>[https://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/18388 Presidenza della Repubblica]</ref>\n\nIn June 1955, Messina was the location of the [[Messina Conference]] of [[Western Europe]]an [[foreign minister]]s which led to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-history.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=10&c=52|title='&#39;The Messina Declaration 1955'&#39; final document of '&#39;The Conference of Messina'&#39; 1 to 3 June 1955 \u2013 birth of the European Union|publisher=Eu-history.leidenuniv.nl|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> The conference was held mainly in Messina's [[Palazzo Zanca|City Hall building]] ([[:it:Palazzo Zanca|it]]), and partly in nearby [[Taormina]]. \n\nThe city is home to a small [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] minority, which arrived from the [[Peloponnese]] between 1533-34 when fleeing from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The building had to be almost entirely rebuilt in 1919\u201320, following the devastating [[1908 Messina earthquake|1908 earthquake]], and again in 1943, after a fire triggered by Allied bombings. The original [[Norman architecture|Norman]] structure can be recognised in the apsidal area. The fa\u00e7ade has three late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portals, the central of which probably dates back to the early 15th century. The architrave is decorated with a sculpture of ''Christ Among the Evangelists'' and various representations of men, animals and plants. The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] dates back to 1468. The interior is organised in a nave and two equally long aisles divided by files of 28 columns. Some decorative elements belong the original building, although the mosaics in the [[apse]] are reconstructions. Tombs of illustrious men besides Conrad IV include those of Archbishops Palmer (died in 1195), Guidotto de Abbiate (14th century) and Antonio La Legname (16th century). Special interest is held by the Chapel of the Sacrament (late 16th century), with scenic decorations and 14th century mosaics. The [[bell tower]] holds the [[Messina astronomical clock]], one of the largest astronomical clocks in the world, built in 1933 by the Ungerer Company of [[Strasbourg]].

It has a cylindrical apse and a high dome emerging from a high [[tambour]]. Noteworthy is the external decoration of the [[transept]] and the dome area, with a series of blind arches separated by small columns, clearly reflecting Arabic architectural influences.\n* The Church of Santa Maria degli Alemanni (early 13th century), which was formerly a chapel of the [[Teutonic Knights]].

A ''[[comune]]'' of its Metropolitan City, located at the southern entrance of the [[Strait of Messina]], is to this day called 'Scaletta Zanclea'. [[Solinus]] write that the city of [[Metauros]] was established by people from the Zancle.<ref>[https://topostext.org/work/747#8.7 Solinus, Polyhistor, 2.10]</ref>  \n\nIn the early 5th century BC, [[Anaxilas of Rhegium]] renamed it '''Messene''' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}) in honour of the Greek city [[Messene]] (See also [[List of traditional Greek place names]]). Later, [[Micythus]] was the ruler of [[Rhegium]] and Zancle, and he also founded the city of [[Pyxus]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0060.tlg001.perseus-grc3:11.59 Diodorus Siculus, Library, \u00a7 11.59.1]</ref>\nThe city was [[Battle of Messene|sacked in 397 BC]] by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and then reconquered by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n[[File:Beaches,Messina.JPG|thumb|a tract of around 30 kilometres of [[beaches]] of Messina]]\n[[File:Feluca in the strait of Messina.JPG|thumb|the  ''Feluca'', a typical boat used by the fishermen of Messina to hunt [[swordfish]] ]]\n\nIn 288 BC the [[Mamertines]] seized the city by treachery, killing all the men and taking the women as their wives. The city became a base from which they ravaged the countryside, leading to a conflict with the expanding regional empire of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. [[Hiero II]], tyrant of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near [[Mylae]] on the [[Longanus River]] and besieged Messina. [[Carthage]] assisted the Mamertines because of a [[Sicilian Wars|long-standing conflict]] with Syracuse over dominance in Sicily. When Hiero attacked a second time in 264 BC, the Mamertines petitioned the [[Roman Republic]] for an alliance, hoping for more reliable protection. Although initially reluctant to assist lest it encourage other mercenary groups to mutiny, Rome was unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and encroach on Italy. Rome therefore entered into an alliance with the Mamertines. In 264 BC, Roman troops were deployed to Sicily, the first time a Roman army acted outside the [[Italian Peninsula]]. At the end of the [[First Punic War]] it was a free city allied with Rome. In Roman times Messina, then known as '''Messana''', had an important [[History of lighthouses|pharos]] (lighthouse). Messana was the base of [[Sextus Pompeius]], during his war against [[Caesar Augustus|Octavian]].\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was successively ruled by [[Goths]] from 476, then by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 535, by the [[Arabs]] in 842, and in 1061 by the [[Normans|Norman]] brothers [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger Guiscard]] (later count Roger I of Sicily). In 1189 the English King [[Richard I of England|Richard I (''\"The Lionheart\"'')]] stopped at Messina en route to the [[Holy Land]] for the [[Third Crusade]] and briefly occupied the city after a dispute over the dowry of his sister, who had been married to [[William the Good, King of Sicily]]. In 1345 [[Orlando d'Aragona]], illegitimate son of [[Frederick III of Sicily|Frederick II of Sicily]] was the ''[[strategos]]'' of Messina.\n\nIn 1347, Messina was one of the first points of entry for the [[black death]] into Western Europe. [[Genoa|Genoese]] galleys traveling from the infected city of [[Feodosia|Kaffa]] carried plague into the Messina ports. Kaffa had been infected via Asian trade routes and siege from infected [[Mongol]] armies led by [[Janibeg]]; it was a departure point for many Italian merchants who fled the city to Sicily. Contemporary accounts from Messina tell of the arrival of \"Death Ships\" from the East, which floated to shore with all the passengers on board already dead or dying of plague. Plague-infected rats probably also came aboard these ships. The black death ravaged Messina, and rapidly spread northward into mainland Italy from Sicily in the following few months.\n\nIn 1548 [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]] founded there the first [[Jesuit]] college in the world, which later gave birth to the ''Studium Generale'' (the current [[University of Messina]]). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Christian ships that won the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] left from Messina: the [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who took part in the battle, recovered for some time in the ''Grand Hospital''. The city reached the peak of its splendour in the early 17th century, under Spanish domination: at the time it was one of the ten greatest cities in Europe. \n\nIn 1674 the city [[Messina revolt|rebelled against the foreign garrison]]. It managed to remain independent for some time, thanks to the help of the French king [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but in 1678, with the [[Peace of Nijmegen]], it was reconquered by the Spaniards and sacked: the university, the senate and all the privileges of autonomy it had enjoyed since the Roman times were abolished. A [[Real Cittadella|massive fortress]] was built by the occupants and Messina decayed steadily. In 1743, 48,000 died of a second wave of [[plague (disease)|plague]] in the city.<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2630035 \"Epidemiology of the Black Death and Successive Waves of Plague\"] by Samuel K Cohn JR. ''Medical History''.</ref>\n\nIn 1783, an [[1783 Calabrian earthquakes|earthquake]] devastated much of the city, and it took decades to rebuild and rekindle the cultural life of Messina. In 1847 it was one of the first cities in Italy where [[Risorgimento]] riots broke out. In 1848 it rebelled openly against the reigning [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], but was heavily suppressed again. Only in 1860, after the [[Battle of Milazzo (1860)|Battle of Milazzo]], the [[Garibaldi]]ne troops occupied the city. One of the main figures of the [[unification of Italy]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], was elected [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|deputy]] at Messina in the general elections of 1866. Another earthquake of less intensity damaged the city on 16 November 1894. The city was almost entirely destroyed by [[1908 Messina earthquake|an earthquake]] and associated [[tsunami]] on the morning of 28 December 1908, killing about 100,000 people and destroying most of the ancient architecture. The city was largely rebuilt in the following year. \n\n{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}\nIt incurred further damage from the massive Allied air bombardments of 1943; before and during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] Messina, owing to its strategic importance as a transit point for Axis troops and supplies sent to Sicily from mainland Italy, was a prime target for the British and American air forces, which dropped some 6,500 tons of bombs in the span of a few months.<ref>[http://www.societaitalianastoriamilitare.org/COLLANA%20SISM/2014%20DONATO%20La%20Piazza%20di%20Messina%201939-1943.pdf La Piazza Marittima di Messina (1939-1943)]</ref> These raids destroyed one third of the city, and caused 854 deaths among the population.<ref>[https://www.tempostretto.it/news/proposta-proposta-istituzione-giornata-memoria-854-messinesi-morti-sotto-bombardamenti-43.html Proposta l\u2019istituzione di una \u201cgiornata della memoria\u201d degli 854 messinesi morti sotto i bombardamenti del \u201843]</ref> The city was awarded a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] and one for Civil Valor by the Italian government in memory of the event and the subsequent effort of reconstruction.<ref>[https://www.quirinale.it/onorificenze/insigniti/18388 Presidenza della Repubblica]</ref>\n\nIn June 1955, Messina was the location of the [[Messina Conference]] of [[Western Europe]]an [[foreign minister]]s which led to the creation of the [[European Economic Community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-history.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=10&c=52|title='&#39;The Messina Declaration 1955'&#39; final document of '&#39;The Conference of Messina'&#39; 1 to 3 June 1955 \u2013 birth of the European Union|publisher=Eu-history.leidenuniv.nl|accessdate=5 April 2011}}</ref> The conference was held mainly in Messina's [[Palazzo Zanca|City Hall building]] ([[:it:Palazzo Zanca|it]]), and partly in nearby [[Taormina]]. \n\nThe city is home to a small [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] minority, which arrived from the [[Peloponnese]] between 1533-34 when fleeing from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The building had to be almost entirely rebuilt in 1919\u201320, following the devastating [[1908 Messina earthquake|1908 earthquake]], and again in 1943, after a fire triggered by Allied bombings. The original [[Norman architecture|Norman]] structure can be recognised in the apsidal area. The fa\u00e7ade has three late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portals, the central of which probably dates back to the early 15th century. The architrave is decorated with a sculpture of ''Christ Among the Evangelists'' and various representations of men, animals and plants. The [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] dates back to 1468. The interior is organised in a nave and two equally long aisles divided by files of 28 columns. Some decorative elements belong the original building, although the mosaics in the [[apse]] are reconstructions. Tombs of illustrious men besides Conrad IV include those of Archbishops Palmer (died in 1195), Guidotto de Abbiate (14th century) and Antonio La Legname (16th century). Special interest is held by the Chapel of the Sacrament (late 16th century), with scenic decorations and 14th century mosaics. The [[bell tower]] holds the [[Messina astronomical clock]], one of the largest astronomical clocks in the world, built in 1933 by the Ungerer Company of [[Strasbourg]]. The belfry's mechanically-animated statues, which illustrate events from the civil and religious history of the city every day at noon, are a popular tourist attraction.\n* The Sanctuary of Santa Maria del Carmelo (near the Courthouse), built in 1931, which contains a 17th-century statue of the Virgin Mary. See also [[Chiesa del Carmine (Messina)|Chiesa del Carmine]].\n* The Sanctuary of Montevergine, where the [[incorruptibility|incorrupt]] body of [[Saint]] [[Eustochia Smeralda Calafato]] is preserved.\n* The [[Church of the Santissima Annunziata dei Catalani]] (late 12th\u201313th century). Dating from the late Norman period, it was transformed in the 13th century when the nave was shortened and the fa\u00e7ade added.
