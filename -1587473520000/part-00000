In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nGood animation tools for beginners\n-rough animator\n-animation pro\n-procreate\n-adobe animate\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], television series, animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first-ever animated feature, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of June 2014.<ref name=\"snowwhite1\">* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"snowwhite2\">* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release \u2013 $46,594,212; 1993 release \u2013 $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Tweening===\nWhen animating in programs like adobe animate, animators use key frames to draw/plan out the frames that they want the animation to pass through.\nThe animation program fills in the rest of the frames in different kinds of tweens.\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010). Traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include ''[[The Lion King]]'' (US, 1994), ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (US, 1998), ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (Japan, 1988),{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=80}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japan, 2001), ''[[The Triplets of Belleville]]'' (France, 2003), and ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' (Irish-French-Belgian, 2009).\n\n==== Full animation ====\n'''Full animation''' refers to the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement,{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=71}} having a smooth animation.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|pp=194\u201395}} Fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles, from more realistically animated works like those produced by the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney studio]] (''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''The Lion King'') to the more 'cartoon' styles of the [[Warner Bros.

Many of the [[Disney animated features]] are examples of full animation, as are non-Disney works, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (US, 1982), ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (US, 1999), and ''[[Nocturna (Film)|Nocturna]]'' (Spain, 2007). Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}. Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks created a series of ''[[Alice comedies]]'' (1923-1927), in which a live-action girl enters an animated world. Other examples include ''[[Allegro Non Troppo]]'' (Italy, 1976), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (US, 1988), ''[[Space Jam]]'' (US, 1996) and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'' (US, 2001).\n\n=== Stop motion animation ===\n{{Main|Stop motion}}\n\n'''Stop-motion animation''' is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real-world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}} There are many different types of stop-motion animation, usually named after the medium used to create the animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}} Computer software is widely available to create this type of animation; traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time-consuming to produce than current computer animation.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=159}}\n* '''[[Puppet animation]]''' typically involves stop-motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment, in contrast to real-world interaction in model animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=171}} The puppets generally have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=155\u201356}} Examples include ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (France, 1937), ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (US, 1993), ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (US, 2005), ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (US, 2009), the films of [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]] and the adult animated sketch-comedy television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' (US, 2005\u2013present).\n** '''[[Puppetoon]]''', created using techniques developed by [[George Pal]],{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=70}} are puppet-animated films that typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames, rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n[[File:Claychick.jpg|thumb|A clay animation scene from a [[Finland|Finnish]] television commercial]]\n* '''[[Clay animation]]''', or [[Plasticine]] animation (often called ''claymation'', which, however, is a [[Laika (company)|trademarked]] name), uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop-motion animation.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=299}}{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=150\u2013151}} The figures may have an [[armature (sculpture)|armature]] or wire frame inside, similar to the related puppet animation (below), that can be manipulated to pose the figures.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=151\u201354}} Alternatively, the figures may be made entirely of clay, in the films of [[Bruce Bickford (animator)|Bruce Bickford]], where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes.

In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent [[cel|celluloid sheets]] to be photographed and exhibited on [[film]]. Today, most animations are made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Computer animation]] can be very detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D animation]], while [[2D computer graphics|2D computer animation]] can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster [[real-time rendering]]s. Other common animation methods apply a [[stop motion]] technique to two and three-dimensional objects like [[cutout animation|paper cutouts]], [[puppet]]s or [[Clay animation|clay figures]].\n\nCommonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion\u2014as in motion pictures in general\u2014is thought to rely on the [[phi phenomenon]] and [[beta movement]], but the exact causes are still uncertain.\n[[Analog device|Analog]] mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]], [[zoetrope]], [[flip book]], [[praxinoscope]] and film. [[Television]] and [[video]] are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate [[digital media|digitally]]. For display on the computer, techniques like [[animated GIF]] and [[Flash animation]] were developed.\n\nAnimation is more pervasive than many people realize. Apart from [[short films]], [[feature films]], television series, animated GIF's and other media dedicated to the display of moving images, animation is also prevalent in [[video game]]s, [[motion graphics]], [[user interface]]s and [[visual effects]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=pervasive+animation&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Pervasive Animation|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|date=22 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136519550}}</ref>\n\nThe physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics \u2013 in for instance moving images in [[magic lantern]] shows \u2013 can also be considered animation. The mechanical manipulation of three-dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in [[automaton|automata]]. Electronic automata were popularized by [[Disney]] as [[animatronics]].\n\n[[Animator]]s are artists who specialize in creating animation.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"animation\" stems from the Latin \"anim\u0101ti\u014dn\", stem of \"anim\u0101ti\u014d\", meaning \"a bestowing of life\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/animation | title=The definition of animation on dictionary.com}}</ref> The primary meaning of the English word is \"liveliness\" and has been in use much longer than the meaning of \"moving image medium\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of animation}}\n\n===Before cinematography===\nAlthough examples of sequential images can be found occasionally throughout the history of art, there is no evidence of any related technology that enabled the artists to view such series in motion before 1832. Other ways to create moving images, by manipulating figures by hand or with mechanics, can be recognized in [[puppetry]], [[automaton|automata]], [[shadow play]] and (since around 1659) the [[magic lantern]].\n\n[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky & Vieweg in 1833.]]\nIn 1833, the [[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, which would also provide the basis for the [[zoetrope]] (1866), the [[flip book]] (1868), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877), Muybridge's [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879) and [[cinematography]].\n\n[[File:Lanature1882 praxinoscope projection reynaud.png|thumb|A projecting [[praxinoscope]], 1882, here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene]]\nA few years before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895, [[Charles-\u00c9mile Reynaud]] had much success with his ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. These animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. Piano music, song, and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900, Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the [[Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin]] in Paris\n\n===Silent era===\nA few years after film became a popular medium, some manufacturers of optical toys produced many [[chromolithography]] film loops for adapted toy magic lanterns. These lanterns usually depicted images traced from live-action film footage. At a time when hardly any animations could be seen in theaters, kids would project these animation loops at home.\n \nSome early filmmakers, including [[J. Stuart Blackton]], [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]], [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]] and [[Edwin S. Porter]] experimented with [[stop-motion]] animation, possibly since around 1899, or, more likely, since 1906. Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) was the first huge stop motion success, baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves. The short film inspired other filmmakers to try the technique.\n\nJ. Stuart Blackton's ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) is usually regarded as the first animated film on [[standard picture film]] shown in theatres. It was partly animated on a chalkboard and partly with cut-outs.\n\n[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]]]\n[[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) is the oldest known example of what became known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]].\n\nGreat artistic and very influential animations were made by [[Ladislas Starevich]] with his puppet animations since 1910 and by [[Winsor McCay]] with detailed drawn animation in films such as ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911) and ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914). Gertie was also an early example of character development in drawn animation{{sfn|Canemaker|2005|p=171}} and featured a scene with a live-action recording of McCay interacting with Gertie in a drawn landscape.\n\nDuring the 1910s, the production of animated \"[[cartoons]]\" became an industry.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=28}} The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with animator [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=24}}{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character ''El Peludo'' (based on President [[Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen|Yrigoyen]]) patented in 1916 for the realization of his films, including the world's first animated feature film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\nIn 1917, Argentine director [[Quirino Cristiani]] made the first feature-length film ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (now lost), which became a critical and commercial success. It was followed by Cristiani's ''[[Sin dejar rastros]]'' in 1918, but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government.\n\nIn 1919, the silent animated short ''[[Feline Follies]]'' marked the debut of [[Felix the Cat]], becoming the first animated character in the silent film era to gain significant popularity.\n\nAfter working on it for three years, [[Lotte Reiniger]] released the German feature-length silhouette animation ''[[Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed]]'' in 1926, the oldest extant animated feature.\n\n===1928-1960s: Golden age of American animation===\nIn 1928, ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', featuring [[Mickey Mouse]], popularized film with synchronized sound and put [[Walt Disney]]'s studio at the forefront of the animation industry. In 1932, Disney also introduced the innovation of full colour (in ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'') as part of a three-year long exclusive deal with [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe enormous success of Mickey Mouse is seen as the start of the [[golden age of American animation]] that would last until 1960s. The United States dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel-animated theatrical shorts. Several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers, including [[Walt Disney Productions]]' [[Goofy]] (1932) and [[Donald Duck]] (1934), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]' [[Looney Tunes]] characters like [[Daffy Duck]] (1937), [[Bugs Bunny]] (1938/1940), [[Tweety]] (1941/1942), [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner]] (1949), [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Paramount Cartoon Studios]]' [[Betty Boop]] (1930), [[Popeye#Theatrical animated cartoons|Popeye]] (licensed by King Feature Syndicate) (1933), [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Superman]] (licensed by DC Comics) (1941) and [[Casper the friendly ghost|Casper]] (1945), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]]: [[Tom and Jerry]] (1940) and [[Droopy]], [[Walter Lantz Productions]]/[[Universal Studio Cartoons]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]] (1940), [[Terrytoons]]/[[20th Century Fox]]'s [[Mighty Mouse]] (1942) and [[United Artists]]' [[Pink Panther (character)|Pink Panther]] (1963).\n\n===Animated features before CGI===\nIn 1937, [[Walt Disney Studios]] premiered their first-ever animated feature, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], still one of the highest-grossing traditional animation features as of June 2014.<ref name=\"snowwhite1\">* Total prior to 50th anniversary reissue: {{cite news |last=Culhane |first=John |title='Snow White' At 50: Undimmed Magic |date=July 12, 1987 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=By now, it has grossed about $330&nbsp;million worldwide - so it remains one of the most popular films ever made. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604200704/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/movies/snow-white-at-50-undimmed-magic.html |archive-date=June 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"snowwhite2\">* 1987 and 1993 grosses from North America: {{cite web |title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \u2013 Releases |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |accessdate=June 29, 2014 |quote=1987 release \u2013 $46,594,212; 1993 release \u2013 $41,634,471 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529094807/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=releases&id=snowwhite.htm |archive-date=May 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with ''[[Gulliver's Travels (1939 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'' with some success. Partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the Second World War, Disney's next features ''[[Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (both 1940) and Fleischer Studios' second animated feature ''[[Mr. Bug Goes to Town]]'' (1941/1942) failed at the box office. For decades afterwards Disney would be the only American studio to regularly produce animated features, until [[Ralph Bakshi]] became the first to also release more than a handful features. He produced 8 theatrically released animated features aimed at adult audiences from 1972 to 1982. Sullivan-Bluth Studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with ''[[An American Tail]]'' in 1986.\n\nAlthough relatively few titles became as successful as Disney's features, other countries (further) developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature animations in a wide variety of styles, relatively often including [[stop motion]] and [[cutout animation]] techniques. Russia's [[Soyuzmultfilm]] animation studio, founded in 1936, produced 20 films (including shorts) per year on average and, despite a decline afterwards, reached 1,582 titles in 2018. Also China, Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic, Italy, France and Belgium have animation industries that more than occasionally released feature films, while Japan became a true powerhouse of animation production, with its own recognizable [[anime]] style of effective [[limited animation]].\n\n===Animation on television===\nAnimation became very popular on television since the 1950s, when television sets started to become common in most wealthy countries. Cartoons were mainly programmed for children, on convenient time slots, and especially US youth spent many hours watching [[Saturday-morning cartoon]]s. Many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s, production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to TV series. [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] was especially prolific and had huge hit series, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960-1966) (the first [[prime time]] animated series), ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' (since 1969) and Belgian co-production ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'' (1981-1989). The constraints of American television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker [[limited animation]] methods and much more formulaic scripts. Quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (since 1989) as part of a \"renaissance\" of American animation.\n\nWhile American animation also experienced international successes, many other countries produced their own child-oriented programming, often preferring [[stop-motion]] and [[puppetry]] over cel animation. Japanese [[anime]] became very successful internationally since the 1960s, and European producers looking for affordable traditional animation relatively often started co-productions with Japanese studios, with hit series such as ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (The Netherlands/Japan/France 1973-1977), ''[[Vicky the Viking|Wickie und die starken M\u00e4nner/\u5c0f\u3055\u306a\u30d0\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 \u30d3\u30c3\u30b1 (Vicky the Viking)]]'' (Austria/Germany/Japan 1974) and  ''[[Once Upon a Time...|Il \u00e9tait une fois\u2026 (Once Upon a Time...)]]'' (France/Japan 1978).\n\n===Switch from cel animation to computer animation===\n{{main|History of computer animation}}\n\n[[Computer animation]] was gradually developed since the 1940s. 3D wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s, with an early (short) appearance in the sci-fi thriller ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'' was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera.<ref name=\"first digital guinness\">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-fully-digital-feature-film/ |title=First fully digital feature film |work=Guinness World Records |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |accessdate=2018-12-27 }}</ref> It was created with the [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) developed by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in collaboration with [[Pixar]] in the late 1980s, in a style that's very similar to traditional cel animation.\n\nThe 3D style, more often associated with computer animation, has become extremely popular since Pixar's ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), the first computer animated feature in this style. \n\nMost of the traditional animation film studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s, as it proved cheaper and more profitable. Not only the very popular 3D animation style was generated with computers, but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand-crafted appearance. Most of the characteristics of traditional handmade animation that were deemed charming could be emulated with software, while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/sergio-pablos-talks-about-his-stunning-hand-drawn-project-klaus-exclusive-113621.html |title=Sergio Pablos Talks About His Stunning Hand-Drawn Project 'Klaus' |last=Amidi |first=Amid |date=1 June 2015 |website=[[Cartoon Brew]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxhr6KAaUw |title=The Origins of Klaus |date=10 October 2019 |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Abbie|title=Assignment X|url=http://www.assignmentx.com/2013/exclusive-interview-john-kahrs-kristina-reed-on-paperman/|work=Exclusive Interview: John Kahrs & Kristina Reed on PAPERMAN|publisher=Midnight Productions, Inc|accessdate=6 October 2013|date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/2/#id=I2_1340992465384&parent=http%3A%2F%2Finsidemovies.ew.com&rpctoken=342270562&_methods=onPlusOne%2Constartinteraction%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart|title=FIRST LOOK: Disney's 'Paperman' fuses hand-drawn charm with digital depth|work=EW.com|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sarto|first=Dan|title=Inside Disney's New Animated Short Paperman|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/short-films/inside-disney-s-new-animated-short-paperman|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2012/06/29/disneys-paperman-animated-short-fuses-cg-and-hand-drawn-techniques/|title=Disney's Paperman animated short fuses CG and hand-drawn techniques|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the animation market was worth US$68.4 billion.{{sfn|Board of Investments|2009}} Animated feature-length films returned the highest [[gross margin]]s (around 52%) of all [[film genre]]s between 2004 and 2013.{{sfn|McDuling|2014}} Animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early-2020s.\n\n==Education, propaganda and commercials==\nThe clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction, while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality. It has therefore been widely for other purposed than mere entertainment.\n\nDuring World War II, animation was widely exploited for propaganda. [[World War II and American animation|Many American studios]], including Warner Bros. and Disney, lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values. Some countries, including China, Japan and the United Kingdom, produced their first feature-length animation for their war efforts. \n\nAnimation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] \"[[Kills Bugs Dead]]\" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Spin-off enterprises: other media, merchandise and theme parks==\nApart from their success in movie theaters and television series, many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media.   \n\nAnimation has traditionally been very closely related to [[comic book]]s. While many comic book characters found their way to the screen, original animated characters also commonly appear in  comic books and magazines. Somewhat similarly, characters and plots for [[video game]]s (an interactive animation medium) have been derived from movies and vice versa.\n\nSome of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media. Stories and images can easily be adapted into children's books and other printed media. Songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media.\n\nWhile very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media, [[The Walt Disney Company]] is the best known and most extreme example. Since first being licensed for a children's writing tablet in 1929, their [[Mickey Mouse]] mascot has been [[Mickey_Mouse#Merchandising|depicted on an enormous amount of products]], as have many other Disney characters. This may have influenced some [[Mickey_Mouse#pejorative use of Mickey's name|pejorative use of Mickey's name]], but [[Disney Consumer Products|licensed Disney products]] sell well, and the so-called [[Disneyana]] has many avid collectors, and even a dedicated Disneyana fanclub (since 1984).\n\n[[Disneyland]] opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on Disney's cartoon characters. Its enormous success spawned several other [[Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products#Disney_resorts|Disney theme parks and resorts]]. [[The_Walt_Disney_Company#Financial_data|Disney's earnings]] from the theme parks has relatively often been higher than those from their movies.\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. With its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|Amidi|2011}} Many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|Nagel|2008}}\n\n==Awards==\n{{Main|Animation studio#American studios}}\nAs with any other form of media, animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field. The original awards for animation were presented by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[Academy Awards]] function. The first winner of the [[5th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] was the short ''Flowers and Trees'',{{sfn|Walt Disney Family Museum|2013}} a production by [[Walt Disney Productions]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|Shaffer|2010|page=211}} The Academy Award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th Academy Awards in 2002. It was won by the film ''[[Shrek]]'', produced by [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] and [[Pacific Data Images]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=84\u201385}} [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' was the first animated film nominated for Best Picture. ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' also received Best Picture nominations after the Academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten.\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]\n\nSeveral other countries have instituted an award for best-animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Animation]] (since 2008), [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006), [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2011), [[Golden Rooster Award for Best Animation]] (since 1981), [[Goya Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 1989), [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]] (since 2007), [[National Film Award for Best Animated Film]] (since 2006). Also since 2007, the [[Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Animated Feature Film]] has been awarded at the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]]. Since 2009, the [[European Film Awards]] have awarded the [[European Film Award for Best Animated Film]].\n\nThe [[Annie Award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. Unlike the Academy Awards, the Annie Awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. They were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for Best Animated Feature. The 1990s winners were dominated by Walt Disney, however, newer studios, led by Pixar & DreamWorks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. The list of awardees is as follows:\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production]]\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Joy &amp; Heron - Animated CGI Spot by Passion Pictures.webm|thumb|Joy &amp; Heron - A featured video]]\nThe creation of non-trivial animation works (i.e., longer than a few seconds) has developed as a form of [[filmmaking]], with certain unique aspects.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=117}} Traits common to both live-action and animated [[Feature film|feature-length films]] are labor-intensity and high production costs.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=274}}\n\nThe most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|White|2006|p=151}} It is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=339}} It is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=55}} Thus, animation studios starting with Disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole. {{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=120}} While live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nAnother problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a film's consistency from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger. Animators, like all artists, necessarily have individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film.{{sfn|Masson|2007|p=94}} Since the early 1980s, teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators, typically have created feature-length animated films. It is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult.{{sfn|Beck|2004|p=37}}\n\nThis problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins. Character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=146}} On traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}}{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}}\n\nUnlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=99\u2013100}} In the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n=== Traditional animation ===\n{{Main|Traditional animation}}\n\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|An example of traditional animation, a horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos]]\n\n'''Traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|White|2006|p=31}} The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=153}} To create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|Thomas|Johnston|1981|pp=277\u201379}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|p=203}} The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture film.{{sfn|White|2006|pp=195\u2013201}}\n\nThe traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century. Today, animators' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system.{{sfn|Buchan|2013}}{{sfn|White|2006|p=394}} Various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects.{{sfn|Culhane|1990|p=296}} The final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media, including traditional [[35mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] and newer media with [[digital video]].{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=35\u201336, 52\u201353}}{{sfn|Buchan|2013}} The \"look\" of traditional cel animation is still preserved, and the [[character animator]]s' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years.{{sfn|Williams|2001|pp=52\u201357}} Some animation producers have used the term \"tradigital\" (a play on the words \"traditional\" and \"digital\") to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology.\n\nExamples of traditionally animated feature films include ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (United States, 1940),{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=63\u201365}} ''[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|Animal Farm]]'' (United Kingdom, 1954), ''[[Lucky and Zorba]]'' (Italy, 1998), and ''[[The Illusionist (2010 film)|The Illusionist]]'' (British-French, 2010).

Fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n==== Limited animation ====\n\n{{Main|Limited animation}}\n\n'''[[Limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or \"skippy\" movement animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=142}} Limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. This is a more economic technique. Pioneered by the artists at the American studio [[United Productions of America]],{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=54\u201355}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing]]'' (US, 1951), ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' (UK, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in Japan.{{sfn|Ledoux|1997|p=24, 29}} Its primary use, however, has been in producing cost-effective animated content for media for television (the work of Hanna-Barbera,{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=82}} [[Filmation]],{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=241}} and other TV animation studios{{sfn|Lawson|Persons|2004|p=xxi}}) and later [[the Internet]] ([[web cartoon]]s).\n\n==== Rotoscoping ====\n\n{{Main|Rotoscoping}}\n\n'''Rotoscoping''' is a technique patented by [[Max Fleischer]] in 1917 where animators trace live-action movement, frame by frame.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=158}} The source film can be directly copied from actors' outlines into animated drawings,{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=163\u201364}} as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (US, 1978), or used in a stylized and expressive manner, as in ''[[Waking Life]]'' (US, 2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (US, 2006). Some other examples are ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' (US, 1983), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), and ''[[The Flowers of Evil (manga)|Aku no Hana]]'' (2013).\n\n==== Live-action/animation ====\n\n{{Main|Films with live action and animation}}\n\n'''[[Films with live action and animation|Live-action/animation]]''' is a technique combining hand-drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots.{{sfn|Laybourne|1998|pp=162\u201363}} One of the earlier uses was in [[Koko the Clown]] when Koko was drawn over live action footage.{{sfn|Beck|2004|pp=18\u201319}}.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letter forms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound.

In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

She is a bit of a [[tomboy]]&mdash;acting as captain of the [[dinghy]], ''Amazon'' and usually directing her friends in their various adventures.  Nancy apparently has no real-world counterpart as an inspirational source for Ransome but appears to be completely the author's creation.  Nancy is sometimes critically viewed as a subversive character for girl readers.  The character appeared in a 1963 BBC television adaptation of ''[[Swallows and Amazons (TV series)|Swallows and Amazons]]'' as well as in the [[Swallows and Amazons (1974 film)|1974]] and [[Swallows and Amazons (2016 film)|2016]] film adaptations of the book.\n\n==Role in the series==\nAt the opening of the series in ''Swallows and Amazons, '' Nancy is 12 years old and lives with her younger sister Peggy and her widowed mother in a large [[Lake District|Lakeland]] house called Beckfoot. In common with his treatment of many of his other characters, Ransome does not give a detailed description of Nancy, merely describing her as \"bigger than John\" (Walker). She is something of a [[tomboy]] who captains a dinghy called ''Amazon'', usually wears a red pirate cap and often uses nautical or piratical words in her speech, such as \"Jibbooms and bobstays\" or the classic \"shiver my timbers.\" In her first appearance in ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]'', Peggy reveals that \"Nancy\" is itself a nickname derived from her affection for pirates: her real name is Ruth, which she changed to Nancy after her Uncle Jim pointed out that pirates are \"ruthless.\" Nancy is the elder of the ''Amazons'' and older than the ''Swallows''. She usually takes the lead in their adventures. Nancy has a lively imagination and usually thinks up adventures for her friends which she makes more exciting by imagining an exotic background such as climbing [[List of places in Arthur Ransome books#By the Lake|Kanchenjunga]] in ''[[Swallowdale]]'' instead of just a local mountain. Nancy is still a prime mover of the action even when she is prevented from taking direct part in the action such as when she is quarantined with [[mumps]] in ''[[Winter Holiday]]'', or when she and Peggy are kept at home when the Great Aunt comes to stay in ''[[The Picts and the Martyrs]]''.\n\n==Character summary==\n[[File:Nancy Blackett (Nancy).jpg|thumb|\"''Nancy takes charge - loading Captain Flint''\"  Detail of an illustration by  [[Arthur Ransome]] from ''[[Swallowdale]]'' showing Nancy as visualised by her creator]]\n\nHer upbringing in a [[Single parent|single-parent]] household with only intermittent male influence of her uncle has been suggested as a contributing factor towards her independence and sturdy self-reliance.<ref>Thompson, p. 16</ref>\nUnlike [[List of characters in Arthur Ransome books#The Swallows|John Walker]], the Captain of ''Swallow'', who defers to his father's judgements and seeks approval before acting, Nancy makes and acts on decisions for herself.

G. Collingwood|William Collingwood]], whom Ransome first met on [[Peel Island, Cumbria|Peel Island]] in 1896, and Taqui Altounyan, daughter of Dora Collingwood and the oldest of the Altounyan children who were models for the [[List of characters in Arthur Ransome books#The Swallows|Swallows]].<ref>Hardyment, p. 40</ref> Ransome himself was never explicit about the inspiration for Nancy, saying only that he had once seen two small girls in red caps playing on the shore of [[Coniston Water]] near his house.<ref>Wardale, p. 21</ref> Another suggestion is that she was based on Georgina Rawdon Smith, whose father had been at [[Rugby School|Rugby]] with Ransome, and who, with her sister Pauline, met and played with the Altounyan children on the shores of [[Coniston Water|Coniston]].<ref>Marshall, p. 5</ref>\n\nRansome's own relationship with Nancy was complex. He recognised that her character defined and led the plots but also acknowledged that other characters were dominated and diminished by her presence. Discussing the plot of ''[[Winter Holiday (novel)|Winter Holiday]]'' in a letter to his mother dated 2 March 1929 he wrote \"the main point of the new book is that two other children turn up... ...and then get involved in one of Captain Nancy's colossal plans for adventure\" but later in the same paragraph he mentions the more prominent role that Peggy will play \"who in previous books has never really had a fair chance, being so much dominated by Nancy\".<ref>Brogan, p. 331</ref>\n\n==Critical commentary==\nWhen Ransome was first writing ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]'' in 1928, it was unusual for a female character to display such active leadership over males as Nancy Blackett does in the whole series of books and whilst children in children's literature had become increasingly self-motivated towards the end of the 19th century, they were, until Swallows and Amazons, still largely bounded by a \"closed nursery-orientated world\".<ref>Hunt, p. 161</ref>  In ''[[Secret Water]]'', Daisy the leader of the \"Eels\" is their leader, although younger than her brothers Dum and Dee.\n\nNevertheless, despite writing Nancy in an unconventional role, [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] suggests that Ransome can still be accused of sexism as Susan Walker's domesticity reinforces the common views of the time; however, he points out that gender is unimportant in Ransome's work.<ref>Hunt, p. 165</ref>\n\nDespite ageing from about twelve to fifteen over the series Nancy, in common with all the children in Ransome's books, shows no sign of developing any interest in sex; in this Ransome is merely reflecting the historical and cultural context of the time, as \"Children's fiction in the 1930s had found no way of writing about sex.\"<ref name= Watson69>Watson, p. 69</ref> Victor Watson, a critic of children's fiction, proposes that Nancy's principal role in the books is to open up \"possibilities\" and \"disrupt the comfortable certainties of the Walker family\".<ref name=\"Watson69\" /> He observes that she is a force of goodness, especially in the way she deals with her adult counterpart, the Great Aunt, in ''[[The Picts and the Martyrs]]''. Nancy shares many characteristics with the Great Aunt, but she displays a \"heroic generosity\" which the Great Aunt does not have, and does not share the adult's innate cruelty.<ref>Watson, p. 65</ref>\n\nIn 1960, a possible path for Nancy's adult life was proposed when critic Hugh Shelley postulated that she might have found the [[Second World War]] liberating and become a [[Wren (Royal Navy)|WREN]].  He suggested that \"as a character one feels she could not be transmuted into a normal, satisfactory adult\".<ref>Shelley, p. 19</ref> Recent analysis of Shelley's work by Katherine Holden has concluded the suggestion is a veiled reference to [[lesbianism]] and this, as well as his idea that Nancy would have eventually grown to be like her spinster Great Aunt Maria, has been dismissed as reflecting the [[homophobia]] of the time when Shelley was writing.<ref>Holden, p. 170</ref> Today, Nancy is viewed as a subversive figure who, in the context of [[Interwar period|interwar]] Britain, offered young girls the possibility of an alternative route to adulthood.<ref>Holden, p. 171</ref> The character has been cited by [[feminist]] author and academic [[Sara Maitland]] as a childhood role model \"who transcended the restriction of femininity without succumbing to the lure of male-identification\" and a \"hero who had all the characteristics necessary for the job; who lived between the countries of the material and the imaginary\".<ref>Wardale p. 20</ref>\n\n==Film and television==\nNancy Blackett has been portrayed in television and film.

The film is about a middle-aged male professor, Humbert, who rents a room in the house of the widow Charlotte Haze and becomes sexually attracted to her [[adolescent]] daughter Dolores, also called \"Lo\" or \"Lolita\".\n\nLyne's film is more overt with many of the novel's darker elements compared to [[Lolita (1962 film)|Stanley Kubrick's 1962 version]], which used suggestion and innuendo for comic purposes.\n\nThe film had difficulty finding an American distributor<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | title = 'Lolita': Revisiting a Dangerous Obsession | first = Caryn | last = James | url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/tv-lolita-review.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1998-07-31 | accessdate = 2010-03-28 }}</ref> and premiered in Europe before being released in the United States.

He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze ([[Melanie Griffith]]), largely because he is romantically attracted to her 12-year-old daughter Dolores ([[Dominique Swain]]), also called \"Lo\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \"[[Lolita (term)#Nymphet|nymphet]]s\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and marries Charlotte only to be near her daughter.\n\nCharlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \"[[Lolita (term)|Lolita]]\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various [[Motor inn|motels]] before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending Beardsley Prep School an [[Single-sex education|all-girls]] [[Catholic school|Catholic school]]. Humbert and Lo must conceal the nature of their relationship from everyone- strangers they encounter when traveling as well as the administration at Beardsley. They present themselves to the world as a father and daughter. Over time, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty ([[Frank Langella]]), who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name.\n\nThree years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Her husband, Richard, knows nothing about her past. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually [[Stalking|tracked]] young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for [[child pornography]]. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.\n\nAfter his visit with Lo, Humbert tracks down Quilty and murders him. After being chased by the police, Humbert is arrested and sent to prison. He dies in prison on November 1950 due to a [[coronary thrombosis]], and Lo dies the next month on Christmas Day from childbirth complications.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Professor Humbert Humbert\n** [[Ben Silverstone]] as young Humbert\n* [[Dominique Swain]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Clare Quilty\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Charlotte Haze\n* [[Suzanne Shepherd]] as Miss Pratt\n* [[Keith Reddin]] as Reverend Rigger\n* [[Erin J.

Harris|James Harris]] and was directed by Kubrick.\n\nThe screenplay for the 1997 version, more faithful to the text of the novel than the earlier motion picture, is credited to [[Stephen Schiff]], a writer for ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and other magazines. Schiff was hired to write it as his first movie script, after the film's producers had rejected commissioned screenplays from the more experienced screenwriters and directors [[James Dearden]] (''[[Fatal Attraction]]''), [[Harold Pinter]], and [[David Mamet]].<ref name = Gale>According to Gale, in ''Sharp Cut'', Pinter was paid for his work but he asked to have his name removed from the credits, as permitted by his contract.: \"In November 1994 Pinter wrote that 'I've just heard that they are bringing another writer into the ''Lolita'' film. It doesn't surprise me.' Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (this was also the case with [the film] ''[[The Remains of the Day]]''\u2014he had insisted on this clause since the experience with revisions made to his ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|Handmaid's Tale]]'' script\" (352).</ref><ref name = Hudgins>Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which he has decided not to publish. When his script for ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)#Background and production notes|Remains of the Day]]'' was radically revised by the [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]]\u2013[[Ismail Merchant]] partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\"; Hudgins adds: \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's ''Lolita'' finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 [1995] letter [to Hudgins] to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the ''Remains of the Day'' situation. He concludes that though he never met Nabokov, 'indeed I knew \"Lolita\" very well and loved it.'&nbsp;\" (125). Hudgins also observes that Schiff was brought in after the efforts by Dearden (October 21, 1991), Pinter (September 26, 1994), and Mamet (March 10, 1995) and that Schiff \"has no previous scripts to his credit\" (124).</ref><ref>In his 2008 essay published in ''The Pinter Review'', Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed filmscripts, ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'', and ''Lolita'',\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful filmscripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter filmscripts are now available not only in private collections but also in the [[The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library|Pinter Archive at the British Library]]\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished filmscripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).</ref> According to Schiff:\n\n{{quote|Right from the beginning, it was clear to all of us that this movie was not a \"remake\" of Kubrick's film. Rather, we were out to make a new adaptation of a very great novel. Some of the filmmakers involved actually looked upon the Kubrick version as a kind of \"what not to do.\" I had somewhat fonder memories of it than that, but I had not seen it for maybe fifteen years, and I didn't allow myself to go back to it again.<ref name=hye>\"[https://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/schiff1.htm An Interview with Stephen Schiff]\" by Suellen Stringer-Hye, [[Penn State University]] Libraries, 1996</ref>}}\nSchiff added that Kubrick's film might better have been titled ''Quilty'', since the director had \nallowed the character of Quilty to \"take over the movie\".<ref>Schiff : \"Kubrick...made a film that might better have been titled Quilty. Very much in the thrall of [[Peter Sellers]], he allowed Quilty to take over the movie, with Sellers improvising vast swatches of dialogue. If you look at the Kubrick movie today, the Sellers stuff still seems amazingly energetic and funny and alive; the rest of the story plods by comparison. The other strange choice in the Kubrick film, of course, is [[Sue Lyon]], who, even though she was only fifteen when she played Lolita--the same age as our Dominique Swain--could easily have passed for a twenty-year-old [[porno star]]. Dominique can easily pass for a twelve-year-old, which we all think is a very good thing.\" From the Schiff interview by Suellen Stringer-Hye, 1996</ref>\n\nLyne states in the DVD commentary that he prefers location shooting even though it is more difficult in some respects; and that the home of Charlotte Haze was filmed in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].\n\n==Release==\n''Lolita'' premiered in the United States on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on August 2, 1998.

He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze ([[Melanie Griffith]]), largely because he is romantically attracted to her 12-year-old daughter Dolores ([[Dominique Swain]]), also called \"Lo\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \"[[Lolita (term)#Nymphet|nymphet]]s\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter.\n\nCharlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed. Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \"[[Lolita (term)|Lolita]]\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various [[Motor inn|motels]] before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending Beardsley Prep School an [[Single-sex education|all-girls]] [[Catholic school|Catholic school]]. Humbert and Lo must conceal the nature of their relationship from everyone- strangers they encounter when traveling as well as the administration at Beardsley. They present themselves to the world as a father and daughter. Over time, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty ([[Frank Langella]]), who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name.\n\nThree years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Her husband, Richard, knows nothing about her past. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually [[Stalking|tracked]] young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for [[child pornography]]. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films.\n\nAfter his visit with Lo, Humbert tracks down Quilty and murders him. After being chased by the police, Humbert is arrested and sent to prison. He dies in prison on November 1950 due to a [[coronary thrombosis]], and Lo dies the next month on Christmas Day from childbirth complications.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as Professor Humbert Humbert\n** [[Ben Silverstone]] as young Humbert\n* [[Dominique Swain]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Frank Langella]] as Clare Quilty\n* [[Melanie Griffith]] as Charlotte Haze\n* [[Suzanne Shepherd]] as Miss Pratt\n* [[Keith Reddin]] as Reverend Rigger\n* [[Erin J.

Harris|James Harris]] and was directed by Kubrick.\n\nThe screenplay for the 1997 version, more faithful to the text of the novel than the earlier motion picture, is credited to [[Stephen Schiff]], a writer for ''[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', and other magazines. Schiff was hired to write it as his first movie script, after the film's producers had rejected commissioned screenplays from the more experienced screenwriters and directors [[James Dearden]] (''[[Fatal Attraction]]''), [[Harold Pinter]], and [[David Mamet]].<ref name = Gale>According to Gale, in ''Sharp Cut'', Pinter was paid for his work but he asked to have his name removed from the credits, as permitted by his contract.: \"In November 1994 Pinter wrote that 'I've just heard that they are bringing another writer into the ''Lolita'' film. It doesn't surprise me.' Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (this was also the case with [the film] ''[[The Remains of the Day]]''\u2014he had insisted on this clause since the experience with revisions made to his ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|Handmaid's Tale]]'' script\" (352).</ref><ref name = Hudgins>Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which he has decided not to publish. When his script for ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)#Background and production notes|Remains of the Day]]'' was radically revised by the [[James Ivory (director)|James Ivory]]\u2013[[Ismail Merchant]] partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\"; Hudgins adds: \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's ''Lolita'' finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 [1995] letter [to Hudgins] to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the ''Remains of the Day'' situation. He concludes that though he never met Nabokov, 'indeed I knew \"Lolita\" very well and loved it.'&nbsp;\" (125). Hudgins also observes that Schiff was brought in after the efforts by Dearden (October 21, 1991), Pinter (September 26, 1994), and Mamet (March 10, 1995) and that Schiff \"has no previous scripts to his credit\" (124).</ref><ref>In his 2008 essay published in ''The Pinter Review'', Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed filmscripts, ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'', and ''Lolita'',\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful filmscripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter filmscripts are now available not only in private collections but also in the [[The Harold Pinter Archive in the British Library|Pinter Archive at the British Library]]\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished filmscripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).</ref> According to Schiff:\n\n{{quote|Right from the beginning, it was clear to all of us that this movie was not a \"remake\" of Kubrick's film. Rather, we were out to make a new adaptation of a very great novel. Some of the filmmakers involved actually looked upon the Kubrick version as a kind of \"what not to do.\" I had somewhat fonder memories of it than that, but I had not seen it for maybe fifteen years, and I didn't allow myself to go back to it again.<ref name=hye>\"[https://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/schiff1.htm An Interview with Stephen Schiff]\" by Suellen Stringer-Hye, [[Penn State University]] Libraries, 1996</ref>}}\nSchiff added that Kubrick's film might better have been titled ''Quilty'', since the director had \nallowed the character of Quilty to \"take over the movie\".<ref>Schiff : \"Kubrick...made a film that might better have been titled Quilty. Very much in the thrall of [[Peter Sellers]], he allowed Quilty to take over the movie, with Sellers improvising vast swatches of dialogue. If you look at the Kubrick movie today, the Sellers stuff still seems amazingly energetic and funny and alive; the rest of the story plods by comparison. The other strange choice in the Kubrick film, of course, is [[Sue Lyon]], who, even though she was only fifteen when she played Lolita--the same age as our Dominique Swain--could easily have passed for a twenty-year-old [[porno star]]. Dominique can easily pass for a twelve-year-old, which we all think is a very good thing.\" From the Schiff interview by Suellen Stringer-Hye, 1996</ref>\n\nLyne states in the DVD commentary that he prefers location shooting even though it is more difficult in some respects; and that the home of Charlotte Haze was filmed in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].\n\n==Release==\n''Lolita'' premiered in the United States on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on August 2, 1998. Due to the difficulty in securing a distributor, the film received a [[Limited release|limited theatrical run]] in the US on September 25, 1998, in order to qualify for awards.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Accordingly, the film took in a gross income of $19,492 in its opening weekend.

Hitler was so rattled by the experience that, years later, he would not allow Litten's name to be mentioned in his presence. In retaliation, Litten was arrested on the night of the [[Reichstag fire]] along with other [[progressivism|progressive]] lawyers and [[leftist]]s. Litten spent the rest of his life in one [[German concentration camp]] or another, enduring torture and many interrogations. After five years and a move to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], where his treatment worsened and he was cut off from all outside communication, he committed suicide.\n\nA number of memorials to him exist in Germany, but Litten was largely ignored for decades because his politics did not fit comfortably in either the west or the communist postwar propaganda. Not until 2011 was Litten finally portrayed in the mass media, when the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[The Man Who Crossed Hitler]]'', a television film set in Berlin in summer 1931.\n\n== Biographical details ==\n\n=== The early years ===\nLitten was born the eldest of three sons in a wealthy family in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]].

He opposed the postwar [[Weimar Republic]]. A distinguished [[jurist]] and professor of [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], he was [[Dean (education)|dean]] of [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]]'s law school, later becoming [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of that institution.<ref name=\"cord\" /> He was also privy counsel (''Geheimer Justizrat'') and adviser to the Prussian government. Irmgard was from an established Lutheran family in [[Swabia]], the daughter of Albert W\u00fcst, a professor at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]]. The family left Halle in 1906 and moved to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in [[Prussia]].\n\nLitten himself was [[baptism|baptized]] a Christian, but as a youngster learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], choosing it as one of the subjects for his ''[[Abitur]]'' examinations. From his mother, Litten acquired an interest in [[Humanism|humanitarian ideas]] and art, and gained a strong sense of [[justice]] for the threatened, persecuted and disenfranchised. While his father was away at war, Litten once took food from the kitchen to give to a beggar, addressing him as \"sir\".<ref name=\"momfights\">Irmgard Litten, ''Eine Mutter k\u00e4mpft gegen Hitler'', Deutscher Anwaltverlag, Bonn (2000) pp. 18, 40, 80-81, 173, 271 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Litten's relationship with his father was strained,<ref name=\"gerd\">Gerhard Jungfer, [http://www.brak-mitteilungen.de/media/brakmitt_2003_04.pdf \"Hans Litten zum 100.

He was shaped by important political and social events of the era, such as World War I,<ref name=\"cord\" /> the anti-war demonstration in Berlin on 1 May 1916, when Litten was not quite 13, the [[German Revolution]] of 1918\u20131919, and the arrest and murder of [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] by [[Freikorps]] soldiers in January 1919. There is an anecdote from Litten's school years, when he was asked in the classroom if they should hang a picture of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], victor of the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|1914 Battle of Tannenberg]]. Litten stated, \"I've always been in favour of hanging him.\"<ref name=\"Hett 2008 ?\">{{Harvnb|Hett|2008|p={{page needed|date=December 2013}}}}.</ref>\n\nLitten was pressed into studying law by his father.

The [[Kapp Putsch]], the [[Beer Hall Putsch#Trial and prison|1924 court case]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] and other events convinced Litten that Germany was approaching a very dangerous period. His perception that right-wing radicals were receiving more lenient treatment in court than their opponents led to his decision to become a lawyer.<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nLitten passed his examinations in 1927 with excellent grades and was offered a lucrative job in the [[Reich Ministry of Justice]], as well as a good position in a flourishing law firm. He declined both choosing instead to open a law office in 1928 with Dr. Ludwig Barbasch, a friend who was close to the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]].<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nPolitically Litten was on the left, though independent. He valued his independence and once said, \"two people would be one too many for my party.\"<ref name=\"cord\" /><ref name=\"review\" /> Culturally, Litten was conservative, enjoying [[classical music]] and poetry such as that of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], whose work he could recite. He was an internationalist and was able to read English, Italian, and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] and enjoyed the music of the Middle East. He had a photographic memory and was considered to have a brilliant intellect.\n\n=== Cross-examination of Hitler ===\nIn May 1931, Litten summoned [[Adolf Hitler]] to testify in the [[#1931: Tanzpalast Eden Trial|Tanzpalast Eden Trial]], a court case involving two workers stabbed by four [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men. Litten cross examined Hitler for three hours, finding many points of contradiction and proving that Hitler had exhorted the SA to embark on a systematic campaign of violence against the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]' enemies. This was crucial because Hitler was meanwhile trying to pose as a conventional politician to middle class voters and maintained that the [[Nazi Party]] was \"strictly legal\". Though a judge halted Litten's questioning, thus saving Hitler from further damning exposure, newspapers at the time reported on the trial in detail and Hitler was investigated for perjury that summer. He survived the investigation intact, but was rattled by the experience.<ref name=\"review\" /><ref>Benjamin Carter Hett, \"Hans Litten and the Politics of Criminal Law in the Weimar Republic\", in Markus Dirk Dubber and Lindsay Farmer, eds., ''Modern Histories of Crime and Punishment'', Stanford University Press (2007)</ref><ref name=\"Hett 2008 65ff\">{{Harvnb|Hett|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-WRKn8OyVMC&pg=PA58 65 ff.]}}</ref>\n\n=== The Nazis seize power ===\nBy 1932, the [[July 1932 German federal election|Nazi party was in ascendancy]].

Litten was sent to [[Sonnenburg concentration camp]], [[Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden Prison]], where he was tortured, along with anarchist [[Erich M\u00fchsam]]. In February 1934, he was moved to the ''Moorlager'', [[Esterwegen]] concentration camp in [[Emsland]] and a few months later, he was sent to [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|Lichtenburg]].<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nThe treatment Litten suffered was later described to his mother by an eyewitness. Very early on, he was beaten so badly that the Nazis refused to let even his fellow prisoners see him.<ref name=\"momfights\" /> He was tortured and forced into hard labor. He attempted suicide in 1933 in an attempt to avoid endangering his former clients, but he was revived by the Nazis so that they could interrogate him further. Litten's suicide attempt came at [[Spandau Prison]], after he buckled under torture administered to extract information about the Felsenecke trial (see below). After revealing some information, he was immediately accused in the press as an accomplice to the murder of an SA man. Litten then wrote a letter to the [[Gestapo]], saying that evidence gained in such a manner was not true and that he recanted. Knowing what awaited him, he then attempted to take his life.<ref name=\"cord\" /><ref name=\"review\" /><ref name=\"gerd\" />\n\nLitten's mother wrote about his ordeal, recounting how injuries sustained by him early on left his health permanently damaged. One eye and one leg were injured, never recovering; his jawbone fractured; inner ear damaged; and many teeth knocked out. She also related how, despite her access to many important people in Germany at that time, including [[Ministry of the Reichswehr|Reichswehrminister]] [[Werner von Blomberg]], Prince [[Wilhelm of Prussia]], [[Protestant Reich Church|Reichsbischof]] [[Ludwig M\u00fcller (theologian)|Ludwig M\u00fcller]], Minister of Justice [[Franz G\u00fcrtner]] and even then-State Secretary [[Roland Freisler]], she was unable to secure her son's release.<ref name=\"momfights\" /><ref>Edith H.

Retrieved June 4, 2010</ref>\n\nDespite his injuries and suffering, Litten strove to maintain his spirits. At one point, in 1934, his situation improved a little bit when he was moved to Lichtenburg. Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then he was allowed to work in the book bindery and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage.<ref name=\"cord\" /> One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance. Unafraid of their presence, Litten recited the lyrics of a song that had meant a lot to him in his youth, \"Thoughts are free\" (in German, ''[[Die Gedanken sind frei]]''). The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words.<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\n=== Dachau and death ===\nIn summer 1937, Litten was sent to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] for a month, before finally being sent to Dachau. He arrived on 16 October  1937 and was put in the Jewish barracks. The Jewish prisoners were isolated from others because Jews in other countries were then spreading the grim news about Dachau. Litten's last letter to his family, written in November 1937, spoke of the situation, adding that the Jewish prisoners were soon to be denied mail privileges until further notice. All letters from Jewish prisoners at Dachau ceased at this time.<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\nIn the face of their depressing situation, the Jews at Dachau made efforts to have culture and discussion in their lives, to keep their spirits up. Litten would recite [[Rilke]] for hours and he impressed the other prisoners with his knowledge on many subjects. Underneath, however, Litten was losing hope.<ref name=\"cord\" /> On 5 February 1938, after five years of interrogation and torture<ref name=\"ccr\" />{{failed verification<!--death date not shown-->|date=February 2018}} and a failed escape attempt, Litten was found by several friends from his barracks, hanging in the lavatory, a suicide.<ref name=\"knut292\">Knut Bergbauer, Sabine Fr\u00f6hlich and Stephanie Sch\u00fcler-Springorum, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sh7RWIUUfdcC&pg=PA292&lpg=PA292&dq=litten+%22Alfred+Gr\u00fcnebaum%22&source=bl&ots=QaV6UQRcq6&sig=OZRElbym830KepZ3NtpyjjWetEg&hl=en&ei=pwoQTJhm48Y4zqiNhgE&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=litten%20%22Alfred%20Gr\u00fcnebaum%22&f=false ''Denkmalsfigur.

He showed it to the [[Prisoner functionary#Ranks of functionary|block\u00e4lteste]], who said it wasn't the first that had been found in Litten's possession. At the time, Litten was under interrogation in the \"bunker\" (see photo). When he came back, he was clearly in a suicidal frame of mind, repeating several times that he \"must speak with Heinz Eschen\", a prisoner who had just died. He also had recently told his friends that he'd had enough of being imprisoned. Another of Litten's Dachau friends, Alfred Gr\u00fcnebaum, said later that Litten was in constant fear of more brutal interrogations and that Litten had given up on ever being free. On the evening of 4 February 1938, it was clear what Litten had in mind, but no one kept watch. In the middle of the night, his bed was discovered empty and his friends found him hanging in the lavatory. Litten wrote a few parting words and that he had decided to take his life.<ref name=\"knut292\" />\n\n== Highlights of Litten's legal work ==\nRight away, during one of his first trials, Litten caused a sensation, setting the stage for his future as a \"labor lawyer\". He represented workers who were sentenced in March 1921 to a long term at hard labor in a ''[[Prisons in Germany#Law|Zuchthaus]]'' for organized resistance against a police raid of a [[Ruhr Uprising|mass uprising in the central German industrial region]] a year earlier. The police raid was ordered by the Prussian Minister of the Interior, [[Carl Severing]].<ref>Ludger Grevelh\u00f6rster, [http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=39&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente \"Kapp-Putsch und Ruhraufstand 1920\"] ''Geschichte Westfalens in der Weimarer Republik'', Internet Portal \u2013 Westphalian History (Internet-Portal \"Westf\u00e4lische Geschichte\") Retrieved June 3, 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Litten was able to get some of the workers recognized as political actors, making them eligible under the [[amnesty]] law of August 1920.\n\nThrough his law partner, Barbasch, Litten got involved with the ''[[Rote Hilfe]]'', a solidarity organization founded by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Clara Zetkin]] that supported worker's families in dire need during the [[Weimar Republic#Years of crisis (1919\u20131923)|turbulent early years]] of the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>[http://www.uni-protokolle.de/Lexikon/Rote_Hilfe.html \"Rote Hilfe\"] Retrieved June 3, 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> In addition, the ''Rote Hilfe'' arranged legal support and [[Criminal defense lawyer|legal defense]] for workers who were under [[indictment]] for their political activities or views. By mid 1929, the ''Rote Hilfe'' had helped nearly 16,000 arrested workers with legal defense and supported the legal rights of another 27,000 cases.\n\n=== 1929: May Day Trial ===\nIn 1929, Litten defended participants in the 1929 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] rally in Berlin, known as [[Blutmai]] (\"Bloody May 1929\"). Annual workers' rallies on 1 May had been taking place since 1889. In 1929, however, the rally turned bloody when the police intervened with excessive force.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\">{{Harvnb|Hett|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-WRKn8OyVMC&pg=PA58 58]}}.</ref> Confrontations between demonstrators and police erupted and the police began firing into crowds and buildings, killing 33 and injuring hundreds, including many bystanders. The workers were charged with severe [[breach of the peace]] and with [[sedition]].\n\nIn preparation for a defense, Litten founded a committee with [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Carl von Ossietzky]] to investigate the event. Litten himself had been at the demonstration and observed the brutal actions of the police. When he went to one man's aid and began writing down the names of victims and eyewitnesses, he was himself beaten by a policeman, even though he had identified himself as a lawyer. Litten filed an indictment against the Berlin police president, {{ill|Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6rgiebel|de}}, for 33 counts of incitement to commit murder.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> In his legal notice, he stated:\n\n{{cquote|Z\u00f6rgiebel has been a member of the Social Democratic Party for many years. He therefore knows that even in [[Imperial Germany]] and [[czarist Russia]], workers have never foregone the right to May Day demonstrations because of a police ban. He also knows that a socialist-educated working class will never let this right be taken away. If the defendant still upheld the ban on demonstrations, he also knew there would still be a demonstration. As a person of normal intelligence, the defendant knew that lifting the ban on demonstration would not have come even close to the terrible effect from violent enforcement of the ban.}}\n\nLitten's approach was to focus on the legality of the police actions. Rather than pursue individual police officers, he sought to hold the authority, the police chief, to account and he held that Z\u00f6rgiebel had ordered the police to use [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]] and live ammunition against the demonstrators. If the police action was illegal under the [[criminal code]], the resulting deaths were then murders and anything done by the demonstrators to resist was \"self-defense in the full legal sense\".<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> He argued that Z\u00f6rgiebel had ordered the police invasion for political, rather than policing considerations. As proof, he produced a 2 May 1929 article from the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', where Z\u00f6rgiebel had written a defense of his actions that showed its political basis. According to Prussian law, police could use \"necessary measures\" to maintain public peace and security or prevent a public danger; in other words, it was to be police work and not the result of political conditions.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" />\n\n[[File:Berlin, Littenstrasse , Hans-Litten-Haus 007.jpg|thumb|right|Hans Litten Haus on Littenstra\u00dfe in Berlin]]\nThe indictment of Z\u00f6rgiebel was rejected by the state prosecutors and Litten appealed.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> Z\u00f6rgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Z\u00f6rgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence on the grounds that the 33-count murder indictment against Z\u00f6rgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Z\u00f6rgiebel on the ear.\nThe objective in Litten's many lawsuits for the victims of the police attacks and raids was not to litigate individual incidents, but rather to warn about the growing fascism in the country. He worked to put Nazi terror on display, in the hopes it would awaken the public to the threat facing them.<ref name=\"cord\" /> He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever they were, even in the highest political circles. He wasn't interested in creating socialist [[martyr]]s, rather he sought [[acquittal]] or an appropriate punishment, which caused him some conflicts with the Rote Hilfe and the KPD.\n\n=== 1931: Tanzpalast Eden Trial ===\nOn November 22, 1930, an [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] [[Rollkommando]] attacked a popular dance hall frequented predominantly by left-wing workers. The victims were members of a migrant workers' association that was holding a meeting at the Tanzpalast Eden (\"Eden Dance Palace\") in Berlin. Three people were killed and 20 injured in an attack that was planned in advance. The subsequent police investigation was plodding and slow.\n\nLitten used four of the injured to represent the [[plaintiff]], seeking to prove three cases of attempted [[manslaughter]], breach of the peace and [[assault]]. In addition to pursuing criminal convictions of the offenders, Litten wanted to show that the Nazis intentionally used terror as a tactic to destroy the democratic structures of the Weimar Republic. Hitler was summoned to appear as a witness in court to that end.\n\nShortly before, in September 1930, Hitler had appeared in [[Leipzig]] as a witness at the \"Ulm [[Reichswehr]] Trial\" against two officers charged with conspiracy to commit [[treason]] for having had membership in the [[Nazi Party]], at that time, forbidden to Reichswehr personnel.<ref name=\"cord\" /><ref name=\"wheeler\">John Wheeler-Bennett, ''The Nemesis of Power'', pp. 218-219. (1967) Macmillan, London</ref> Hitler had insisted that his party operated legally, that the phrase \"National Revolution\"<ref group=Note>In Germany, the term \"National Revolution\" is not just a reference to the French [[R\u00e9volution nationale]], but rather a term that describes the ideology and forces embraced by the [[Vichy government]], the efforts of European right-wing extremists to transform a civil-parliamentarian society into an anti-democratic, nationalist authoritarian one.</ref> was to be interpreted only \"politically\", and that his Party was a friend, not an enemy of the Reichswehr.<ref name=\"wheeler\" /> Under oath, Hitler had described the SA as an organization of \"intellectual enlightenment\" and explained his statement that \"heads will roll\" as a comment about \"intellectual revolution\".<ref group=Note>After the [[Machtergreifung]], however, Hitler elaborated further, saying \"there will be a German State Court and the [[German Revolution|November 1918]] [Revolution] will find atonement and heads will roll\".</ref>\n\nThe court called Hitler to appear on the witness stand on 8 May 1931. Litten set out to show that the SA ''Sturm 33'' (\"Storm 33\") was a ''rollkommando'' (a small, mobile paramilitary unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership.<ref name=\"cord\" /> This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts to be seen as a serious politician and statesman.\n\nHitler never forgot the Eden trial, and held a personal antipathy towards Litten.<ref name=\"cord\" /> Years later, Litten's name still could not be mentioned in Hitler's presence. [[Roland Freisler]] quoted [[Franz G\u00fcrtner]] as saying, \"No one will be able to do anything for Litten. Hitler turned red with rage from just hearing Litten's name, once bellowing at Crown Prince [[Wilhelm of Prussia]], 'Anyone who advocates for Litten lands in the concentration camp, even you.'\"<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\n==== Excerpts from the trial ====\n'''Litten''': (\u2026) Did you know that in the circles of the SA there is talk of a special ''roll[[kommando]]''?<br />\n'''Hitler''': I haven't heard anything about a ''rollkommando''.

The theme (\u2026) is absolutely of no account to the Party, as the booklet doesn't bear the Party emblem and is also not officially sanctioned by the Party. (\u2026)<br />\n'''Litten''': Must it not be measured against Goebbels' example, to awaken the notion in the Party, that the legality scheme is not far away, if you neither reprimanded nor shut out a man like Goebbels, rather straightaway made him head of Reich Propaganda?<br />\n'''Hitler''': The entire Party stands on legal ground and Goebbels (\u2026) likewise.

(\u2026) I have concluded that the journal is sanctioned by the Party. (\u2026)<br />\n'''Presiding judge''': Herr Hitler, in point of fact, you testified this morning, that Goebbels' work is not official Party [material].<br />\n'''Hitler''': And it isn't, either.

In January 1932, there was a brawl involving about 150 [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]] and colony residents. The troopers surrounded the colony and attacked with stones and firearms. Two people were killed, Ernst Schwartz, a member of the Berlin SA and Fritz Klemke, a Communist; several others, including two police officers, were injured. The resulting trial had numerous defendants and  hundreds of witnesses.<ref name=\"dubber\" />\n\nLitten's meticulousness began to annoy both the presiding judge and the prosecutors, who began to conspire to get Litten removed from the trial. Although there were no legal grounds,<ref name=\"dubber\" /> the court expelled Hans Litten both as counsel and ancillary counsel for the plaintiff because he had \"unfurled unrestrained partisan propaganda in the trial\" and \"made the courtroom a hotbed of political passions\". This decision was set aside by the court of appeals, whereupon the presiding judge and an official from the criminal division declared the trial to be biased and the trial was unable to proceed.<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nShortly after that, Litten was again removed from a high court, having been accused of influencing a witness.

Hitler was so rattled by the experience that, years later, he would not allow Litten's name to be mentioned in his presence. In retaliation, Litten was arrested on the night of the [[Reichstag fire]] along with other [[progressivism|progressive]] lawyers and [[leftist]]s. Litten spent the rest of his life in one [[German concentration camp]] or another, enduring torture and many interrogations. After five years and a move to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], where his treatment worsened and he was cut off from all outside communication, he committed suicide.\n\nA number of memorials to him exist in Germany, but Litten was largely ignored for decades because his politics did not fit comfortably in either the west or the communist postwar propaganda. Not until 2011 was Litten finally portrayed in the mass media, when the [[BBC]] broadcast ''[[The Man Who Crossed Hitler]]'', a television film set in Berlin in summer 1931.\n\n== Biographical details ==\n\n=== The early years ===\nLitten was born the eldest of three sons in a wealthy family in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]].

The family left Halle in 1906 and moved to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in [[Prussia]].\n\nLitten himself was [[baptism|baptized]] a Christian, but as a youngster learned [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], choosing it as one of the subjects for his ''[[Abitur]]'' examinations. From his mother, Litten acquired an interest in [[Humanism|humanitarian ideas]] and art, and gained a strong sense of [[justice]] for the threatened, persecuted and disenfranchised.

There is an anecdote from Litten's school years, when he was asked in the classroom if they should hang a picture of [[Paul von Hindenburg]], victor of the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|1914 Battle of Tannenberg]].

The [[Kapp Putsch]], the [[Beer Hall Putsch#Trial and prison|1924 court case]] against [[Adolf Hitler]] and other events convinced Litten that Germany was approaching a very dangerous period. His perception that right-wing radicals were receiving more lenient treatment in court than their opponents led to his decision to become a lawyer.<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nLitten passed his examinations in 1927 with excellent grades and was offered a lucrative job in the [[Reich Ministry of Justice]], as well as a good position in a flourishing law firm.

He had a photographic memory and was considered to have a brilliant intellect.\n\n=== Cross-examination of Hitler ===\nIn May 1931, Litten summoned [[Adolf Hitler]] to testify in the [[#1931: Tanzpalast Eden Trial|Tanzpalast Eden Trial]], a court case involving two workers stabbed by four [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men. Litten cross examined Hitler for three hours, finding many points of contradiction and proving that Hitler had exhorted the SA to embark on a systematic campaign of violence against the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]' enemies. This was crucial because Hitler was meanwhile trying to pose as a conventional politician to middle class voters and maintained that the [[Nazi Party]] was \"strictly legal\". Though a judge halted Litten's questioning, thus saving Hitler from further damning exposure, newspapers at the time reported on the trial in detail and Hitler was investigated for perjury that summer.

He attempted suicide in 1933 in an attempt to avoid endangering his former clients, but he was revived by the Nazis so that they could interrogate him further. Litten's suicide attempt came at [[Spandau Prison]], after he buckled under torture administered to extract information about the Felsenecke trial (see below). After revealing some information, he was immediately accused in the press as an accomplice to the murder of an SA man.

Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then he was allowed to work in the book bindery and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage.<ref name=\"cord\" /> One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance.

The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words.<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\n=== Dachau and death ===\nIn summer 1937, Litten was sent to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] for a month, before finally being sent to Dachau. He arrived on 16 October  1937 and was put in the Jewish barracks. The Jewish prisoners were isolated from others because Jews in other countries were then spreading the grim news about Dachau. Litten's last letter to his family, written in November 1937, spoke of the situation, adding that the Jewish prisoners were soon to be denied mail privileges until further notice. All letters from Jewish prisoners at Dachau ceased at this time.<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\nIn the face of their depressing situation, the Jews at Dachau made efforts to have culture and discussion in their lives, to keep their spirits up.

He also had recently told his friends that he'd had enough of being imprisoned. Another of Litten's Dachau friends, Alfred Gr\u00fcnebaum, said later that Litten was in constant fear of more brutal interrogations and that Litten had given up on ever being free. On the evening of 4 February 1938, it was clear what Litten had in mind, but no one kept watch.

He represented workers who were sentenced in March 1921 to a long term at hard labor in a ''[[Prisons in Germany#Law|Zuchthaus]]'' for organized resistance against a police raid of a [[Ruhr Uprising|mass uprising in the central German industrial region]] a year earlier. The police raid was ordered by the Prussian Minister of the Interior, [[Carl Severing]].<ref>Ludger Grevelh\u00f6rster, [http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/input_felder/langDatensatz_ebene4.php?urlID=39&url_tabelle=tab_websegmente \"Kapp-Putsch und Ruhraufstand 1920\"] ''Geschichte Westfalens in der Weimarer Republik'', Internet Portal \u2013 Westphalian History (Internet-Portal \"Westf\u00e4lische Geschichte\") Retrieved June 3, 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> Litten was able to get some of the workers recognized as political actors, making them eligible under the [[amnesty]] law of August 1920.\n\nThrough his law partner, Barbasch, Litten got involved with the ''[[Rote Hilfe]]'', a solidarity organization founded by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Clara Zetkin]] that supported worker's families in dire need during the [[Weimar Republic#Years of crisis (1919\u20131923)|turbulent early years]] of the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>[http://www.uni-protokolle.de/Lexikon/Rote_Hilfe.html \"Rote Hilfe\"] Retrieved June 3, 2010 {{in lang|de}}</ref> In addition, the ''Rote Hilfe'' arranged legal support and [[Criminal defense lawyer|legal defense]] for workers who were under [[indictment]] for their political activities or views. By mid 1929, the ''Rote Hilfe'' had helped nearly 16,000 arrested workers with legal defense and supported the legal rights of another 27,000 cases.\n\n=== 1929: May Day Trial ===\nIn 1929, Litten defended participants in the 1929 [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] rally in Berlin, known as [[Blutmai]] (\"Bloody May 1929\"). Annual workers' rallies on 1 May had been taking place since 1889. In 1929, however, the rally turned bloody when the police intervened with excessive force.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\">{{Harvnb|Hett|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-WRKn8OyVMC&pg=PA58 58]}}.</ref> Confrontations between demonstrators and police erupted and the police began firing into crowds and buildings, killing 33 and injuring hundreds, including many bystanders. The workers were charged with severe [[breach of the peace]] and with [[sedition]].\n\nIn preparation for a defense, Litten founded a committee with [[Alfred D\u00f6blin]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Carl von Ossietzky]] to investigate the event. Litten himself had been at the demonstration and observed the brutal actions of the police. When he went to one man's aid and began writing down the names of victims and eyewitnesses, he was himself beaten by a policeman, even though he had identified himself as a lawyer. Litten filed an indictment against the Berlin police president, {{ill|Karl Friedrich Z\u00f6rgiebel|de}}, for 33 counts of incitement to commit murder.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> In his legal notice, he stated:\n\n{{cquote|Z\u00f6rgiebel has been a member of the Social Democratic Party for many years. He therefore knows that even in [[Imperial Germany]] and [[czarist Russia]], workers have never foregone the right to May Day demonstrations because of a police ban. He also knows that a socialist-educated working class will never let this right be taken away. If the defendant still upheld the ban on demonstrations, he also knew there would still be a demonstration. As a person of normal intelligence, the defendant knew that lifting the ban on demonstration would not have come even close to the terrible effect from violent enforcement of the ban.}}\n\nLitten's approach was to focus on the legality of the police actions. Rather than pursue individual police officers, he sought to hold the authority, the police chief, to account and he held that Z\u00f6rgiebel had ordered the police to use [[Baton (law enforcement)|truncheons]] and live ammunition against the demonstrators. If the police action was illegal under the [[criminal code]], the resulting deaths were then murders and anything done by the demonstrators to resist was \"self-defense in the full legal sense\".<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> He argued that Z\u00f6rgiebel had ordered the police invasion for political, rather than policing considerations. As proof, he produced a 2 May 1929 article from the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', where Z\u00f6rgiebel had written a defense of his actions that showed its political basis. According to Prussian law, police could use \"necessary measures\" to maintain public peace and security or prevent a public danger; in other words, it was to be police work and not the result of political conditions.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" />\n\n[[File:Berlin, Littenstrasse , Hans-Litten-Haus 007.jpg|thumb|right|Hans Litten Haus on Littenstra\u00dfe in Berlin]]\nThe indictment of Z\u00f6rgiebel was rejected by the state prosecutors and Litten appealed.<ref name=\"Hett 2008 58\" /> Z\u00f6rgiebel turned around and filed charges against a worker who had slapped his ear. Litten then took on this worker's defense, arguing that the worker had acted out of justifiable anger about Z\u00f6rgiebel's 33 murders. The justice rejected Litten's request to produce evidence on the grounds that the 33-count murder indictment against Z\u00f6rgiebel could be accepted as fact without dropping the culpability of the worker who had hit Z\u00f6rgiebel on the ear.\nThe objective in Litten's many lawsuits for the victims of the police attacks and raids was not to litigate individual incidents, but rather to warn about the growing fascism in the country. He worked to put Nazi terror on display, in the hopes it would awaken the public to the threat facing them.<ref name=\"cord\" /> He saw the methods of the police as approaching those of civil war and as being illegal and worked to prove that in court and to pursue the responsible parties wherever they were, even in the highest political circles. He wasn't interested in creating socialist [[martyr]]s, rather he sought [[acquittal]] or an appropriate punishment, which caused him some conflicts with the Rote Hilfe and the KPD.\n\n=== 1931: Tanzpalast Eden Trial ===\nOn November 22, 1930, an [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] [[Rollkommando]] attacked a popular dance hall frequented predominantly by left-wing workers. The victims were members of a migrant workers' association that was holding a meeting at the Tanzpalast Eden (\"Eden Dance Palace\") in Berlin. Three people were killed and 20 injured in an attack that was planned in advance. The subsequent police investigation was plodding and slow.\n\nLitten used four of the injured to represent the [[plaintiff]], seeking to prove three cases of attempted [[manslaughter]], breach of the peace and [[assault]]. In addition to pursuing criminal convictions of the offenders, Litten wanted to show that the Nazis intentionally used terror as a tactic to destroy the democratic structures of the Weimar Republic. Hitler was summoned to appear as a witness in court to that end.\n\nShortly before, in September 1930, Hitler had appeared in [[Leipzig]] as a witness at the \"Ulm [[Reichswehr]] Trial\" against two officers charged with conspiracy to commit [[treason]] for having had membership in the [[Nazi Party]], at that time, forbidden to Reichswehr personnel.<ref name=\"cord\" /><ref name=\"wheeler\">John Wheeler-Bennett, ''The Nemesis of Power'', pp. 218-219. (1967) Macmillan, London</ref> Hitler had insisted that his party operated legally, that the phrase \"National Revolution\"<ref group=Note>In Germany, the term \"National Revolution\" is not just a reference to the French [[R\u00e9volution nationale]], but rather a term that describes the ideology and forces embraced by the [[Vichy government]], the efforts of European right-wing extremists to transform a civil-parliamentarian society into an anti-democratic, nationalist authoritarian one.</ref> was to be interpreted only \"politically\", and that his Party was a friend, not an enemy of the Reichswehr.<ref name=\"wheeler\" /> Under oath, Hitler had described the SA as an organization of \"intellectual enlightenment\" and explained his statement that \"heads will roll\" as a comment about \"intellectual revolution\".<ref group=Note>After the [[Machtergreifung]], however, Hitler elaborated further, saying \"there will be a German State Court and the [[German Revolution|November 1918]] [Revolution] will find atonement and heads will roll\".</ref>\n\nThe court called Hitler to appear on the witness stand on 8 May 1931. Litten set out to show that the SA ''Sturm 33'' (\"Storm 33\") was a ''rollkommando'' (a small, mobile paramilitary unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership.<ref name=\"cord\" /> This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts to be seen as a serious politician and statesman.\n\nHitler never forgot the Eden trial, and held a personal antipathy towards Litten.<ref name=\"cord\" /> Years later, Litten's name still could not be mentioned in Hitler's presence. [[Roland Freisler]] quoted [[Franz G\u00fcrtner]] as saying, \"No one will be able to do anything for Litten. Hitler turned red with rage from just hearing Litten's name, once bellowing at Crown Prince [[Wilhelm of Prussia]], 'Anyone who advocates for Litten lands in the concentration camp, even you.'\"<ref name=\"momfights\" />\n\n==== Excerpts from the trial ====\n'''Litten''': (\u2026) Did you know that in the circles of the SA there is talk of a special ''roll[[kommando]]''?<br />\n'''Hitler''': I haven't heard anything about a ''rollkommando''.

(\u2026)<br />\n(The presiding judge read a question formulated by Litten): Did Hitler, as he named Goebbels \"Reichsleiter\" (Leader for the empire) of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, know of the passage from his book, where Goebbels declares that fear of the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] cannot be permitted, that parliament should be blown up and the government hunted to hell and where the call to revolution was made again, [[Letter-spacing|letter-spaced]]?<br />\n'''Hitler''': I can no longer testify under oath, if I knew Goebbels' book at the time. The theme (\u2026) is absolutely of no account to the Party, as the booklet doesn't bear the Party emblem and is also not officially sanctioned by the Party. (\u2026)<br />\n'''Litten''': Must it not be measured against Goebbels' example, to awaken the notion in the Party, that the legality scheme is not far away, if you neither reprimanded nor shut out a man like Goebbels, rather straightaway made him head of Reich Propaganda?<br />\n'''Hitler''': The entire Party stands on legal ground and Goebbels (\u2026) likewise.

(\u2026) I have concluded that the journal is sanctioned by the Party. (\u2026)<br />\n'''Presiding judge''': Herr Hitler, in point of fact, you testified this morning, that Goebbels' work is not official Party [material].<br />\n'''Hitler''': And it isn't, either.

In January 1932, there was a brawl involving about 150 [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]] and colony residents. The troopers surrounded the colony and attacked with stones and firearms. Two people were killed, Ernst Schwartz, a member of the Berlin SA and Fritz Klemke, a Communist; several others, including two police officers, were injured. The resulting trial had numerous defendants and  hundreds of witnesses.<ref name=\"dubber\" />\n\nLitten's meticulousness began to annoy both the presiding judge and the prosecutors, who began to conspire to get Litten removed from the trial. Although there were no legal grounds,<ref name=\"dubber\" /> the court expelled Hans Litten both as counsel and ancillary counsel for the plaintiff because he had \"unfurled unrestrained partisan propaganda in the trial\" and \"made the courtroom a hotbed of political passions\". This decision was set aside by the court of appeals, whereupon the presiding judge and an official from the criminal division declared the trial to be biased and the trial was unable to proceed.<ref name=\"cord\" />\n\nShortly after that, Litten was again removed from a high court, having been accused of influencing a witness. This time, the action was sustained by the ''Kammergericht'' (Supreme Court) and the court commented further during an investigation of the defense, that the main trial was generally inadmissible. This caused an uproar in the community of Berlin lawyers, including those who were not well-disposed toward Litten.

It was destroyed by [[Attila]] of the Huns in 452. The town recovered, but it was later abandoned due to its area becoming covered with sand brought by the sea. Its inhabitants moved to [[Torcello]] and other islands of the northern part of the lagoon.\n\nToday Altinum is an archaeological area and has a national archaeological museum.\n\n==Pre-Roman Altinum==\nAltium was a Venetic settlement.

This led to a gradual ethnic mixing and loss of cultural identity, especially in the border areas of the Veneti; Verona in the west and the  Lagoon of Venice and the Piave valley in the east.  In some places there was at times a transition to the traditional practice of [[cremation]] to [[inhumation]] and the deposition of weapon in burials, which was an exception to Veneti funerary culture. An example of this was found in a cemetery in Altinum. Such evidence suggests that inter-ethnic relations went beyond just trade and that there were clusters of foreign settlers. Perhaps they were traders, workers and/or mercenaries.<ref name =Capuis />\n\nStrabo gave indications of the social, economic and ritual importance horses and horse breeding among the pre-Roman Veneti.

There burials are dated to the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Evidence of sacrifice at the sanctuary continues into the Roman imperial period. Here the remains of some twenty horses were found alongside those of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs.

The abundance of watercourses gives the picture of a town deeply tied to water which was characteristic of towns in the [[Veneto]]. The transformation of Altinum from a Veneti to a Roman town started with the reorganisation of its marshy environment through the regulation of its waters and the expansion of its canal network. The main work was the digging of the Silocello canal to link the River Sile (which was to the north of the town) to the channel which today is called Santa Maria and which flowed to the south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon. The most important architectural finds are a town gate on the canal which marked the northern edge of the town, another public building which faced the canal which marked the southern edge of the town and a temple close to the Santa Maria channel which was restructured in a monumental form from a 5th-century BCE wooden structure.<ref name =parco/> (See the \"Port and canals\" section for Altinum's canals)\n\nIn 225 the Veneti and Romans established an alliance treaty in the run up of the [[Battle of Telamon]] between Rome and an alliance between the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] Gallic tribes of northern Italy and [[Gaesatae]] mercenaries. The foundation of the [[Roman colony|colony]] of Aquileia, in Celtic territory, as a fortress to protect northern Italy form invasions from the northeast and east was an important moment in the process of Romanisation of the Veneti and Altinum, which is traceable to the first half of the 2nd century BCE. Altinum came to be half way port and stopover between [[Ravenna]] and the new and important colony. Its port grew in size. This was also due to  the Romans promoting sea trade in the upper [[Adriatic Sea]]<ref name=porto>[https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/15810/1/17-Tirelli_295-316.pdf Tirelli M., Il Porto di Altinum]</ref>\n\nThe process of Romanisation was in part driven by the presence of Roman, Latin and [[Italic peoples|Italic]] merchants attracted to this port by lucrative trade. Inscriptions attest an early presence the [[Publicia (gens)|Publicia]], Barbia, [[Cossutia (gens)|Cossutia]] and [[Saufeia gens|Saufeia]] families in Aquileia and ''[[Virunum]]'' (modern [[Magdalensberg]]), a town in ''[[Noricum]]'' (in present-day [[Austria]]) were there was iron mining. These were families  of [[equite]] rank (the Roman entrepreneurial class). They went to Aquileia from central Italy and form there they spread to the northern markets, including Altinum.<ref name =parco/>\n\nSometime between 153 and 131 BCE the [[Via Annia]] was built. It connected ''Atria'' (modern [[Adria]]) to [[Aquileia]]. It passed through ''Patavium'' ([[Padua]]) and then it run close to the coast and passed through Altinum. In 131 BC the [[Via Popilia]], which connected ''Ariminum'' (modern [[Rimini]]), [[Ravenna]] and ''Atria'', was built. Thus, Altinum came to be connected overland to these important towns, facilitating the movement of goods. Again, its port increased in importance.<ref>Cresci Marrone G., La Romanizzazione (seconda met\u00e0 III - met\u00e0 I secolo a.c.) in Tirelli M, (ed.), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011 p. 95</ref><ref name=porto /> Its inhabitants were granted [[Latin rights]], a limited form of Roman [[citizenship]], in 89 BCE and in the last decades of the [[Roman Republic]], in 49 BCE, they acquired full Roman citizenship and were assigned to the ''Scaptia'' [[Roman tribe]]<ref name = parco/> The town became a [[municipium]], probably in 42-40  BCE.<ref name =Antichi>Cresci Marrone G., La voce degli antichi in Tirelli M., (ed.)

Some of the inhabitants of these islands moved the island group of Rivo alto, in the central part of the lagoon, 450\u2013500 years later and contributed to the development of a new city, [[Venice]]. Thus, according to the tradition, which is still deeply ingrained, the origins of Venice are related to the destruction of Altinum by Attila, its demise and the refugees who fled from this town. The invasion of northern Italy by the [[Lombards]] in 568, which spared the lagoons of the north-western coast of Italy, which were under [[Byzantine]] influence, has also been held responsible for this demise. The implicit assumption is that this gave a final blow to the remnants of the town. However, archaeological investigations have disproved this notion. Although Attila's actions may well have further contributed to the decline of the town, Altinum overcame this and continued to exist for several centuries.\n\nThe features of the coast of north-eastern Italy were changing. The Altinum area slowly became covered by sand brought by the sea which turned into mud, starting from the Roman imperial period. Generally, the inland Roman towns, from [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]] to Ravenna, were becoming less and less suited as ports. There was a shift from single ports controlled by the imperial authorities to peripheral ports in satellite areas along new river routes most probably controlled by new investors and ship owners. Trade moved these places. In the case of Altinum it moved to Torcello, which was on a fluvial channel through the lagoon which led to the open sea. Archaeological excavations in the inland towns and the lagoons have not revealed any sudden population movements and sharp population increases in the satellite ports or in Torcello as could be expected with an influx of refugees. The finds show that there was a gradual colonisation of the lagoons, a slow shift over centuries which had already started in the Roman days.<ref name=Torcello>[https://www.academia.edu/7886889/Quando_Torcello_Era_Abitata Calaon D., Quando Torcello Era Abitata (When Torcello was inhabited), Regione del Veneto, 2013.

Agriculture played a secondary but fundamental role in favouring new stable settlements through intensive cultivation of limited land areas, which were probably uncultivated. If so, they could be used by military elites who had the means for productive and, above all, infrastructural investment. In Torcello, embankments were built to protect the island. Mooring facilities and warehouses were built to service sea trade.<ref name =Torcello /><ref name = Calaon /> Calaon argues that archaeology shows that the bishop of Torcello, a landowning aristocrat, built his church in Torcello \"not so much because he feared barbarian raids, but because he had made a strategic choice.

The Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] (527-565) decided to annex Italy to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This led to the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]] between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths, which was won by the former. Byzantine rule in norther Italy was short-lived as the [[Lombards]] invaded northern Italy (568-73) except for the lagoons of north-eastern coast of Italy. Altinum eventually came under the duchy of Treviso of the Kingdom of the Lombards (568\u2013774).\n\n[[Narses]], the Byzantine military commander in Italy in the final stage of the Gothic War, managed to capture Vitale, the bishop of Altinum, which many years earlier had taken refuge in Auguntum in [[Noricum]], near modern [[Lienz]] <ref>Historia Latina, 2.4</ref> If there had been a partial withdrawal by Altinum's top clergy, this would have been during [[Gothic Wars]].<ref name = Possenti />\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]], the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian, wrote that the bishop of Altinum took part in the synod of Marano (590) during the  [[Schism of the Three Chapters]] (553-698).\n\nA 590 letter the Byzantine commander in Altinum wrote to [[Childebert I]], one of the kings of the [[Franks]], attests that Altinum still had town walls.<ref>Sartor I.,  Altino mmedievale e moderna, Dosson, (Treviso), 1990, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe move of the bishop of Torcello is assigned to the 5th century or within the 7th century.

An instance of this may be found in the Gallic marshes which are round Altinum, Ravenna, Aquileia and other townships in like places which are nearest the marshes.

This makes archaeological research easier and allows [[remote sensing]] surveys to be carried out.<ref name = Ninfo />\n\nThe finds of flint artefacts attributable to the [[sauveterrian]] culture have revealed the presence of [[hunter gatherer]] groups in 9500-6500 BCE. The [[wetland]] environment, which was rich in vegetation due to  water courses  fed by melting ices and springs in the plain made up for the survival difficulties created by the hot and arid climate of the late  [[Boreal (age)|boreal age]]. The finds of shells and sea [[molluscs]] suggest the use of food resources of the coastal environment. In those days the Lagoon of Venice had not formed yet and the coastline was a few kilometres further inland than it is now. Human presence in the areas by the Adriatic coast continued in the subsequent millennia with late Mesolithic (6,500-5,500 BCE) hunter-gatherer groups.<ref name =Bianchin>Bianchin Citton E., La fine dei tempi preistorici, in Tirelli M., (ed), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 47-49</ref>\n\nAn early [[Neolithic]] site of farmers and grazers with artefacts typical of the cultures of central-northern Italy of this time has  been found in the nearby Tessera. In Altinum artefacts dating from the Neolithic to the early [[copper age]] have been found.<ref name =Bianchin />\n\nStarting from the mid-[[bronze age]] (1600 BCE), there was a colonisation of the pain of the River Po and central-eastern Veneto. A late bronze age (1300-1000 BCE) subapennine  culture (1350-1150 BCE) site has been found to the northeast of Altinum. There have been finds dated to this period on the Siloncello canal very close to Altinum (to the northeast) and in the town. A settlement on sandy mounds close to the River [[Sile]] was abandoned in the early bronze age due to [[marine ingression]].<ref name =Bianchin />\n\nAegean pottery was found on the islands of [[Torcello]] and [[Mazzorbo]]. These were probably along a sea trade route form the [[Aegean Sea]] and the eastern Mediterranean to the Altinum area between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. This route continued to be used in the [[Iron Age]], as attested by the finds of [[Attic]] pottery in these two islands and other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice (San Tommaso dei Bognomi, San Giacomo in Paludo, [[Vignole]] and [[Sant'Erasmo]]).<ref>Bianchin Citton E., Il Veneto tra Bronzo recente e Bronzo finale: popolamento e aspetti socio-economici di un aria di cerniera tra l\u2019Adriatico  e l\u2019oltralpe in Dall\u2019Egeo all\u2019 Adriatico: organizzazioni sociali, modi di scambio e interazione in et\u00e0 postpalaziale (XII-XI sec. a.

It might have connected these two coastal centres to other coastal centres on the [[Adriatic Sea]] from the 11thcentury on and to the inland centres and the Alps via the rivers [[Sile]] and [[Piave (river)|Piave]].<ref name =Bianchin />\n\nFor information related to Altinum's contacts with Celtic groups see the Pre-Roman Altinum section above.\n\nUntil the 1990s it was thought that the origins of Altinum were dated to the 7th century BCE. More recently, a burial attributable to the late [[bronze age]] was found. It was contemporary to other materials found in the nearby areas (by the River Zero, close to the coast of the lagoon and to the east). This has led to the hypothesis that the earliest protohistoric settlement nucleus was close to the Santa Maria channel (see below). The earliest trace of human activity in Altinum is datable to the first half of the 8th century BCE. It is a simple quarry for fictile<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fictile Fictile Wiktionary]</ref> materials similar to those found in other Veneti centres dated to a slightly earlier time. The quarry was later filled in by a settlement centred around a large building (13 m long and 6.75 m wide) with two internal asymmetric spans which must have supported a double [[pitched roof]]. Soon afterwards the narrower side was widened with a portico. It was active in the second half of the 8th century BCE and was abandoned in the first quarter of the 7th century BCE. It is one of the oldest attestations of square plan buildings in the [[Veneto]]. It is derived from housing and productive prototypes found in [[Treviso]], [[Oderzo]] and [[Concordia Sagittaria]]. In the next phase, after a brief period of abandonment, the site seems to have changed to a workshop area. There was a wooden well connected to a small canal system and a small furnace until the mid-7th century BCE. Thus, the earliest evidence of a settlement nucleus is dated from the mid-8th century to the mid-7th century BCE. Then the area was briefly unused before it was devoted to a sacred area.<ref name =Gambacurta />\n\nIn the 7th century BCE the settlement moved slightly to the northwest, in its historical location. This is attested by [[aerial photography]], [[stratigraphy]] and sample excavations below the ruins of the Roman town. It was on a man-made mound. Two sacred areas have been found in diametrically opposite locations to the north and to the south of the settlement. The first one was identified indirectly through the find of a fragment of an altar with an inscription dedicated to the god Belatukadro.<ref name = parco/> The second one  was found during the restructuring works of the museum area and was excavated  from  1997 to 2000. It is dated to the late 6th century BCE and developed in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. Dedicative inscriptions in [[Venetic language]] and alphabet indicate that it was dedicated to Arno or Altinum, a god of the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]]. Thus, the town was named after this god. It had a commercial role, the protection of the trade in local agricultural and manufacturing goods and horses and the imports from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and form beyond the [[Alps]]. This is indicated by  its location by the Santa Maria channel which connected it to the lagoon. Moreover, its [[Votive offering|votive]] deposits which had objects from [[Greece]], [[Magna Graecia]] and the [[Etruscans]] in the plain of the River [[Po (river)|Po]]. Its function as an [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] is shown by inscriptions. These also show a male and military character due to the need to protect the traded goods. It was one of the main pre-Roman sanctuaries in the region.<ref name = parco/><ref name =Gambacurta />\n\nIn the 5th century BCE this sanctuary was a large outdoors space enclosed by a rectangular portico which had two symmetric cells at the centre of its short sides. Two large ash altars were found inside the courtyard and in parallel with the cells. The deposit pits with the sacrificial remains and the votive objects were found outside this area. The remains of many horses were found in a pit at the edge of the sanctuary. The sacred area progressively grew until Romanisation (2nd-1st century BCE). This denotes an increase in the number of pilgrims as the town's trade in the [[Adriatic Sea]] increased.<ref name = parco/><ref name= Cresci/> In the second half of the 1st century BCE the sanctuary came to be devoted to the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and assumed the look of a sacred wood.<ref>Cipriano S, Tirelli M, Larea sacra in Era Romana, in Cresci Marrone G., Tirelli M., (eds), Altinoi, Il Santuario altinate: Strutture del sacro a confronto dei luoghi di culto lungo la via Annia, Atti del Convegno, (Venezia, 4-6 dicembre 2006), Studi e ricerche sulla Gallia Cisalpina, Quasar,  Roma, 2009, pp. 61-80; {{ISBN|978-8871404103}}</ref>\n\nStratigraphy related to the late [[bronze age]] and the transition to the [[iron age]] was found to the south-east of the town in the late 1990s and further out to the north-east, close to the River [[Sile]], in 2005. In 2002 tombs datable to the late 6th- early 5th century BCE were found at the eastern edge of the town and to its north, by the River Zero. They were related to a cemetery investigated in the late 1970s.<ref name= Cresci /> The pre-Roman cemetery area to the north of Altinum covered the whole of the northern strip which was later crossed by the northern tract of the Via Annia and the Roman period cemetery. It stretched to the left bank of the River Zero. This arrangement of cemetery areas at the edge of a town and separated by watercourses was typical of other pre-Roman Veneti towns, such as Este and Padua. It can be surmised that watercourses had a particular role in funerary ceremonies and represented a route from the town of the living to that of the dead and a transition to the afterlife.<ref name =parco/>\n\nIn 1999-2002 ditches and cemetery areas were found in a section of the [[Via Annia]] to the south-west of Altinum. Their dating is problematic as the road was progressively widened until it reached a width of 12 m. In the area of the [[Via Claudia Augusta]], to the north-west of the town, there were traces of ditches and small canals attributable to a late antiquity systematic parcelling out of land and maintenance interventions. Larger areas of land divisions were noted in the mentioned areas to the south-west which was linked to a network of ditches and canals. Similar traces were found to the south and further away from the town (5&nbsp;km), close to the edge of the lagoon, within the  current airport area, and to the north-east, at Portegrandi, close to the edge of the lagoon.<ref name= Cresci/>\n\nExcavations in the centre of the town in 1995-97 identified a large [[Roman Baths (Bath)|baths]] complex dated between the 1st and 3rd century. In the early 1990s an investigation of the layer below a town gate on a canal pushed back its dating, which was previously attributed to the Augustan period, to the first half of the 1st century BCE and brought to light the remains of an imposing foundation ceremony. The ancient bed of a navigable canal with moorings which was an extension of the Siloncello canal (see below) was discovered in the layers below the area of the Augustan period. It traced back the creation of a systematic hydraulic plan of remediation for the delicate ecosystem by the lagoon to the first half of the 1st century BCE.<ref name= Cresci/>\n\nA 2000 systematic excavation of the cemeteries found a more than 2000 tombs and an extraordinary number of funerary monuments, which makes Altinum a prime site for the study of funerary architecture and rituals in northern Italy in the Roman imperial period. The Augustan period was a period of big [[mausolea]] especially for those of the [[baldachin]] type which was derived from [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]-Oriental models. Several sumptuous examples were found in the monumental cemetery by the Via Annia where the ruling elite started to build their grandiose burials in the last decades of the 1st century BCE. In the 1st century CE they were replaced by numerous funerary enclosures  along both fronts of this cemetery. They were sometimes aligned close to each over a length of over 170 m with mausolea alternating with various types of funerary buildings and areas taken up only by tombs. Cylindrical and octagonal altars typical of Altinum's sculptural art were a recurrent decorative element in the enclosures. They were probably placed in pairs at their corners.<ref name =parco/>\n\nThe southern tract of the Siloncello canal (see below) was blocked in the last decades of the 1st century CE to start the eastern expansion of the town. This is attested by the urban plan of the new Augustan neighbourhood.<ref name =parco/>\n\nIn 2007 a team of [[geomorphologist]]s from the University of Padua carried out a survey with visible and near-infrared (NIR) [[aerial photographs]] which were taken after a period of prolonged drought and developed a digital elevation model (DEM) to reconstruct the urban [[topography]] and the environmental setting of Altinum. NIR is highly sensitive to vegetation and crop marks highlight archaeological features.<ref name = Ninfo />\n\nThe crops were suffering from drought and were highly sensitive to the subsurface presence of stones, bricks or compacted soil. They were in different stages of ripening due to differences in the amount of water in the soil. This created lighter crop marks which indicated stonework and revealed the outlines of buildings at least 40&nbsp;cm below the surface. Darker marks indicated depressed features such as ditches and canals. To the south of the town centre there was a wide strip of riper crops which were growing above what used to be a canal. The survey covered an area of 100 [[hectares]].<ref>[https://rogueclassicism.com/2009/07/31/lost-city-of-altinum-found/ Excerpts from a Times article]</ref>\n\nThe map of the town was reconstructed in great detail, revealing the urban fabric and the waterways, the town walls and gates, the street network and previously unknown neighbourhoods and buildings, including monumental ones: the [[amphitheatre]], the [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], the [[Odeon (building)|odeon]],  and the [[Roman Forum|forum]], which are attributable to the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. The town was on top of a 2- to 3 m-high mound and in Roman times the lagoon shore probably reached the foot that mound. Altinum was probably partially surrounded by water. The researchers conclude that the results indicate a complex urban system \"adapted to the peculiarity of the lagoon environment\" and show that \"the Romans successfully exploited the amphibious environment several centuries before the city of Venice started to emerge.\" <ref name = Ninfo>[https://www.academia.edu/7738838/The_Map_of_Altinum_Ancestor_of_Venice Ninfo A., Fontana., Mozzi P, Ferrarese F., The Map of Altinum, Ancestor of Venice, Science, Vol 325, 31 July 2009, pp. 577-62]</ref>\n\nThe map of Altinum which was reconstructed through remote sensing can be seen overlaid on Google Earth.<ref>[http://www.ogleearth.com/2009/08/altinum_reveale.html Google Earth]</ref>\n\nThe political and administrative heart of the town was in the northernmost part. Here, besides the outlines of the forum, amphitheatre, theatre and odeon, the outlines of the capitolium (the temple of the [[Capitoline Triad]]) and the [[basilica]] were also identified in the 2007 remote sensing survey. The theatre had a length of 120 m and a radius of 60 m. It is dated between 40 and 20 BCE. It was one of the first ones in northern Italy and one of the first in a provincial town in the whole of Italy. The odeon was half its size. The amphitheatre was in the outskirts, to the north of the canal which marked the northern limit of the town. Its longer axis was 150 m and its size was similar to that of the [[Arena di Verona]] (which could host 30,000 people) and was larger than those of Padua and Aquileia.<ref name =parco/>\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015 [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] carried out surveys in an area in the east of the town, where a 2000 a [[geophysical]] survey indicated an urban area, roads and a building with an [[apse]] which correspond to the area of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] monumental town gate. In the 2007 survey it came out blurred. Between 1989 and 1990 there was a [[geophysical]] survey in this area and the one next to it to the east. A series of [[plinths]] along the main canal and a secondary canal which branches from it were identified. This tallies with some 1972 samplings on the eastern bank of the secondary canal which found the foundations of a brick quay resting on wooden piling and seven rectangular plinths related to a big building which is identified as a warehouse. This suggests that it was a commercial area.<ref name = Cipriano>[https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/books/978-88-6969-189-8/978-88-6969-189-8-ch-05.pdf Cipriano S., Il progetto Altino 2012-2015: il survey  in localit\u00e0 Ghiacciaia, in Sperti L, Silvia Cipriano S.,  Monica Pagan M., in Ricerche e studi ad Altino e nei Musei archeologici del Veneto,Giornata dell\u2019archeologia: scavi e ricerche del Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari, 2016, pp.74-79]</ref>\n\nIn 2012 just under half of the area was surveyed. It focused on surface finds (at a depth of 20\u201330&nbsp;cm). The area ad been devoted to medicinal plants for years and had not been ploughed. It was on a marked mound. Pottery and architectural  fragments, coins, fictile materials and other items were found. High concentrations of plaster, mosaic [[tesserae]] and architectural and stone fragments indicate that there were buildings. The 2014 campaign covered the rest of the area and used the same methods. Electromagnetic prospections detected three northeast\u2013southwest parallel gravel roads with an average length of c. 7 m and a road perpendicular to them along the northern edge of the area, which was parallel to the canal which marks the northern end of the town. Another structure with the same orientation was detected in central area of the survey, but gravel was not detected and it might have been a canal.<ref name = Cipriano />\n\nThe finds of some concentrations of glass leftovers and fragments of a [[crucible]] suggest that there were glassworks. This is an important find because it could confirm the hypothesis that Altinum had a role in glass production in the Roman days.<ref name = Cipriano />\n\n==The port and the canals==\nThe networks of ditches and canals discovered to the northwest, southwest and south of Altinum, the canals in the town and the canals which connected the town to the lagoon show that Altinum needed to both connect its port to the lagoon and to create a hydraulic system to manage the delicate hydraulic and environmental setting of the marshy area it was in. This shaped the [[geomorphology]] of the town. Vitruvius gave some indication of the management needs in marshy areas, including Altinum, and Strabo indicated that the town had a system of canals (see above). Altinum was successful in managing its often waterlogged marshy environment.\n\nAltinum was crossed in the middle by a west\u2013east main canal. An oblong semi-circular canal marked the northern limit of the central part of the town and a southern one marked the southern limit. These three canals reached the River Zero, to the west of the town. The Siloncello canal, which still exists, run in a northeast\u2013southwest oblique straight line form the River [[Sile]]. It came close to the north-eastern edge of the town. A southward extension of this canal was connected to the three mentioned canals. It continued to south of the town and reached the Santa Maria canal, which still exists and runs south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon at the Palude di Cona marsh and thus connected the port, which was to the east of the extension canal, to the lagoon. The Siloncello canal turns east at a right angle just before the town and then south, reaching the Palude di Cona slightly further east. Thus, the port could be reached through the Siloncello form the east and the Santa Maria form the west.<ref name =Porto>[https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/15810/1/17-Tirelli_295-316.pdf Tirelli M., Il Porto di Altino]</ref>\n\nThe Siloncello canal also continued eastwards and reached the River Sile, close to its mouth. At the time the River [[Piave (river)|Piave]] must have flowed into the Sile. The Piave was a preferred route for the transport of wood from the forests of [[Cadore]] towards Altinum as attested by an inscription found in [[Feltre]]. Thus, this canal was of strategic importance for the supply of wood. The remains of a 192 m long mooring dock on the western bank of the Siloncello was found in 1930 a few hundreds of metres north of the town.<ref name =Porto />\n\nA fluvial dock area found between 1988 and 1993 on the west bank of a north\u2013south canal that was aligned to the Siloncello canal. It had porticoed warehouses. The dock and the canal bed were below the urban structures of the Augustan period urban period. In this period the canal was filled in.<ref name =Porto />\n\nA monumental town gate was built following the model of urban gates with a central body and angular towers. It has been dated to the first half of the 1st century BCE. It was richly decorated. The central body with the gate had two towers at each side. The structure was flanked on both sides by two short wall tracts attached to the towers. It rested on strong pilings made with oak trunks. It was on the canal that marked the northern boundary of the town. The canal was crossed, perhaps through two arches, by the [[cardus maximus]]. This canal is now only a ditch. It was shown in a 16th-century map. It still had a considerable width, was visible and reached the River Zero in the late 19th century. It was the preferred route to take goods from the port to some presumed moorings at the northern border of the town and to the beginning of the Via Claudia Augusta.<ref name =Porto />\n\nIn 1972 the foundation of a 16.3 m brick dock with fully curved arches linked to a large building were found close to the gate, on the eastern bank of a secondary canal which branched off the main one inside the urban area. Its materials are dated to the late 1st century BCE and the mid-1st century CE. The remains of an imposing complex of porticoed docks was found along the opposite bank of the canal in an electromagnetic survey. The results indicate that it stretched for an over 120 m angled course which seems to faithfully follow the morphology of the canal, whose width was around 10 m.<ref name =Porto />\n\nThe foundations of another porticoed dock similarly linked to a large building were detected along the canal which marked the southern border of the town, whose bed was indicated by a considerable depression in the terrain in the mid-60s. It stretched eastwards immediately before the northern shoulder of the bridge which linked the [[Via Annia]] to the town. It is dated to the late Republic period. It was in a key position in the immediate vicinity of the southern entrance of the town and along a fluvial a route which started from the port and must have gone through the Santa Maria canal. This canal was connected to it. It was also liked to the Via Annia. From here goods could reach the inland markets overland via the Via Annia or by following a wide canal with wooden banks which flanked this road in the north.<ref name =Porto />\n\n==UNESCO World Heritage Site==\nThe \"Venice and her Lagoon\" [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] was established in 1987.

There was a trading relationship between high-ranking families. There was a degree of intermarriage. Some Celts settled in the region. Celtic gift and fashion objects appear in the burials of important families.<ref name =Capuis>Capuis, L. L\u2019epoca della celtizzazione, in Tirelli M., (ed.), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 81-93</ref>\n\nIn the early 4th century BCE the [[Gauls]] invaded the plain of the Po as far as  [[Verona]]. This led to a gradual ethnic mixing and loss of cultural identity, especially in the border areas of the Veneti; Verona in the west and the  Lagoon of Venice and the Piave valley in the east.  In some places there was at times a transition to the traditional practice of [[cremation]] to [[inhumation]] and the deposition of weapon in burials, which was an exception to Veneti funerary culture. An example of this was found in a cemetery in Altinum. Such evidence suggests that inter-ethnic relations went beyond just trade and that there were clusters of foreign settlers. Perhaps they were traders, workers and/or mercenaries. <ref name =Capuis></ref>\n\nStrabo gave indications of the social, economic and ritual importance horses and horse breeding among the pre-Roman Veneti. He wrote that they bestowed attention on horse rearing  \u201cwhich, though now entirely abandoned, was formerly in great esteem among them, resulting from the ancient rage for breeding mules, which [[Homer]] thus mentions: \u201c From the [Ve]neti for forest mules renowned.\" It was here that [[Dionysius I of Syracuse |Dionysius]], the tyrant of [[Sicily]], kept his stud of race-horses.

Here the remains of some twenty horses were found alongside those of bovines, sheep, goats and pigs.

The abundance of watercourses gives the picture of a town deeply tied to water which was characteristic of towns in the [[Veneto]]. The transformation of Altinum from a Veneti to a Roman town started with the reorganisation of its marshy environment through the regulation of its waters and the expansion of its canal network. The main work was the digging of the Silocello canal to link the River Sile (which was to the north of the town) to the channel which today is called Santa Maria and which flowed to the south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon. The most important architectural finds are a town gate on the canal which marked the northern edge of the town, another public building which faced the canal which marked the southern edge of the town and a temple close to the Santa Maria channel which was restructured in a monumental form from a 5th-century BCE wooden structure.<ref name =parco/> (See the \"Port and canals\" section for Altinum's canals)\n\nIn 225 the Veneti and Romans established an alliance treaty in the run up of the [[Battle of Telamon]] between Rome and an alliance between the [[Insubres]] and [[Boii]] Gallic tribes of northern Italy and [[Gaesatae]] mercenaries. The foundation of the [[Roman colony | colony]] of Aquileia, in Celtic territory, as a fortress to protect northern Italy form invasions from the northeast and east was an important moment in the process of Romanisation of the Veneti and Altinum, which is traceable to the first half of the 2nd century BCE. Altinum came to be half way port and stopover between [[Ravenna]] and the new and important colony. Its port grew in size. This was also due to  the Romans promoting sea trade in the upper [[Adriatic Sea]]<ref name=porto>[https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/15810/1/17-Tirelli_295-316.pdf Tirelli M., Il Porto di Altinum]</ref> \n\nThe process of Romanisation was in part driven by the presence of Roman, Latin and [[Italic peoples |Italic]] merchants attracted to this port by lucrative trade. Inscriptions attest an early presence the [[Publicia (gens) | Publicia]], Barbia, [[Cossutia (gens) | Cossutia]] and [[Saufeia gens | Saufeia]] families in Aquileia and ''[[Virunum]]'' (modern [[Magdalensberg]]), a town in ''[[Noricum]]'' (in present-day [[Austria]]) were there was iron mining. These were families  of [[equite]] rank (the Roman entrepreneurial class). They went to Aquileia from central Italy and form there they spread to the northern markets, including Altinum.<ref name =parco/>\n\nSometime between 153 and 131 BCE the [[Via Annia]] was built. It connected ''Atria'' (modern [[Adria]]) to [[Aquileia]]. It passed through ''Patavium'' ([[Padua]]) and then it run close to the coast and passed through Altinum. In 131 BC the [[Via Popilia]], which connected ''Ariminum'' (modern [[Rimini]]), [[Ravenna]] and ''Atria'', was built. Thus, Altinum came to be connected overland to these important towns, facilitating the movement of goods. Again, its port increased in importance.<ref>Cresci Marrone G., La Romanizzazione (seconda met\u00e0 III - met\u00e0 I secolo a.c.) in Tirelli M, (ed.), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011 p. 95</ref><ref name=porto></ref> Its inhabitants were granted [[Latin rights]], a limited form of Roman [[citizenship]], in 89 BCE and in the last decades of the [[Roman Republic]], in 49 BCE, they acquired full Roman citizenship and were assigned to the ''Scaptia'' [[Roman tribe]]<ref name = parco/> The town became a [[municipium]], probably in 42-40  BCE.<ref name =Antichi> Cresci Marrone G., La voce degli antichi in Tirelli M., (ed.)

Some of the inhabitants of these islands moved the island group of Rivo alto, in the central part of the lagoon, 450-500 years later and contributed to the development of a new city, [[Venice]]. Thus, according to the tradition, which is still deeply ingrained, the origins of Venice are related to the destruction of Altinum by Attila, its demise and the refugees who fled from this town. The invasion of northern Italy by the [[Lombards]] in 568, which spared the lagoons of the north-western coast of Italy, which were under [[Byzantine]] influence, has also been held responsible for this demise. The implicit assumption is that this gave a final blow to the remnants of the town. However, archaeological investigations have disproved this notion. Although Attila's actions may well have further contributed to the decline of the town, Altinum overcame this and continued to exist for several centuries.  \n\nThe features of the coast of north-eastern Italy were changing. The Altinum area slowly became covered by sand brought by the sea which turned into mud, starting from the Roman imperial period. Generally, the inland Roman towns, from [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]] to Ravenna, were becoming less and less suited as ports. There was a shift from single ports controlled by the imperial authorities to peripheral ports in satellite areas along new river routes most probably controlled by new investors and ship owners. Trade moved these places. In the case of Altinum it moved to Torcello, which was on a fluvial channel through the lagoon which led to the open sea. Archaeological excavations in the inland towns and the lagoons have not revealed any sudden population movements and sharp population increases in the satellite ports or in Torcello as could be expected with an influx of refugees. The finds show that there was a gradual colonisation of the lagoons, a slow shift over centuries which had already started in the Roman days.<ref name=Torcello>[https://www.academia.edu/7886889/Quando_Torcello_Era_Abitata Calaon D., Quando Torcello Era Abitata (When Torcello was inhabited), Regione del Veneto, 2013.

Agriculture played a secondary but fundamental role in favouring new stable settlements through intensive cultivation of limited land areas, which were probably uncultivated. If so, they could be used by military elites who had the means for productive and, above all, infrastructural investment. In Torcello, embankments were built to protect the island. Mooring facilities and warehouses were built to service sea trade.<ref name =Torcello></ref><ref name = Calaon></ref> Calaon argues that archaeology shows that the bishop of Torcello, a landowning aristocrat, built his church in Torcello \"not so much because he feared barbarian raids, but because he had made a strategic choice.

The Byzantine emperor [[Justinian I]] (527-565) decided to annex Italy to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This led to the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]] between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths, which was won by the former. Byzantine rule in norther Italy was short-lived as the [[Lombards]] invaded northern Italy (568-73) except for the lagoons of north-eastern coast of Italy. Altinum eventually came under the duchy of Treviso of the Kingdom of the Lombards (568\u2013774). \n\n[[Narses]], the Byzantine military commander in Italy in the final stage of the Gothic War, managed to capture Vitale, the bishop of Altinum, which many years earlier had taken refuge in Auguntum in [[Noricum]], near modern [[Lienz]] <ref>Historia Latina, 2.4</ref> If there had been a partial withdrawal by Altinum's top clergy, this would have been during [[Gothic Wars]]. <ref name = Possenti></ref>\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]], the [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian, wrote that the bishop of Altinum took part in the synod of Marano (590) during the  [[Schism of the Three Chapters]] (553-698). \n\nA 590 letter the Byzantine commander in Altinum wrote to [[Childebert I]], one of the kings of the [[Franks]], attests that Altinum still had town walls.<ref>Sartor I.,  Altino mmedievale e moderna, Dosson, (Treviso), 1990, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe move of the bishop of Torcello is assigned to the 5th century or within the 7th century.

An instance of this may be found in the Gallic marshes which are round Altinum, Ravenna, Aquileia and other townships in like places which are nearest the marshes.

Altinum is the only large Roman town in Northern Italy and one of the few in Europe where [[medieval]] towns were not built on top of them. This makes archaeological research easier and allows [[remote sensing]] surveys to be carried out.<ref name = Ninfo></ref>\n\nThe finds of flint artefacts attributable to the [[sauveterrian]] culture have revealed the presence of [[hunter gatherer]] groups in 9500-6500 BCE. The [[wetland]] environment, which was rich in vegetation due to  water courses  fed by melting ices and springs in the plain made up for the survival difficulties created by the hot and arid climate of the late  [[Boreal (age)|boreal age]]. The finds of shells and sea [[molluscs]] suggest the use of food resources of the coastal environment. In those days the Lagoon of Venice had not formed yet and the coastline was a few kilometres further inland than it is now. Human presence in the areas by the Adriatic coast continued in the subsequent millennia with late Mesolithic (6,500-5,500 BCE) hunter-gatherer groups.<ref name =Bianchin>Bianchin Citton E., La fine dei tempi preistorici, in Tirelli M., (ed), Altino Antica, dai Veneti a Venezia, Marsilio, 2011, pp. 47-49</ref>\n\nAn early [[Neolithic]] site of farmers and grazers with artefacts typical of the cultures of central-northern Italy of this time has  been found in the nearby Tessera. In Altinum artefacts dating from the Neolithic to the early [[copper age]] have been found.<ref name =Bianchin></ref>\n\nStarting from the mid-[[bronze age]] (1600 BCE), there was a colonisation of the pain of the River Po and central-eastern Veneto. A late bronze age (1300-1000 BCE) subapennine  culture (1350-1150 BCE) site has been found to the northeast of Altinum. There have been finds dated to this period on the Siloncello canal very close to Altinum (to the northeast) and in the town. A settlement on sandy mounds close to the River [[Sile]] was abandoned in the early bronze age due to [[marine ingression]].<ref name =Bianchin></ref> \n\nAegean pottery was found on the islands of [[Torcello]] and [[Mazzorbo]]. These were probably along a sea trade route form the [[Aegean Sea]] and the eastern Mediterranean to the Altinum area between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. This route continued to be used in the [[Iron Age]], as attested by the finds of [[Attic]] pottery in these two islands and other islands in the northern part of the Lagoon of Venice (San Tommaso dei Bognomi, San Giacomo in Paludo, [[Vignole]] and [[Sant'Erasmo]]).<ref>Bianchin Citton E., Il Veneto tra Bronzo recente e Bronzo finale: popolamento e aspetti socio-economici di un aria di cerniera tra l\u2019Adriatico  e l\u2019oltralpe in Dall\u2019Egeo all\u2019 Adriatico: organizzazioni sociali, modi di scambio e interazione in et\u00e0 postpalaziale (XII-XI sec. a.

Text in English and Italia</ref> \n\nA land path with a fort equipped with wooden elements has also been traced Ca\u2019 Tron and Portegrandi, to the northeast of Altinum. It preceded the via Annia. It might have connected these two coastal centres to other coastal centres on the [[Adriatic Sea]] from the 11thcentury on and to the inland centres and the Alps via the rivers [[Sile]] and [[Piave (river)|Piave]].<ref name =Bianchin></ref> \n\nFor information related to Altinum's contacts with Celtic groups see the Pre-Roman Altinum section above. \n\nUntil the 1990s it was thought that the origins of Altinum were dated to the 7th century BCE. More recently, a burial attributable to the late [[bronze age]] was found. It was contemporary to other materials found in the nearby areas (by the River Zero, close to the coast of the lagoon and to the east). This has led to the hypothesis that the earliest protohistoric settlement nucleus was close to the Santa Maria channel (see below). The earliest trace of human activity in Altinum is datable to the first half of the 8th century BCE. It is a simple quarry for fictile<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fictile Fictile Wiktionary]</ref> materials similar to those found in other Veneti centres dated to a slightly earlier time. The quarry was later filled in by a settlement centred around a large building (13 m long and 6.75 m wide) with two internal asymmetric spans which must have supported a double [[pitched roof]]. Soon afterwards the narrower side was widened with a portico. It was active in the second half of the 8th century BCE and was abandoned in the first quarter of the 7th century BCE. It is one of the oldest attestations of square plan buildings in the [[Veneto]]. It is derived from housing and productive prototypes found in [[Treviso]], [[Oderzo]] and [[Concordia Sagittaria]]. In the next phase, after a brief period of abandonment, the site seems to have changed to a workshop area. There was a wooden well connected to a small canal system and a small furnace until the mid-7th century BCE. Thus, the earliest evidence of a settlement nucleus is dated from the mid-8th century to the mid-7th century BCE. Then the area was briefly unused before it was devoted to a sacred area.<ref name =Gambacurta></ref>\n\nIn the 7th century BCE the settlement moved slightly to the northwest, in its historical location. This is attested by [[aerial photography]], [[stratigraphy]] and sample excavations below the ruins of the Roman town. It was on a man-made mound. Two sacred areas have been found in diametrically opposite locations to the north and to the south of the settlement. The first one was identified indirectly through the find of a fragment of an altar with an inscription dedicated to the god Belatukadro.<ref name = parco/> The second one  was found during the restructuring works of the museum area and was excavated  from  1997 to 2000. It is dated to the late 6th century BCE and developed in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. Dedicative inscriptions in [[Venetic language]] and alphabet indicate that it was dedicated to Arno or Altinum, a god of the [[Adriatic Veneti |Veneti]]. Thus, the town was named after this god. It had a commercial role, the protection of the trade in local agricultural and manufacturing goods and horses and the imports from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and form beyond the [[Alps]]. This is indicated by  its location by the Santa Maria channel which connected it to the lagoon. Moreover, its [[Votive offering|votive]] deposits which had objects from [[Greece]], [[Magna Graecia]] and the [[Etruscans]] in the plain of the River [[Po (river)|Po]]. Its function as an [[Emporium (antiquity)| emporium]] is shown by inscriptions. These also show a male and military character due to the need to protect the traded goods. It was one of the main pre-Roman sanctuaries in the region.<ref name = parco/><ref name =Gambacurta></ref>\n\nIn the 5th century BCE this sanctuary was a large outdoors space enclosed by a rectangular portico which had two symmetric cells at the centre of its short sides. Two large ash altars were found inside the courtyard and in parallel with the cells. The deposit pits with the sacrificial remains and the votive objects were found outside this area. The remains of many horses were found in a pit at the edge of the sanctuary. The sacred area progressively grew until Romanisation (2nd-1st century BCE). This denotes an increase in the number of pilgrims as the town's trade in the [[Adriatic Sea]] increased.<ref name = parco/><ref name= Cresci/> In the second half of the 1st century BCE the sanctuary came to be devoted to the Roman god [[Jupiter]] and assumed the look of a sacred wood.<ref>Cipriano S, Tirelli M, Larea sacra in Era Romana, in Cresci Marrone G., Tirelli M., (eds), Altinoi, Il Santuario altinate: Strutture del sacro a confronto dei luoghi di culto lungo la via Annia, Atti del Convegno, (Venezia, 4-6 dicembre 2006), Studi e ricerche sulla Gallia Cisalpina, Quasar,  Roma, 2009, pp. 61-80; {{ISBN|978-8871404103}}</ref>\n\nStratigraphy related to the late [[bronze age]] and the transition to the [[iron age]] was found to the south-east of the town in the late 1990s and further out to the north-east, close to the River [[Sile]], in 2005. In 2002 tombs datable to the late 6th- early 5th century BCE were found at the eastern edge of the town and to its north, by the River Zero. They were related to a cemetery investigated in the late 1970s.<ref name= Cresci></ref> The pre-Roman cemetery area to the north of Altinum covered the whole of the northern strip which was later crossed by the northern tract of the Via Annia and the Roman period cemetery. It stretched to the left bank of the River Zero. This arrangement of cemetery areas at the edge of a town and separated by watercourses was typical of other pre-Roman Veneti towns, such as Este and Padua. It can be surmised that watercourses had a particular role in funerary ceremonies and represented a route from the town of the living to that of the dead and a transition to the afterlife.<ref name =parco/>\n\nIn 1999-2002 ditches and cemetery areas were found in a section of the [[Via Annia]] to the south-west of Altinum. Their dating is problematic as the road was progressively widened until it reached a width of 12 m. In the area of the [[Via Claudia Augusta]], to the north-west of the town, there were traces of ditches and small canals attributable to a late antiquity systematic parcelling out of land and maintenance interventions. Larger areas of land divisions were noted in the mentioned areas to the south-west which was linked to a network of ditches and canals. Similar traces were found to the south and further away from the town (5 km), close to the edge of the lagoon, within the  current airport area, and to the north-east, at Portegrandi, close to the edge of the lagoon.<ref name= Cresci/>\n\nExcavations in the centre of the town in 1995-97 identified a large [[Roman Baths (Bath)|baths]] complex dated between the 1st and 3rd century. In the early 1990s an investigation of the layer below a town gate on a canal pushed back its dating, which was previously attributed to the Augustan period, to the first half of the 1st century BCE and brought to light the remains of an imposing foundation ceremony. The ancient bed of a navigable canal with moorings which was an extension of the Siloncello canal (see below) was discovered in the layers below the area of the Augustan period. It traced back the creation of a systematic hydraulic plan of remediation for the delicate ecosystem by the lagoon to the first half of the 1st century BCE.<ref name= Cresci/>\n\nA 2000 systematic excavation of the cemeteries found a more than 2000 tombs and an extraordinary number of funerary monuments, which makes Altinum a prime site for the study of funerary architecture and rituals in northern Italy in the Roman imperial period. The Augustan period was a period of big [[mausolea]] especially for those of the [[baldachin]] type which was derived from [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]-Oriental models. Several sumptuous examples were found in the monumental cemetery by the Via Annia where the ruling elite started to build their grandiose burials in the last decades of the 1st century BCE. In the 1st century CE they were replaced by numerous funerary enclosures  along both fronts of this cemetery. They were sometimes aligned close to each over a length of over 170 m with mausolea alternating with various types of funerary buildings and areas taken up only by tombs. Cylindrical and octagonal altars typical of Altinum's sculptural art were a recurrent decorative element in the enclosures. They were probably placed in pairs at their corners.<ref name =parco/>  \n\nThe southern tract of the Siloncello canal (see below) was blocked in the last decades of the 1st century CE to start the eastern expansion of the town. This is attested by the urban plan of the new Augustan neighbourhood.<ref name =parco/>\n\nIn 2007 a team of [[geomorphologist]]s from the University of Padua carried out a survey with visible and near-infrared (NIR) [[aerial photographs]] which were taken after a period of prolonged drought and developed a digital elevation model (DEM) to reconstruct the urban [[topography]] and the environmental setting of Altinum. NIR is highly sensitive to vegetation and crop marks highlight archaeological features.<ref name = Ninfo></ref> \n\nThe crops were suffering from drought and were highly sensitive to the subsurface presence of stones, bricks or compacted soil. They were in different stages of ripening due to differences in the amount of water in the soil. This created lighter crop marks which indicated stonework and revealed the outlines of buildings at least 40 cm below the surface. Darker marks indicated depressed features such as ditches and canals. To the south of the town centre there was a wide strip of riper crops which were growing above what used to be a canal. The survey covered an area of 100 [[hectares]].<ref>[https://rogueclassicism.com/2009/07/31/lost-city-of-altinum-found/ Excerpts from a Times article]</ref>\n\nThe map of the town was reconstructed in great detail, revealing the urban fabric and the waterways, the town walls and gates, the street network and previously unknown neighbourhoods and buildings, including monumental ones: the [[amphitheatre]], the [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], the [[Odeon (building)|odeon]],  and the [[Roman Forum|forum]], which are attributable to the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. The town was on top of a 2- to 3 m-high mound and in Roman times the lagoon shore probably reached the foot that mound. Altinum was probably partially surrounded by water. The researchers conclude that the results indicate a complex urban system \"adapted to the peculiarity of the lagoon environment\" and show that \"the Romans successfully exploited the amphibious environment several centuries before the city of Venice started to emerge.\" <ref name = Ninfo>[https://www.academia.edu/7738838/The_Map_of_Altinum_Ancestor_of_Venice Ninfo A., Fontana., Mozzi P, Ferrarese F., The Map of Altinum, Ancestor of Venice, Science, Vol 325, 31 July 2009, pp. 577-62]</ref> \n\nThe map of Altinum which was reconstructed through remote sensing can be seen overlaid on Google Earth.<ref>[http://www.ogleearth.com/2009/08/altinum_reveale.html Google Earth]</ref>\n\nThe political and administrative heart of the town was in the northernmost part. Here, besides the outlines of the forum, amphitheatre, theatre and odeon, the outlines of the capitolium (the temple of the [[Capitoline Triad]]) and the [[basilica]] were also identified in the 2007 remote sensing survey. The theatre had a length of 120 m and a radius of 60 m. It is dated between 40 and 20 BCE. It was one of the first ones in northern Italy and one of the first in a provincial town in the whole of Italy. The odeon was half its size. The amphitheatre was in the outskirts, to the north of the canal which marked the northern limit of the town. Its longer axis was 150 m and its size was similar to that of the [[Arena di Verona]] (which could host 30,000 people) and was larger than those of Padua and Aquileia.<ref name =parco/> \n\nBetween 2012 and 2015 [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]] carried out surveys in an area in the east of the town, where a 2000 a [[geophysical]] survey indicated an urban area, roads and a building with an [[apse]] which correspond to the area of the late [[Roman Republic| Republic]] monumental town gate. In the 2007 survey it came out blurred. Between 1989 and 1990 there was a [[geophysical]] survey in this area and the one next to it to the east. A series of [[plinths]] along the main canal and a secondary canal which branches from it were identified. This tallies with some 1972 samplings on the eastern bank of the secondary canal which found the foundations of a brick quay resting on wooden piling and seven rectangular plinths related to a big building which is identified as a warehouse. This suggests that it was a commercial area.<ref name = Cipriano>[https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/books/978-88-6969-189-8/978-88-6969-189-8-ch-05.pdf Cipriano S., Il progetto Altino 2012-2015: il survey  in localit\u00e0 Ghiacciaia, in Sperti L, Silvia Cipriano S.,  Monica Pagan M., in Ricerche e studi ad Altino e nei Musei archeologici del Veneto,Giornata dell\u2019archeologia: scavi e ricerche del Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Universit\u00e0 Ca' Foscari, 2016, pp.74-79]</ref>\n\nIn 2012 just under half of the area was surveyed. It focused on surface finds (at a depth of 20-30 cm). The area ad been devoted to medicinal plants for years and had not been ploughed. It was on a marked mound. Pottery and architectural  fragments, coins, fictile materials and other items were found. High concentrations of plaster, mosaic [[tesserae]] and architectural and stone fragments indicate that there were buildings. The 2014 campaign covered the rest of the area and used the same methods. Electromagnetic prospections detected three northeast\u2013southwest parallel gravel roads with an average length of c. 7 m and a road perpendicular to them along the northern edge of the area, which was parallel to the canal which marks the northern end of the town. Another structure with the same orientation was detected in central area of the survey, but gravel was not detected and it might have been a canal.<ref name = Cipriano></ref> \n\nThe finds of some concentrations of glass leftovers and fragments of a [[crucible]] suggest that there were glassworks. This is an important find because it could confirm the hypothesis that Altinum had a role in glass production in the Roman days.<ref name = Cipriano></ref>\n\n==The port and the canals==\nThe networks of ditches and canals discovered to the northwest, southwest and south of Altinum, the canals in the town and the canals which connected the town to the lagoon show that Altinum needed to both connect its port to the lagoon and to create a hydraulic system to manage the delicate hydraulic and environmental setting of the marshy area it was in. This shaped the [[geomorphology]] of the town. Vitruvius gave some indication of the management needs in marshy areas, including Altinum, and Strabo indicated that the town had a system of canals (see above). Altinum was successful in managing its often waterlogged marshy environment. \n\nAltinum was crossed in the middle by a west\u2013east main canal. An oblong semi-circular canal marked the northern limit of the central part of the town and a southern one marked the southern limit. These three canals reached the River Zero, to the west of the town. The Siloncello canal, which still exists, run in a northeast\u2013southwest oblique straight line form the River [[Sile]]. It came close to the north-eastern edge of the town. A southward extension of this canal was connected to the three mentioned canals. It continued to south of the town and reached the Santa Maria canal, which still exists and runs south of the town from the River Dese to the lagoon at the Palude di Cona marsh and thus connected the port, which was to the east of the extension canal, to the lagoon. The Siloncello canal turns east at a right angle just before the town and then south, reaching the Palude di Cona slightly further east. Thus, the port could be reached through the Siloncello form the east and the Santa Maria form the west.<ref name =Porto>[https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/15810/1/17-Tirelli_295-316.pdf Tirelli M., Il Porto di Altino]</ref>\n\nThe Siloncello canal also continued eastwards and reached the River Sile, close to its mouth. At the time the River [[Piave (river)|Piave]] must have flowed into the Sile. The Piave was a preferred route for the transport of wood from the forests of [[Cadore]] towards Altinum as attested by an inscription found in [[Feltre]]. Thus, this canal was of strategic importance for the supply of wood. The remains of a 192 m long mooring dock on the western bank of the Siloncello was found in 1930 a few hundreds of metres north of the town.<ref name =Porto></ref>\n\nA fluvial dock area found between 1988 and 1993 on the west bank of a north\u2013south canal that was aligned to the Siloncello canal. It had porticoed warehouses. The dock and the canal bed were below the urban structures of the Augustan period urban period. In this period the canal was filled in.<ref name =Porto></ref>\n\nA monumental town gate was built following the model of urban gates with a central body and angular towers. It has been dated to the first half of the 1st century BCE. It was richly decorated. The central body with the gate had two towers at each side. The structure was flanked on both sides by two short wall tracts attached to the towers. It rested on strong pilings made with oak trunks. It was on the canal that marked the northern boundary of the town. The canal was crossed, perhaps through two arches, by the [[cardus maximus]]. This canal is now only a ditch. It was shown in a 16th-century map. It still had a considerable width, was visible and reached the River Zero in the late 19th century. It was the preferred route to take goods from the port to some presumed moorings at the northern border of the town and to the beginning of the Via Claudia Augusta.<ref name =Porto></ref>  \n\nIn 1972 the foundation of a 16.3 m brick dock with fully curved arches linked to a large building were found close to the gate, on the eastern bank of a secondary canal which branched off the main one inside the urban area. Its materials are dated to the late 1st century BCE and the mid-1st century CE. The remains of an imposing complex of porticoed docks was found along the opposite bank of the canal in an electromagnetic survey. The results indicate that it stretched for an over 120 m angled course which seems to faithfully follow the morphology of the canal, whose width was around 10 m.<ref name =Porto></ref>\n\nThe foundations of another porticoed dock similarly linked to a large building were detected along the canal which marked the southern border of the town, whose bed was indicated by a considerable depression in the terrain in the mid-60s. It stretched eastwards immediately before the northern shoulder of the bridge which linked the [[Via Annia]] to the town. It is dated to the late Republic period. It was in a key position in the immediate vicinity of the southern entrance of the town and along a fluvial a route which started from the port and must have gone through the Santa Maria canal. This canal was connected to it. It was also liked to the Via Annia. From here goods could reach the inland markets overland via the Via Annia or by following a wide canal with wooden banks which flanked this road in the north.<ref name =Porto></ref> \n\n==UNESCO World Heritage Site==\nThe \"Venice and her Lagoon\" [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] was established in 1987.

The line is part of the Cardiff urban rail network, known as the [[Valley Lines]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe line is historically the [[Taff Vale Railway]], the first rail development in the [[South Wales Valleys|Valleys]] in the 1840s and associated with the notorious [[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants|Taff Vale Judgment]] in 1901 when the courts penalised trade unions for losses caused by strikes.\n\nThe Aberdare line was closed in the 1960s under the [[Beeching Axe]].
