The 18th century saw upheaval in Jalandhar amidst an anarchy caused by the disintegration of the Mughals and power struggles involving [[Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire|Persians]], [[Durrani Empire|Afghans]] and [[Sikhs]]. It was captured by the [[Singhpuria Misl|Faizullahpuria Misl]] in 1766, and in 1811 [[Ranjit Singh]] incorporated it within the [[Sikh Empire]].<ref>Parminder Singh Grover Moga, Davinderjit Singh, Discover Punjab: Attractions of Punjab, Parminder Singh Grover, 20 May 2011</ref> \n\nIn 1849, following the annexation of the Punjab by the [[East India Company]], the city of Jalandhar, now spelt ''Jullundur'', became the headquarters of the Division and [[Jalandhar district|District]] of the same name. In the mid 19th century, British officials regarded Jalandhar as densely populated and farmed to capacity. This led to the district being a chief recruitment area for settlers to colonise the newly irrigated [[Punjab Canal Colonies]] in western Punjab.<ref>Tom G. Kessinger, University of California, Berkeley.

The election used the twelve [[ward (politics)|wards]] created as a result of the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]], with each ward electing three or four councillors using the [[single transferable vote]] system a form of [[proportional representation]], with 43 councillors being elected, a reduction of 4 members and 1 ward since 2012.\n\nFollowing the election the Conservative Party became the largest party, with Labour falling from first place into third place in terms of votes and seats. The SNP also drew with Labour in terms of seats as they both won 11 seats.\n\nThis election also saw Independent councillors Willie Scobie and Jane Maitland returned, but saw Marion McCutcheon, George Prentice, Tom McAughtrie, Yen Hongmei Jin, Denis Male and Craig Peacock all losing their seats. [[Elaine Murray]], the former MSP for [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]] was elected to the Council in the Nith ward.\n\nFollowing the election, Ian Carruthers (Annandale South) was elected as the Conservative group leader, Rob Davidson (Abbey) as the SNP group leader and Elaine Murray (Nith) as the Labour group leader. Richard Brodie (Annandale South), is the sole Liberal Democrat councillor.\n\nOn 23 May, almost three weeks following the election, Labour and the SNP formed a coalition to form a majority council with [[Elaine Murray]] as council leader and Rob Davidson as depute leader and civic head. Although the Conservatives were elected the largest party with 16 seats, they remain in opposition.\n\n==Election result==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Dumfries and Galloway Local Election Result 2017}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 16\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +2\n  |seats %    = 37.21\n  |votes %    = 38.70\n  |votes      = 21,138\n  |plus/minus = +12.09\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      =  Scottish National Party \n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 25.58\n  |votes %    = 21.56\n  |votes      = 11,779\n  |plus/minus = +2.10\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 4\n  |net        = -4\n  |seats %    = 25.58\n  |votes %    = 18.45\n  |votes      = 10,077\n  |plus/minus = -10.89\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 4\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 3\n  |net        = -3\n  |seats %    = 9.30\n  |votes %    = 17.26\n  |votes      = 9,425\n  |plus/minus = -0.80\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 2.33\n  |votes %    = 2.47\n  |votes      = 1,350\n  |plus/minus = -1.48\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Green Party\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 0.00\n  |votes %    = 1.87\n  |votes      = 1,026\n  |plus/minus = +0.03\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Libertarian Party \n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 0.00\n  |votes %    = 0.22\n  |votes      = 118\n  |plus/minus = +0.22\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.

The SNP also drew with Labour in terms of seats as they both won 11 seats.\n\nThis election also saw Independent councillors Willie Scobie and Jane Maitland returned, but saw Marion McCutcheon, George Prentice, Tom McAughtrie, Yen Hongmei Jin, Denis Male and Craig Peacock all losing their seats. [[Elaine Murray]], the former MSP for [[Dumfriesshire (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dumfriesshire]] was elected to the Council in the Nith ward.\n\nFollowing the election, Ian Carruthers (Annandale South) was elected as the Conservative group leader, Rob Davidson (Abbey) as the SNP group leader and Elaine Murray (Nith) as the Labour group leader. Richard Brodie (Annandale South), is the sole Liberal Democrat councillor.\n\nOn 23 May, almost three weeks following the election, Labour and the SNP formed a coalition to form a majority council with [[Elaine Murray]] as council leader and Rob Davidson as depute leader and civic head. Although the Conservatives were elected the largest party with 16 seats, they remain in opposition.\n\n==Election result==\n\n{{Election Summary Begin|title = Dumfries and Galloway Local Election Result 2017}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party\n  |seats      = 16\n  |gain       = 2\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +2\n  |seats %    = 37.21\n  |votes %    = 38.70\n  |votes      = 21,138\n  |plus/minus = +12.09\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      =  Scottish National Party \n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 1\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = +1\n  |seats %    = 25.58\n  |votes %    = 21.56\n  |votes      = 11,779\n  |plus/minus = +2.10\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Labour Party\n  |seats      = 11\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 4\n  |net        = -4\n  |seats %    = 25.58\n  |votes %    = 18.45\n  |votes      = 10,077\n  |plus/minus = -10.89\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Independent (politician)\n  |seats      = 4\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 3\n  |net        = -3\n  |seats %    = 9.30\n  |votes %    = 17.26\n  |votes      = 9,425\n  |plus/minus = -0.80\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Liberal Democrats\n  |seats      = 1\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 2.33\n  |votes %    = 2.47\n  |votes      = 1,350\n  |plus/minus = -1.48\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Green Party\n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 0.00\n  |votes %    = 1.87\n  |votes      = 1,026\n  |plus/minus = +0.03\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party|\n  |party      = Scottish Libertarian Party \n  |seats      = 0\n  |gain       = 0\n  |loss       = 0\n  |net        = 0\n  |seats %    = 0.00\n  |votes %    = 0.22\n  |votes      = 118\n  |plus/minus = +0.22\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n<small>'''Note:''' \"Votes\" are the first preference votes.
