It used to carry the additional sobriquet '''al Tedesco''' (\"to the German\") to distinguish it from the convent of [[San Miniato al Monte]] in [[Florence]], which is about {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the northeast.\n\n==History==\nIn medieval times, San Miniato was on the [[via Francigena]], which was the main connecting route between northern Europe and [[Rome]].  It also sits at the intersection of the [[Florence]]-[[Pisa]] and the [[Lucca]]-[[Siena]] roads.  Over the centuries San Miniato was therefore exposed to a constant flow of friendly and hostile armies, traders in all manner of goods and services, and other travelers from near and far.\n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that the site of the city and surrounding area has been settled since at least the [[paleolithic]] era.  It would have been well known to the [[Etruscans]],  and certainly to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], for whom it was a military post called \"Quarto\".\n\nThe first mention in historical documents is of a small village organized around a chapel dedicated to San Miniato built by the [[Lombards]] in 783.  By the end of the 10th century San Miniato boasted a sizeable population enclosed behind a moat and protected by a castle built by [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]]. In 1116, the new imperial vicar for Tuscany, [[Rabodo]], established himself at San Miniato, supplanting [[Florence]] as the centre of government. The site came to be known as ''al Tedesco'', since the imperial vicars, mostly German, ruled Tuscany from there until the 13th century.\n\nThe first walls, with defensive towers, were thrown up in the 12th century during the time that Italy was dominated by [[Frederick Barbarossa]].  Under his grandson, [[Fredrick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the town was further fortified with expanded walls and other defensive works, including the Rocca and its tower.\n\nDuring the latter years of the 13th century and the entire 14th century, San Miniato was drawn into the ongoing conflict between the [[Ghibelline]] and [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] forces.  Initially Ghibelline, it had become a Guelph city by 1291, allied with Florence and, in 1307, fought with other members of the Guelph league against the Ghibelline [[Arezzo]].\n\nBy 1347 San Miniato was under Florentine control, where it remained, but for a brief period from 1367-1370 when, instigated by Pisa, it rebelled against Florence, and for another brief period between 1777 and 1779 during the Napoleonic conquest.  It was still part of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] when the Duchy was absorbed into the newly formed [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1860.\n\n==Main sights==\nThe city is enclosed within a well-preserved medieval precinct.  Main landmarks include:\n* The Tower of Frederick II, built by Frederick II in the 13th century on the summit of the hill at an elevation of {{convert|192|m|ft}}, overlooking the entire Valdarno. Here was imprisoned his chancellor [[Pier delle Vigne]] until he committed suicide. During [[World War II]] it was destroyed by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] to prevent the Allies from using it as a gun sighting tower, but was reconstructed in 1958 by architect Renato Baldi.\n* The ''Duomo'' (Cathedral), dedicated to both Sant'Assunta and Santo Genesio or [[Saint Genesius of Rome]]. It was originally a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building, but it has been remodelled several times and exhibits [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] and some [[Renaissance]] architectural elements.  The fa\u00e7ade incorporates a number of colorful [[Maiolica|majolica]] bowls.  The interior has Latin cross plan with a central nave with two side aisles.  The cathedral's campanile, a fortification annexed in is called the Matilde Tower and features an asymmetrical clock.\n* The Diocesan Museum, next to the cathedral. This museum-gallery  contains works by [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Jacopo Chimenti]], [[Neri di Bicci]], [[Fra Bartolomeo]], Frederico Cardi (known as [[Cigoli]]) and [[Verrocchio]].\n* ''Palazzo dei Vicari'', built by Emperor [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] during the 12th century, the palazzo incorporates one of the oldest known crenellated turrets. The interior has a number of interesting frescoes.  It is now an hotel.\n* ''Palazzo Comunale''. This 14th-century building is still San Miniato's  Town Hall.  Its great hall was decorated by [[Cenno di Francesco Cenni]]. It also features a small oratory, containing a 16th-century altarpiece.\n* The church of ''San Francesco''. Originally built in the early 13th century with a Romanesque fa\u00e7ade, its interior features Gothic style chapels and frescoes from the 14th and 15th centuries.\n* The church of ''San Domenico'' was originally constructed in the 14th century, but has an incomplete fa\u00e7ade.  Its interior contains [[terracotta]] works by [[Luca della Robbia]], a fresco attributed to [[Masolino da Panicale]] and a burial monument sculpted by [[Donatello]]. Next to the fa\u00e7ade begins the ''Via Angelica'', a tunnel that connected the countryside to the city.\n* Convent of ''San Francesco''. Purportedly founded by [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] himself in 1211 when he visited the city, the Convent stands behind the city higher up on the hill.\n\nOther buildings and monuments worth seeing include the Bishop's Sanctuary, with a [[Baroque]] fa\u00e7ade in the design of an amphitheater, designed by Cigoli and the Sanctuary of the Crucifix, recently restored, the desanctified Chiesa di San Martino, which has done duty as a convent, and then a prison, but which will now be used for conventions.\n\nThere are also a number of Renaissance palazzi, built by such aristocratic families as the Roffia, Grifoni, Formichini and the Bonapartes, ancestors of [[Napoleon]].\n\n==White truffles==\nDuring the last three weeks of November, [http://ladyvoyage.com/2013/11/08/truffles-fair-in-san-miniato-paradise-of-free-gourmet-food-tastings/ San Miniato hosts a festival devoted to the gastronomically precious white truffle] which is harvested in the area around the city.  The white truffle is more highly valued than the black truffles found in [[Umbria]] and the [[Marche]], and commands very high prices, reflected in the cost of restaurant dishes that incorporate truffles.  In 1954 a record-breaking truffle found close to the nearby village of Balconevisi weighed in at {{convert|2520|g|lb}} and was sent to the United States of America as a gift for President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].\n\nCurrent (2019) prices for white truffle in the town are 2500 euros per kilo for first quality and 1800 euros per kilo for second quality.\n\n==Twin Towns==\n* {{flagicon|BFA}} [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]\n* {{flagicon|BEL}} [[Silly, Belgium|Silly]], [[Belgium]]\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} [[Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon]], [[France]]\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n\n===''Frazioni''===\n[[Balconevisi]], [[Bucciano, San Miniato|Bucciano]], [[Catena, San Miniato|Catena]], [[Cigoli, San Miniato|Cigoli]], [[Corazzano]], [[Cusignano]], [[Isola, San Miniato|Isola]], [[La Scala, San Miniato|La Scala]], [[La Serra, San Miniato|La Serra]], [[Molino d'Egola]], [[Moriolo]], [[Ponte a Egola]], [[Ponte a Elsa]], [[Roffia]], [[San Donato, San Miniato|San Donato]], [[San Miniato Basso]], [[San Romano, Pisa|San Romano]], [[Stibbio]].\n\n===''Localit\u00e0''===\nBorghigiana, Calenzano, Campriano, Canneto, Canuto, Casastrada, Collebrunacchi, Dogaia, Genovini, Marzana, Montebicchieri, Palagio, Parrino, San Quintino, Sant'Angelo a Montorzo, Volpaio.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Interior, church of San Domenico, San Miniato.jpg|thumb|Interior, church of San Domenico, San Miniato]]\nSan Miniato has a railway station on the [[Leopolda railway|Pisa-Florence line]].
