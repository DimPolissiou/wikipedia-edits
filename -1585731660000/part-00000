Before changing its profile to fully focus on these aspects, it used to be a regular German public Gymnasium with a special separate school section ''(Spezialschulteil)'' attached to it. The school is named after the famous optician [[Carl Zeiss]] and is located in the city of [[Jena]] in Germany ''(federal state of [[Thuringia]])''. They accept students from all over the federal state.\n\n== Pupils ==\n\nCurrently there are about 500 students attending this school. But not all of those are enrolled in the special educational program. This program is restricted to [[highly gifted]] students. Hence, there are certain requirements for an individual to be able to obtain a place at this school, including qualification exams and other background checks like grades and awards accomplished by the prospective student mostly at the former school.\n\nIn the early phases of the school students got to go from 9th grade onto the special section of the school (usually two new groups [classes] accepted per year). The year before is severe because this is when the exams take place and the school decides about their new students for the upcoming year. Later on it was also possible for kids to attend the school from 5th grade on.\n\nHowever, students starting 5th grade also had to take an exam, which didn't guarantee that they would pass the exam for 9th grade because they had to take this exam as well as everybody else (albeit they have a slight advantage by having been educated longer on a higher level).\n\nAnyway, 5th grade students do not have the possibility to stay at the boarding school. The boarding school, established in 2000,<ref>{{Cite web | title =10 Years VACOM Internat of Carl Zeiss- Gymnasium Jena, 23 April 2010 | work =VACOM News - Company News | publisher =VACOM Vakuum Komponenten & Messtechnik GmbH | date =23 April 2010 | url =http://www.vacom-vacuum.com/1/1/firmenneuigkeiten.php | accessdate =8 November 2010 }}</ref> is separate and privately maintained. It offers a possibility for students from 9th (to 12th) grade to live close to the school. Fees for this boarding school are subsidized by the federal state. Even though this is a good opportunity there are very few places being offered.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Forming ===\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium formed after the [[German reunification]] by affiliating the ''Polytechnische Oberschule \"Clara Zetkin\"'' (polytechnic grammar school \"Clara Zetking\"), which was founded in 1963, and the ''Spezialschule mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlich-technischer Richtung \"Carl Zeiss\"'' (special school with mathematical and natural scientific orientation). This process first yielded a normal Gymnasium ''(Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium)'' and in addition a special section ''(Spezialschulteil)''. This particular part of the school has been accessible for students from 9th grade onwards. Since the educational system of federal state of [[Thuringia]] didn't provide to maintain a school as only being a ''Spezialschule'' (special school) it was necessary to connect it with a regular Gymnasium.\n\n=== Support ===\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' has especially been supported by the [[Carl-Zeiss company|Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung]] that is also located in [[Jena]]. During the times of the [[German Democratic Republic]] a lot of students were recruited by the company and found themselves becoming engineers or in leadership positions after their graduation. Programs during the school times helped the students to get an orientation for their later profession. Even today there is a more or less close connection between the school and the enterprise with the same name. For instance, funding for good achievements of students are often given out by the company to support the school.\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\nThe school often receives good funding by the federal state and is therefore very well-equipped compared to other Gymnasiums in the region. The technical sections of the school meet high standards and can be considered pretty modern in terms of education.\n\nThe special school section used to be in a separate building from the regular one. But after the main building got renovated in the years from 2003 to 2005 the special school moved in this building, too. After their abandoning the old building is now used by an elementary school.\n\n=== Perspective ===\n\nBy 2008 the school is supposed to be completely transformed into a mere ''Spezialschule'' (literal translation: special school) since this school has been running as a trial so far. Then the program will run for students officially from 5th grade on.\n\nThereby, the position of the ''\"Leiter der Spezialklassen\"'' (\"Guidance of the special classes\") would not be needed anymore because the leading of the school is currently separate. This office had been held for a long time by ''R\u00fcdiger Eisenbrand'' who quit his official school service. He is now mayor of the city of [[Apolda]]. If he will return to any office at the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is not sure yet.\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\n=== Syllabus and Appearance ===\n\nThe curriculum of the ''Spezialschule'' (special school) differs tremendously from those in regular Gymnasiums in [[Thuringia]]. The coverage is, as mentioned earlier above, mainly in the fields mathematics and natural science and goes very deep into the topics. Therefore, there is an abundance of classes related to these topics and lot of periods to be taken by the students. But since students are very into their subjects discussion in class are sometimes very intens and are appreciated with high interest by the students even if arguing sometimes runs riot. Classes are kept very small, often from 14-20 students maximum, and are also pretty often separated again (for certain scientific subjects) so that a group of 6-8 people yields a very good learning result.\n\nStudents learn informatics related subjects already in 10th and 9th grade, which is not usual.\n\n=== Projects ===\n\nIn 11th and 12th grade when the ''Kurssystem'' (course system) applies for the students they have to take [[mathematics]] as their major field of study. As the second major field of study they can choose between informatics (what is not usual offered), chemistry, biology or physics.\n\nThe ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper) - a big project work during 11th grade - has to be written about a mathematical or scientific topic only.\n\n9th grade students have to write their first project paper on a topic of their choice - the only restriction is that it has to be scientific. This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=November 2010}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2010}}\n{{original research|date=September 2007}}\n{{Copy edit|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n|name                   = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena\n|native_name            =\n|latin_name             =\n|logo                   =\n|seal_image             =\n|image                  = Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena.jpg\n|image_size             =\n|alt                    =\n|caption                =\n|motto                  =\n|motto_translation      =\n|location               =\n|streetaddress          = Erich-Kuithan-Str. 7\n|region                 =\n|city                   = [[Jena]]\n|state                  = [[Thuringia]]\n|province               =\n|county                 =\n|postcode               =\n|postalcode             =\n|zipcode                =\n|country                = Germany\n|country1               =\n|coordinates            = {{Coord|50|57|08|N|11|36|33|E|region:DE_type:edu_source:dewiki|display=inline,title}}\n|schooltype             =\n|fundingtype            =\n|type                   = German elite [[Gymnasium school|''Gymnasium'']] for maths, science, and technology\n|religious_affiliation  =\n|religion               =\n|denomination           =\n|patron                 =\n|established            = 1963\n|founded                =\n|opened                 =\n|founder                =\n|status                 =\n|closed                 =\n|locale                 =\n|schoolboard            =\n|district               =\n|LEA                    =\n|authority              =\n|category               =\n|category_label         =\n|oversight              =\n|oversight_label        =\n|authorizer             =\n|superintendent         =\n|trustee                =\n|specialist             =\n|session                =\n|schoolnumber           =\n|school code            =\n|MOE                    =\n|ofsted                 =\n|ceeb                   =\n|president              =\n|chair                  =\n|chairman               =\n|chairperson            =\n|dean                   =\n|administrator          =\n|rector                 =\n|director               =\n|principal              = Dr. Carsten M\u00fcller\n|principal_label        =\n|principal1             =\n|principal2             =\n|principal3             =\n|principal4             =\n|viceprincipal          =\n|viceprincipal_label    =\n|viceprincipal1         =\n|viceprincipal2         =\n|viceprincipal3         =\n|viceprincipal4         =\n|asst principal         =\n|assistant_principals   =\n|campus director        =\n|headmistress           =\n|headmaster             =\n|head of school         =\n|head_teacher           =\n|executive_headteacher  =\n|acting_headteacher     =\n|head                   =\n|head_label             =\n|chaplain               =\n|custodian              =\n|staff                  =\n|faculty                =\n|teaching_staff         =\n|employees              =\n|key_people             =\n|grades                 =\n|years                  =\n|gender                 = [[Coeducational]]\n|lower_age              =\n|upper_age              =\n|age range              =\n|enrollment              = ca. 500\n|website                = {{URL|http://carl-zeiss-gymnasium.de/}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena''' is a state-funded German elite [[Gymnasium school|Gymnasium]] ''(grammar school)'' for highly gifted students in the fields of math, science, and technology.

This is very unusual to start off already in this early grade with such a relatively big project.\n\nIt continues in 10th grade when students get to write the ''Informatikprojekt'' (informatics project) where students (mostly in small groups) have to write a program as well as a documentation paper in which they describe their problem sets, used solutions, algorithm, and problems that occurred on their way. At the end there is a presentation to be prepared and hold in front of a judging auditorium.\n\n=== Wahlobligatorischer Unterricht (selective compulsory curriculum) ===\n\nSince the curriculum of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is highly mathematical and scientifically oriented it offers advanced educational sessions for the student body. Starting from 9th grade every student gets to choose one deeper subject of study of his interest in the fields of math, physics, biology, chemistry or informatics. Now, two extra periods a week are dedicated to this particular field only. Unlike normal subject tutors of the ''wahlobligatorischer Unterricht'' do not proceed grading of students for those extra sessions. This often provides the opportunity for students as well as for teachers to take the matters of studies more airy and to deepen certain aspects of concern on behalf of special interest areas.\n\n=== Graduation ===\n\nThe [[Abitur|''Abitur'' (German high school diploma)]] can be taken in a slightly modified form in a so-called \"special version\" that has been fitted for a particular high requirement even though the German ''[[Abitur]]'' is compared to the diploma of the United States already pretty hard. But there is still the possibility to culminate the 'special school section' by taking the regular \"central Abitur\" for the federal state of [[Thuringia]].\n\n== Reputation ==\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium is especially famous for the success of its students in several academic competitions on a national and an international level. Tournaments e. g. are the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]], the ''Bundeswettbewerb Informatik'' (federal informatics contest), the [[International Chemistry Olympiad]] or the [[International Biology Olympiad]].\n\nOn some occasions the school also gets to host some of those competitions mentioned above.\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe [[University of Jena|Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (FSU)]] offers a possibility for the school to catch up with science just in their own town. Furthermore, a lot of students enjoy the opportunity of the convenience to visit professors and doctors of the numerous faculties of the university, which are scattered all over the town. Students can especially gain knowledge by getting help with their scientific projects and works assigned at school (bigger project like the ''Seminarfacharbeit'' (seminar paper).\n\nA lot of students will take their chance and attain the university after they graduated from school and continue their studies in [[Jena]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cz-gymnasium.jena.de Homepage of the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060918230836/http://internat.vacom.de/ Homepage of the boarding school]\n* [http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2007/01/21/biz/878071.html An article in the newspaper \"Berliner Morgenpost\" about the school (in German)]\n\n[[Category:Gymnasiums in Germany]]\n[[Category:Specialist schools in Germany]]\n[[Category:Schools in Thuringia]]\n[[Category:Education in Jena]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jena]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1963]]\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Samaniran", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copy editing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium_Jena"}

Is located near the ancient Dacian fortress [[Dacidava]].\n\nThree villages are administered by the town: Bic (''B\u00fckk''), Cehei (''Somly\u00f3csehi'') and Pusta (''Csehipuszta'').\n\n== History ==\n=== Ancient times ===\n{{See also|Dacians|Dacia}}\n[[File:Goldkette mit 52 Anh\u00e4ngern.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gepid gold necklace with 52 pendants discovered at \u0218imleu, now exhibited at [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Sinagoga din \u015eimleu Silvaniei.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum]]]]\nBefore the Roman conquest of [[Dacia]], \u0218imleu was a political, social and administrative [[Dacians|Dacian]] centre, of high importance.{{sfn|Wanner|2010|p=102}} Seven [[Dacian fortresses]], some with associated settlements, were arranged in an arc shape around the hills of \u0218imleu.{{sfn|Wanner|2010|pp=89-90}} They had a strategic role in the supervising the trade along the [[salt road]] coming from areas around [[Napoca (ancient city)|Napoca]], [[Potaissa]] and modern [[Dej]], and heading to [[Pannonia]].{{sfn|Wanner|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Wanner|2010|p=90}}\n\nThe centre of an early ''[[Gepidia]]'', on the plains northwest of the [[Mese\u0219 Mountains]], appears to have been located around \u0218imleu Silvaniei, where early 5th-century precious objects of Roman provenance have been unearthed.{{sfn|B\u0103rbulescu|2005|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|B\u00f3na|1994|p=77}}\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{Main|Transylvania in the Early Middle Ages|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Origin of the Romanians}}\n[[File:Bathory Castle2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[\u0218imleu Silvaniei Fort]] built by the [[B\u00e1thory family]]]]\nIn 1258 it was mentioned as ''Wathasomlyowa.'' The name means \"Wata's mountain\"; the name Wata is of Old Turkish origin, while ''somlyowa'' is an archaic Hungarian word for mountain(side).\n\nThe town belonged to the [[B\u00e1thory family]], whose ancestral castle stood here. The castle was built by [[Mikl\u00f3s B\u00e1thory|Mikl\u00f3s]], voivode of Transylvania in the early 13th century and was first mentioned in 1319. After the B\u00e1thory family built a mansion in the town in 1592, the castle became deserted and today lies in ruins.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Catholic Church]] was built in 1534 by Transylvania's voivode [[B\u00e1thory Istv\u00e1n]] and his wife Telegdy Katalin with the occasion of their son's birth. [[Holy Trinity Statue, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Holy Trinity Statue]] was built in 1772. [[Reformed Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Reformed Church]] was rebuilt between 1729 and 1736. The [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum|synagogue]] was built in 1876.\n\nThe [[\u015eimleu Silvaniei Fort|mansion]] was occupied by [[Giorgio Basta]] from [[Zsigmond B\u00e1thory]] in 1600. It was occupied by the [[Ottomans]] in 1660 and was part of [[Varat Eyalet]] until 1692. In 1703 it was occupied by [[Kurucs]].\n\nFrom 1876 to 1920, \u0218imleu Silvaniei was part of the [[Szil\u00e1gy County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThe [[Greek Catholic]] Vicariate of \u0218imleu Silvaniei was formed in 1910 and in 1817 the vicariate opened its own school. George Tatu (1810-1824), Georgiu Abraham (1824-1828), Isidor Alpini (1828-1835), [[Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu]] (1836-1850), Demetriu Coroianu (1850-1873), [[Alimpiu Barboloviciu]] (1873-1914), Alexandru Ghetie (1914-1922), Emil Bran (1926-1932), Petru Cupcea (1932-1940), Cornel Darabant (1940-1945), Gheorghe \u021aurca\u0219 (2004-2009) served as vicars of \u0218imleu Silvaniei. The old Greek Catholic church was destroyed by a storm in 1866. [[Notre Dame Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Notre Dame Church]] was built between 1871 and 1873.<ref>[http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&idart=355 Scurt istoric al Vicariatului Silvaniei]</ref>\n\nIn 1919, [[Simion B\u0103rnutiu Na\u021bional College]], the first [[Romanian language]] high school in [[S\u0103laj County]] was founded here, and today the town is home to three high schools.\n\nIn 1940, \u0218imleu Silvaniei, along with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]], was given to Hungary through the [[Second Vienna Award]] imposed by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]]; Romania regained the area in 1944.\n\nSince 1997, inside [[Bic Monastery]], there is the wooden church from [[St\u00e2na, S\u0103laj|St\u00e2na]]; built in 1778 it has a rectangular plan with nave and pronave.<ref>[http://www.welcometoromania.ro/DN1h/DN1h_Simleu_Silvaniei_e.htm \u0218imleu Silvaniei]</ref>\n\n==Holocaust==\n{{Main|Cehei ghetto}}\nThe Cehei ghetto operated within the town's administrative area. The ghetto was one of the Nazi-era ghettos for European Jews during World War II. It was active in the spring of 1944, following [[Operation Margarethe]]. The deportations from Cehei took place in three transports: May 31 (3,106), June 3 (3,161) and June 6 (1,584), with a total of 7,851 Jews sent to [[Auschwitz]]. Some 1,200 S\u0103laj Jews survived the Holocaust but later emigrated from Romania, so that by the 2000s, under fifty Jews remained in the county.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1910 |6885\n|1930 |7448\n|1948 |7931\n|1956 |8560\n|1966 |12324\n|1977 |14575\n|1992 |17642\n|2002 |17053\n|2011 |13200\n}}\n\nAccording to the last [[Demographics of Romania|census from 2011]] there were 13,200  people living within the city.\n\nOf this population, 66.77% are ethnic [[Romanians]], while 22.87% are ethnic [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], 9.82 ethnic [[Romani people|Romani]] and 0.51% others.<ref>[http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?regiune_id=2140&judet_id=2508&localitate_id=2512 2002 Census]</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n=== 2012 election ===\nThe \u0218imleu Silvaniei Council, elected in the [[2012 Romanian local election|2012 local government election]], is made up of 17 councilors, with the following party composition: 7-[[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]], 4-[[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], 3-[[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]], 2-[[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], and 1-[[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]].<ref>[http://www.magazinsalajean.ro/index.php?cmd=article&artid=33623 Alegerile locale in S\u0103laj, rezultate finale!]</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The name means \"Wata's mountain\"; the name Wata is of Old Turkish origin, while ''somlyowa'' is an archaic Hungarian word for mountain(side).\n\nThe town belonged to the [[B\u00e1thory family]], whose ancestral castle stood here. The castle was built by [[Mikl\u00f3s B\u00e1thory|Mikl\u00f3s]], voivode of Transylvania in the early 13th century and was first mentioned in 1319. After the B\u00e1thory family built a mansion in the town in 1592, the castle became deserted and today lies in ruins.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Catholic Church]] was built in 1534 by Transylvania's voivode [[B\u00e1thory Istv\u00e1n]] and his wife Telegdy Katalin with the occasion of their son's birth. [[Holy Trinity Statue, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Holy Trinity Statue]] was built in 1772. [[Reformed Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Reformed Church]] was rebuilt between 1729 and 1736. The [[Northern Transylvania Holocaust Memorial Museum|synagogue]] was built in 1876.\n\nThe [[\u015eimleu Silvaniei Fort|mansion]] was occupied by [[Giorgio Basta]] from [[Zsigmond B\u00e1thory]] in 1600. It was occupied by the [[Ottomans]] in 1660 and was part of [[Varat Eyalet]] until 1692. In 1703 it was occupied by [[Kurucs]].\n\nFrom 1876 to 1920, \u0218imleu Silvaniei was part of the [[Szil\u00e1gy County]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nThe [[Greek Catholic]] Vicariate of \u0218imleu Silvaniei was formed in 1910 and in 1817 the vicariate opened its own school. George Tatu (1810-1824), Georgiu Abraham (1824-1828), Isidor Alpini (1828-1835), [[Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu]] (1836-1850), Demetriu Coroianu (1850-1873), [[Alimpiu Barboloviciu]] (1873-1914), Alexandru Ghetie (1914-1922), Emil Bran (1926-1932), Petru Cupcea (1932-1940), Cornel Darabant (1940-1945), Gheorghe \u021aurca\u0219 (2004-2009) served as vicars of \u0218imleu Silvaniei. The old Greek Catholic church was destroyed by a storm in 1866. [[Notre Dame Church, \u015eimleu Silvaniei|Notre Dame Church]] was built between 1871 and 1873.<ref>[http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&idart=355 Scurt istoric al Vicariatului Silvaniei]</ref>\n\nIn 1919, [[Simion B\u0103rnutiu Na\u021bional College]], the first [[Romanian language]] high school in [[S\u0103laj County]] was founded here, and today the town is home to three high schools.\n\nIn 1940, \u0218imleu Silvaniei, along with the rest of [[Northern Transylvania]], was given to Hungary through the [[Second Vienna Award]] imposed by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]]; Romania regained the area in 1944.\n\nSince 1997, inside [[Bic Monastery]], there is the wooden church from [[St\u00e2na, S\u0103laj|St\u00e2na]]; built in 1778 it has a rectangular plan with nave and pronave.<ref>[http://www.welcometoromania.ro/DN1h/DN1h_Simleu_Silvaniei_e.htm \u0218imleu Silvaniei]</ref>\n\n==Holocaust==\n{{Main|Cehei ghetto}}\nThe Cehei ghetto operated within the town's administrative area. The ghetto was one of the Nazi-era ghettos for European Jews during World War II. It was active in the spring of 1944, following [[Operation Margarethe]]. The deportations from Cehei took place in three transports: May 31 (3,106), June 3 (3,161) and June 6 (1,584), with a total of 7,851 Jews sent to [[Auschwitz]].

The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited.

In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.\n\n===Afghan Connection===\nDehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], after which the Afghan Emir [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)]] was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Tracing-Doons-Afghan-connect/articleshow/47835111.cms|title=Tracing Doon's Afghan connect - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years.

The present Mangla Devi Inter College, was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun<ref>''Malalai Joan of Arc of Afghanistan and the Victors of Maiwand: The Second Anglo-Afghan War 1878-1882''https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZsuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&dq=afghanistan+dehradun&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAnsnu0ufZAhWP2VMKHZDeCFgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20dehradun&f=false</ref>\n\nThe Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan.

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year. Notable fairs include Magh Mela, held on 14 January and Jhanda Mela in March, a fair for the Hindu community, that attracts Hindus from all over India and abroad.\n\n==Sport==\nThe first indoor ice rink in India that meets the size requirements for [[ice hockey]], [[figure skating]], [[short track speed skating|short track]] and [[rink bandy]] was built in Dehradun.<ref name=IceRink>{{cite web |title=Nation's biggest ice-skating rink draws players from across country |author=Sandeep Rana |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524034007/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket Association of Uttarakhand]] is the governing body of the cricket activities in the Uttarakhand state of India and the [[Uttarakhand cricket team]].

The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|right|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited. He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/may/270512-How-Nehru-spent-his-last-four-days.htm|title=How Nehru spent his last four days|publisher=Mid-day.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> Another leader from the independence movement, [[Rash Behari Bose]], who was one of the key organisers of the [[Ghadar conspiracy]] and, later, the [[Indian National Army]] was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle.\n\nPost independence Dehradun and other parts of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] were merged with [[United Provinces (1937-1950)|United Provinces]] which was later renamed the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.\n\n===Afghan Connection===\nDehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], after which the Afghan Emir [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)]] was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Tracing-Doons-Afghan-connect/articleshow/47835111.cms|title=Tracing Doon's Afghan connect - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years.

The present Mangla Devi Inter College, was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun<ref>''Malalai Joan of Arc of Afghanistan and the Victors of Maiwand: The Second Anglo-Afghan War 1878-1882''https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZsuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&dq=afghanistan+dehradun&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAnsnu0ufZAhWP2VMKHZDeCFgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20dehradun&f=false</ref>\n\nThe Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Balahissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie's [[Wynberg Allen School]].

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year. Notable fairs include Magh Mela, held on 14 January and Jhanda Mela in March, a fair for the Hindu community, that attracts Hindus from all over India and abroad.\n\n==Sport==\nThe first indoor ice rink in India that meets the size requirements for [[ice hockey]], [[figure skating]], [[short track speed skating|short track]] and [[rink bandy]] was built in Dehradun.<ref name=IceRink>{{cite web |title=Nation's biggest ice-skating rink draws players from across country |author=Sandeep Rana |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524034007/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket Association of Uttarakhand]] is the governing body of the cricket activities in the Uttarakhand state of India and the [[Uttarakhand cricket team]].
