The screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] was adapted from Howard Rigsby's 1957 novel ''Sundown at Crazy Horse''.\n\nThe supporting cast features [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Neville Brand]] and [[Jack Elam]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}\nBrendan O'Malley (Douglas) crosses the border into Mexico to escape justice for a murder. He arrives at the ranch of a former lover, Belle Breckenridge (Malone) and her husband, the well-mannered Virginian drunkard and coward John Breckenridge ([[Joseph Cotten]]). Brendan is determined to win back Belle.\n\nO'Malley meets her daughter Melissa ([[Carol Lynley]]). He is immediately attracted to Missy, who reminds him of Belle when they were lovers years ago. Breckenridge, meanwhile, hires O'Malley to drive his herd to [[Texas]]. Bren accepts under condition he is paid bu one fifth of the herd, but also tells Breckenridge he will take his wife once the cattle drive is finished. Breckenridge doesn't take him seriously.\n\nSheriff Dana Stribling (Hudson) is pursuing O'Malley. He arrives at the ranch to serve a warrant for the murder.\n\nStribling does not have jurisdiction to arrest O'Malley in Mexico so he also agrees to join the cattle drive to Texas. He promises to deliver O'Malley to the law upon their arrival. After a several bust-ups between the two, O\u2019Malley finds out that the man he murdered was Stribling's brother-in-law and that his sister hanged herself after the kill.\n\nDuring the cattle drive Breckenridge separates and goes to a bar where he gets drunk. Two former Confederates confront Breckenridge and accuse him of cowardice during a battle in the Civil War. Although Stribling and O'Malley team up to try and save Breckenridge's life, Breckinridge is shot in the back and killed trying to leave the bar. Stribling and O'Malley respond by shooting the man who shot Breckinridge, and then bury Breckinridge back at the cattle drive camp.\n\nAlong the journey, Stribling and Belle become attracted to each other and plan to marry. O'Malley is crushed when he sees them and eventually falls in love with Missy, who convinces him she's not too young for him.\n\nThe group manages to get safely to Texas where Belle begs Stribling not to confront O\u2019Malley. He has mixed feelings but doesn't want to back down. On the eve of the showdown between the two men, Belle discloses the secret that Missy is the daughter of O'Malley and their incestuous love cannot continue. He is stunned but refuses to believe her. He spends the day with Missy and promises to leave with her. At the gunfight, O'Malley faces the sheriff with an unloaded gun, effectively committing suicide.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rock Hudson]] as Dana Stribling\n*[[Kirk Douglas]] as Brendan \"Bren\" O'Malley\n*[[Dorothy Malone]] as Belle Breckenridge\n*[[Joseph Cotten]] as John Breckenridge\n*[[Carol Lynley]] as Melissa \"Missy\" Breckenridge\n*[[Neville Brand]] as Frank Hobbs\n*[[Regis Toomey]] as Milton Wing\n*Rad Fulton as Julesburg Kid\n*[[Adam Williams (actor)|Adam Williams]] as Calverton\n*[[Jack Elam]] as Ed Hobbs\n*John Shay as Bowman\n\n==Production==\nIn 1959 Kirk Douglas announced he had bought the rights to ''Day of the Gun'' by Richard Telfair (the pen name for [[Richard Jessup]]).<ref>STAGE IS A SMASH IN MOVIE CAPITAL: Hollywood Area Has Off-Broadway Flavor With 10 Theatres in Operation By MURRAY SCHUMACHS New York Times ]30 Apr 1959: 36.</ref>\n\nIn December 1959 it was announced Douglas and Rock Hudson would star in ''Day of the Gun'' from the novel by Howard Vechel, filming to begin in Mexico in March.

The screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] was adapted from Howard Rigsby's 1957 novel ''Sundown at Crazy Horse''.\n\nThe supporting cast features [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Carol Lynley]], [[Neville Brand]] and [[Jack Elam]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2010}}\nBrendan O'Malley (Douglas) crosses the border into Mexico to escape justice for a murder. He arrives at the ranch of a former lover, Belle Breckenridge (Malone) and her husband, the well-mannered Virginian drunkard and coward John Breckenridge ([[Joseph Cotten]]). Brendan is determined to win back Belle.\n\nO'Malley meets her daughter Melissa ([[Carol Lynley]]). He is immediately attracted to Missy, who reminds him of Belle when they were lovers years ago. Breckenridge, meanwhile, hires O'Malley to drive his herd to [[Texas]]. Bren accepts under condition he is paid bu one fifth of the herd, but also tells Breckenridge he will take his wife once the cattle drive is finished. Breckenridge doesn\u2019t take him seriously.\n\nSheriff Dana Stribling (Hudson) is pursuing O'Malley. He arrives at the ranch to serve a warrant for the murder.\n\nStribling does not have jurisdiction to arrest O'Malley in Mexico so he also agrees to join the cattle drive to Texas. He promises to deliver O'Malley to the law upon their arrival. After a several bust-ups between the two, O\u2019Malley finds out that the man he murdered was Stribling\u2019s brother-in-law and that his sister hanged herself after the kill.\n\nDuring the cattle drive Breckenridge separates and goes to a bar where he gets drunk. Two former Confederates confront Breckenridge and accuse him of cowardice during a battle in the Civil War. Although Stribling and O'Malley team up to try and save Breckenridge's life, Breckinridge is shot in the back and killed trying to leave the bar. Stribling and O'Malley respond by shooting the man who shot Breckinridge, and then bury Breckinridge back at the cattle drive camp.\n\nAlong the journey, Stribling and Belle become attracted to each other and plan to marry. O'Malley is crushed when he sees them and eventually falls in love with Missy, who convinces him she\u2019s not too young for him.\n\nThe group manages to get safely to Texas where Belle begs Stribling not to confront O\u2019Malley. He has mixed feelings but doesn\u2019t want to back down. On the eve of the showdown between the two men, Belle discloses the secret that Missy is the daughter of O'Malley and their incestuous love cannot continue. He is stunned but refuses to believe her. He spends the day with Missy and promises to leave with her. At the gunfight, O'Malley faces the sheriff with an unloaded gun, effectively committing suicide.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rock Hudson]] as Dana Stribling\n*[[Kirk Douglas]] as Brendan \"Bren\" O'Malley\n*[[Dorothy Malone]] as Belle Breckenridge\n*[[Joseph Cotten]] as John Breckenridge\n*[[Carol Lynley]] as Melissa \"Missy\" Breckenridge\n*[[Neville Brand]] as Frank Hobbs\n*[[Regis Toomey]] as Milton Wing\n*Rad Fulton as Julesburg Kid\n*[[Adam Williams (actor)|Adam Williams]] as Calverton\n*[[Jack Elam]] as Ed Hobbs\n*John Shay as Bowman\n\n==Production==\nIn 1959 Kirk Douglas announced he had bought the rights to ''Day of the Gun'' by Richard Telfair (the pen name for [[Richard Jessup]]).<ref>STAGE IS A SMASH IN MOVIE CAPITAL: Hollywood Area Has Off-Broadway Flavor With 10 Theatres in Operation By MURRAY SCHUMACHS New York Times ]30 Apr 1959: 36.</ref>\n\nIn December 1959 it was announced Douglas and Rock Hudson would star in ''Day of the Gun'' from the novel by Howard Vechel, filming to begin in Mexico in March.

Other variants utilize a chilled, or heated water loop for space cooling, or heating, respectively.]]\n[[Image:Fancoil 1.jpg|250px|right]]\n[[Image:Fancoil 2.jpg|250px|right]]\nA '''fan coil unit''' (FCU), also known as a '''Vertical Fan Coil-Unit''' (VFC), is a simple device consisting of a heating and/or cooling [[heat exchanger]] or 'coil' and [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]]. It is part of an [[HVAC]] system found in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. A fan coil unit is a diverse device sometimes using [[Duct (HVAC)|ductwork]], and is used to control the temperature in the space where it is installed, or serve multiple spaces. It is controlled either by a manual on/off switch or by a [[thermostat]], which controls the throughput of water to the heat exchanger using a [[Control valves|control valve]] and/or the fan speed.\n\nDue to their simplicity and flexibility, fan coil units can be more economical to install than ducted [[Variable air volume|100% fresh air systems (VAV)]] or central heating systems with [[air handling unit]]s or [[Chilled beam|chilled beams]]. Various unit configurations are available, including horizontal (ceiling mounted) or vertical (floor mounted).\n\nNoise output from FCUs, like any other form of air conditioning, is principally due to the design of the unit and the building materials around it. Some offer noise levels as low as [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nr-noise-rating-d_60.html NR25] or [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nc-noise-criterion-d_725.html NC25]\n\nThe output from an FCU can be established by looking at the temperature of the air entering the unit and the temperature of the air leaving the unit, coupled with the volume of air being moved through the unit. This is a simplistic statement, and there is further reading on [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/shr-sensible-heat-ratio-d_700.html sensible heat ratios] and the specific [[heat capacity]] of air, both of which have an effect on thermal performance.\n\n==Design and operation==\n''Fan Coil Unit'' covers a range of products and will mean different things to users, specifiers, and installers in different countries and regions, particularly in relation to product size and output capability.\n\nFan Coil Unit falls principally into two main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, in the first type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, and in the other type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are considered thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.\n\nA fan coil unit may be concealed or exposed within the room or area that it serves.\n\nAn exposed fan coil unit may be wall-mounted, freestanding or ceiling mounted, and will typically include an appropriate enclosure to protect and conceal the fan coil unit itself, with return air [[grille]] and supply air [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]] set into that enclosure to distribute the air.\n\nA concealed fan coil unit will typically be installed within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The return air grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted to and from the fan coil unit and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a return air plenum.\n\nThe coil receives hot or cold water from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through [[heat transfer]]. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal [[thermostat]], or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a [[Building Management System|Building Energy Management System]] (BEMS), the control of the fan coil unit will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.\n\nFan coil units circulate hot or cold water through a coil in order to condition a space. The unit gets its hot or cold water from a central plant, or [[mechanical room]] containing equipment for removing heat from the central building's closed-loop. The equipment used can consist of machines used to remove heat such as a [[chiller]] or a [[cooling tower]] and equipment for adding heat to the building's water such as a [[boiler]] or a commercial [[water heating|water heater]].\n\nFan coil units are divided into two types: Two-pipe fan coil units or four-pipe fan coil units. Two-pipe fan coil units have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe supplies either cold or hot water to the unit depending on the time of year. Four-pipe fan coil units have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe fan coil unit is most commonly used.\n\nFan coil units may be connected to piping networks using various topology designs, such as \"direct return\", \"reverse return\", or \"series decoupled\".  See ASHRAE Handbook \"2008 Systems & Equipment\", Chapter 12. \n\nDepending upon the selected chilled water temperatures and the relative humidity of the space, it is likely that the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.\n\nSpeed control of the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some manufacturers accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat.  Building Energy Management Systems can be used for automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor.  More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.[http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/]\n\n==DC/EC motor powered units==\nThese motors are sometimes called DC motors, sometimes called [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC motors]] and occasionally [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC/DC motors]]. DC stands for Direct Current and EC stands for Electronically Commutated.\n\n[[DC motor]]s allow the speed of the fans within a Fan Coil Unit to be controlled by means of a 0-10 Volt input 'Signal' to the motor/s, the transformers and speed switches associated with AC Fan Coils are not required. Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. Fan Coils will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the Fan Coil is likely to be too noisy for most commercial applications.\n\nThe 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be set via a simple potentiometer and left or the 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be delivered to the fan motors by the terminal controller on each of the Fan Coil Units. The former is very simple and cheap but the latter opens up the opportunity to continuously alter the fan speed depending on various external conditions/influences. These conditions/criteria could be the 'real time' demand for either heating or cooling, occupancy levels, window switches, time clocks or any number of other inputs from either the unit itself, the Building Management System or both. \n\nThe reason that these DC Fan Coil Units are, despite their apparent relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels compared to their AC motor driven counterparts of only a few years ago. A straight swap, AC to DC, will reduce electrical consumption by 50% but applying Demand and Occupancy dependent fan speed control can take the savings to as much as 80%. In areas of the world where there are legally enforceable energy efficiency requirements for Fan Coils (such as the UK), DC Fan Coil Units are rapidly becoming the only choice.\n\n==Areas of use==\n[[Image:Fan coil 1.jpg|200px|left]]\n[[Image:Fan coil 2.jpg|200px|left]]In high-rise buildings, fan coils may be vertically stacked, located one above the other from floor to floor and all interconnected by the same piping loop.\n\nFan coil units are an excellent delivery mechanism for hydronic [[chiller boiler|chiller boiler systems]] in large residential and light commercial applications.  In these applications the fan coil units are mounted in bathroom ceilings and can be used to provide unlimited comfort zones - with the ability to turn off unused areas of the structure to save energy.\n\n==Installation==\nIn high-rise residential construction, typically each fan coil unit requires a rectangular through-penetration in the [[concrete]] slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or at least on the chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.\n\n==Unit ventilator==\nA unit ventilator is a fan coil unit that is used mainly in classrooms, hotels, apartments and condominium applications. A unit ventilator can be a wall mounted or ceiling hung cabinet, and is designed to use a [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] to blow outside air across a coil, thus conditioning and ventilating the space which it is serving.\n\n==European market==\nThe Fan Coil is composed of one quarter of 2-pipe-units and three quarters of 4-pipe-units, and the most sold products are \"with casing\" (35%), \"without casing\" (28%), \"cassette\" (18%) and \"ducted\" (16%).<ref>Eurovent Market Intelligence https://www.eurovent-marketintelligence.eu/</ref>\n\nThe market by region was split in 2010 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-right:auto; border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Some offer noise levels as low as [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nr-noise-rating-d_60.html NR25] or [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/nc-noise-criterion-d_725.html NC25]\n\nThe output from an FCU can be established by looking at the temperature of the air entering the unit and the temperature of the air leaving the unit, coupled with the volume of air being moved through the unit. This is a simplistic statement, and there is further reading on [http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/shr-sensible-heat-ratio-d_700.html sensible heat ratios] and the specific [[heat capacity]] of air, both of which have an effect on thermal performance.\n\n==Design and operation==\n''Fan Coil Unit'' covers a range of products and will mean different things to users, specifiers, and installers in different countries and regions, particularly in relation to product size and output capability.\n\nFan Coil Unit falls principally into two main types: blow through and draw through. As the names suggest, in the first type the fans are fitted such that they blow through the heat exchanger, and in the other type the fans are fitted after the coil such that they draw air through it. Draw through units are considered thermally superior, as ordinarily they make better use of the heat exchanger. However they are more expensive, as they require a chassis to hold the fans whereas a blow-through unit typically consists of a set of fans bolted straight to a coil.\n\nA fan coil unit may be concealed or exposed within the room or area that it serves.\n\nAn exposed fan coil unit may be wall-mounted, freestanding or ceiling mounted, and will typically include an appropriate enclosure to protect and conceal the fan coil unit itself, with return air [[grille]] and supply air [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffuser]] set into that enclosure to distribute the air.\n\nA concealed fan coil unit will typically be installed within an accessible ceiling void or services zone. The return air grille and supply air diffuser, typically set flush into the ceiling, will be ducted to and from the fan coil unit and thus allows a great degree of flexibility for locating the grilles to suit the ceiling layout and/or the partition layout within a space. It is quite common for the return air not to be ducted and to use the ceiling void as a return air plenum.\n\nThe coil receives hot or cold water from a central plant, and removes heat from or adds heat to the air through [[heat transfer]]. Traditionally fan coil units can contain their own internal [[thermostat]], or can be wired to operate with a remote thermostat. However, and as is common in most modern buildings with a [[Building Management System|Building Energy Management System]] (BEMS), the control of the fan coil unit will be by a local digital controller or outstation (along with associated room temperature sensor and control valve actuators) linked to the BEMS via a communication network, and therefore adjustable and controllable from a central point, such as a supervisors head end computer.\n\nFan coil units circulate hot or cold water through a coil in order to condition a space. The unit gets its hot or cold water from a central plant, or [[mechanical room]] containing equipment for removing heat from the central building's closed-loop. The equipment used can consist of machines used to remove heat such as a [[chiller]] or a [[cooling tower]] and equipment for adding heat to the building's water such as a [[boiler]] or a commercial [[water heater]].\n\nFan coil units are divided into two types: Two-pipe fan coil units or four-pipe fan coil units. Two-pipe fan coil units have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe supplies either cold or hot water to the unit depending on the time of year. Four-pipe fan coil units have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe fan coil unit is most commonly used.\n\nFan coil units may be connected to piping networks using various topology designs, such as \"direct return\", \"reverse return\", or \"series decoupled\".  See ASHRAE Handbook \"2008 Systems & Equipment\", Chapter 12. \n\nDepending upon the selected chilled water temperatures and the relative humidity of the space, it is likely that the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain. The fan coil unit will contain a purpose designed drip tray with drain connection for this purpose. The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple fan coil units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point. Alternatively a condensate pump may be employed where space for such gravity pipework is limited.\n\nSpeed control of the fan motors within a fan coil unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some manufacturers accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the fan coil unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat.  Building Energy Management Systems can be used for automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor.  More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation. Compared to units with asynchronous 3-speed motors, the fan coil units with brushless motors will reduce the power consumption up to 70%.[http://heinenhopman.com/en/merchant/fan-coil-unit/]\n\n==DC/EC motor powered units==\nThese motors are sometimes called DC motors, sometimes called [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC motors]] and occasionally [[Brushless DC electric motor|EC/DC motors]]. DC stands for Direct Current and EC stands for Electronically Commutated.\n\n[[DC motor]]s allow the speed of the fans within a Fan Coil Unit to be controlled by means of a 0-10 Volt input 'Signal' to the motor/s, the transformers and speed switches associated with AC Fan Coils are not required. Up to a signal voltage of 2.5 Volts (which may vary with different fan/motor manufacturers) the fan will be in a stopped condition but as the signal voltage is increased, the fan will seamlessly increase in speed until the maximum is reached at a signal Voltage of 10 Volts. Fan Coils will generally operate between approximately 4 Volts and 7.5 Volts because below 4 Volts the air volumes are ineffective and above 7.5 Volts the Fan Coil is likely to be too noisy for most commercial applications.\n\nThe 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be set via a simple potentiometer and left or the 0-10 Volt signal voltage can be delivered to the fan motors by the terminal controller on each of the Fan Coil Units. The former is very simple and cheap but the latter opens up the opportunity to continuously alter the fan speed depending on various external conditions/influences. These conditions/criteria could be the 'real time' demand for either heating or cooling, occupancy levels, window switches, time clocks or any number of other inputs from either the unit itself, the Building Management System or both. \n\nThe reason that these DC Fan Coil Units are, despite their apparent relative complexity, becoming more popular is their improved energy efficiency levels compared to their AC motor driven counterparts of only a few years ago. A straight swap, AC to DC, will reduce electrical consumption by 50% but applying Demand and Occupancy dependent fan speed control can take the savings to as much as 80%. In areas of the world where there are legally enforceable energy efficiency requirements for Fan Coils (such as the UK), DC Fan Coil Units are rapidly becoming the only choice.\n\n==Areas of use==\n[[Image:Fan coil 1.jpg|200px|left]]\n[[Image:Fan coil 2.jpg|200px|left]]In high-rise buildings, fan coils may be vertically stacked, located one above the other from floor to floor and all interconnected by the same piping loop.\n\nFan coil units are an excellent delivery mechanism for hydronic [[chiller boiler|chiller boiler systems]] in large residential and light commercial applications.  In these applications the fan coil units are mounted in bathroom ceilings and can be used to provide unlimited comfort zones - with the ability to turn off unused areas of the structure to save energy.\n\n==Installation==\nIn high-rise residential construction, typically each fan coil unit requires a rectangular through-penetration in the [[concrete]] slab on top of which it sits. Usually, there are either 2 or 4 pipes made of ABS, steel or copper that go through the floor. The pipes are usually insulated with refrigeration insulation, such as acrylonitrile butadiene/polyvinyl chloride (AB/PVC) flexible foam (Rubatex or Armaflex brands) on all pipes, or at least on the chilled water lines to prevent condensate from forming.\n\n==Unit ventilator==\nA unit ventilator is a fan coil unit that is used mainly in classrooms, hotels, apartments and condominium applications. A unit ventilator can be a wall mounted or ceiling hung cabinet, and is designed to use a [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]] to blow outside air across a coil, thus conditioning and ventilating the space which it is serving.\n\n==European market==\nThe Fan Coil is composed of one quarter of 2-pipe-units and three quarters of 4-pipe-units, and the most sold products are \"with casing\" (35%), \"without casing\" (28%), \"cassette\" (18%) and \"ducted\" (16%).<ref>Eurovent Market Intelligence https://www.eurovent-marketintelligence.eu/</ref>\n\nThe market by region was split in 2010 as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-right:auto; border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The plot was inspired by [[Quijano de Manila]]'s January 1961 article ''\"The House on Zapote Street\"'', which first appeared on an issue of the [[Philippines Free Press|Philippines Free Press magazine]] and was later republished in de Manila's non-fiction [[true crime|crime anthology]], ''Reportage on Crime'' (1977).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/254429/inquirers-guyito-symbol-hope-filmmakers-fight-free-cinema|title=Inquirer's Guyito a symbol of hope in filmmaker's fight for free cinema|last=Calimlim|first=Aldrin|date=October 27, 2016|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/young-star/2010/02/26/552580/pop-crimes-quijano-de-manilas-reportage-crime|title=Pop crimes: Quijano de Manila's 'Reportage on Crime'|last=Romulo|first=Erwin T.|date=February 26, 2010|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref> It starred Vic Silayan, Charo Santos, Jay Ilagan, and Charito Solis.\n\nReleased during the [[1981 Metro Manila Film Festival|7th Metro Manila Film Festival]], the film barely broke even at the box office. However, it received unanimous critical acclaim, establishing De Leon as one of the great directors of the new generation. It eventually won the festival's most coveted title of \"Best Film,\" garnered ten major awards in FAMAS, was presented in Cannes in the Director's Fortnight, and was adjudged by the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino as one of the Ten Best Films of the 1980s.\n\nIt was the first major treatment of [[incest]] in Philippine cinema, which was considered daring for its time. Other strong subject matters covered were [[murder]], [[suicide]] and [[parricide]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDadong Carandang ([[Vic Silayan|Silayan]]), a retired police officer, is the domineering father of Mila ([[Charo Santos|Santos]]), and he is extremely jealous of the latter's suitors, never allowing them into his house. One day, Mila falls in love with Noel Manalansan ([[Jay Ilagan|Ilagan]]) and they decide to seek Dadong's permission to get married. Mila finds out she is pregnant. Dadong agrees on the condition that Noel pay a ridiculously costly dowry as well as shoulder a luxurious wedding. Noel agrees and works hard to meet Dadong's demands.\n\nAfter the wedding, Dadong insists that the couple stay in his house. Despite protestations by the couple, they acquiesce. The couple is not allowed to sleep together for various reasons, i.e., that Mila's mother Dely ([[Charito Solis|Solis]]) is sick and Mila needs to comfort her through the night.\n\nAfter several months of living in this misery, the couple decide to escape. They were hunted by Dadong, to no avail. One day Dadong changes his tactic and makes some compromises to bring them back. Eventually, the couple decides to go back to Dadong's house, but only to gather their belongings. Dadong pleads with Mila not to leave as it is revealed that he has been carrying out an incestuous relationship with his daughter all along, and the baby is his. When Mila and Noel stand firm on leaving, Dadong is driven to desperation and brings out his gun, shooting Dely, Noel, and then finally, Mila. Seeing to no longer consume himself in such obsession, he shoots himself.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Vic Silayan]] as Sgt.

The screenplay was written by [[Mike De Leon]], [[Clodualdo del Mundo Jr.|Doy del Mundo]], and Raquel Villavicencio; the same team who previously collaborated ''\"[[Kakabakaba Ka Ba]]\"'' (1980) and would later work on ''\"[[Batch '81]]\"'' (1982).

The plot was inspired by [[Quijano de Manila]]'s January 1961 article ''\"The House on Zapote Street\"'', which first appeared on an issue of the [[Philippines Free Press|Philippines Free Press magazine]] and was later republished in de Manila's non-fiction [[true crime|crime anthology]], ''Reportage on Crime'' (1977).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/254429/inquirers-guyito-symbol-hope-filmmakers-fight-free-cinema|title=Inquirer's Guyito a symbol of hope in filmmaker's fight for free cinema|last=Calimlim|first=Aldrin|date=October 27, 2016|publisher=[[CNN Philippines]]|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/young-star/2010/02/26/552580/pop-crimes-quijano-de-manilas-reportage-crime|title=Pop crimes: Quijano de Manila's 'Reportage on Crime'|last=Romulo|first=Erwin T.|date=February 26, 2010|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|accessdate=December 16, 2019}}</ref> It starred Vic Silayan, Charo Santos, Jay Ilagan, and Charito Solis.\n\nReleased during the [[1981 Metro Manila Film Festival|7th Metro Manila Film Festival]], the film barely broke even at the box office. However, it received unanimous critical acclaim, establishing De Leon as one of the great directors of the new generation. It eventually won the festival's most coveted title of \"Best Film,\" garnered ten major awards in FAMAS, was presented in Cannes in the Director's Fortnight, and was adjudged by the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino as one of the Ten Best Films of the 1980s.\n\nIt was the first major treatment of [[incest]] in Philippine cinema, which was considered daring for its time. Other strong subject matters covered were [[murder]], [[suicide]] and [[parricide]].\n\n== Plot ==\nDadong Carandang ([[Vic Silayan|Silayan]]), a retired police officer, is the domineering father of Mila ([[Charo Santos|Santos]]), and he is extremely jealous of the latter's suitors, never allowing them into his house. One day, Mila falls in love with Noel Manalansan ([[Jay Ilagan|Ilagan]]) and they decide to seek Dadong's permission to get married. Mila finds out she is pregnant. Dadong agrees on the condition that Noel pay a ridiculously costly dowry as well as shoulder a luxurious wedding. Noel agrees and works hard to meet Dadong's demands.\n\nAfter the wedding, Dadong insists that the couple stay in his house. Despite protestations by the couple, they acquiesce. The couple is not allowed to sleep together for various reasons, i.e., that Mila's mother Dely ([[Charito Solis|Solis]]) is sick and Mila needs to comfort her through the night.\n\nAfter several months of living in this misery, the couple decide to escape. They were hunted by Dadong, to no avail. One day Dadong changes his tactic and makes some compromises to bring them back. Eventually, the couple decides to go back to Dadong's house, but only to gather their belongings. Dadong pleads with Mila not to leave as it is revealed that he has been carrying out an incestuous relationship with his daughter all along, and the baby is his. When Mila and Noel stand firm on leaving, Dadong is driven to desperation and brings out his gun, shooting Dely, Noel, and then finally, Mila. Seeing to no longer consume himself in such obsession, he shoots himself.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Vic Silayan]] as Sgt.

The screenplay was written by [[Mike De Leon]], [[Clodualdo del Mundo Jr.|Doy del Mundo]], and Raquel Villavicencio; the same team who previously collaborated ''\"[[Kakabakaba Ka Ba]]\"'' (1980) and would later work on ''\"[[Batch '81]]\"'' (1982).

It is based upon the novel of the same name by William Giraldi and stars [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[James Badge Dale]], [[Riley Keough]], Tantoo Cardinal, and Julian Black Antelope.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2018 and was released on September 28, 2018, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2004, Russell Core ([[Jeffrey Wright]]), a writer who studies wolf behavior, is summoned to the village of Keelut, [[Alaska]] by Medora Slone ([[Riley Keough]]), who wants him to hunt down the wolves blamed for the disappearance and presumed death of three small children, including Medora's 6-year-old son, Bailey Slone. Core stays at the Slone house, and tries to tell Medora that this type of wolf behavior doesn't happen.  Medora says \"It happened to me.\"  Medora tells him that there is darkness there, and tells him of a hot springs to the north of town, which is the only warm place she's ever known.  She also says her husband is away fighting in the war, and that he told her he would never leave her.  In the middle of the night, Core wakes and sees Medora scrubbing her skin in the bath.  When she is finished, she lays down naked next to Core without saying anything and they sleep.\n\nMedora's husband Vernon Slone ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), overseas in Afghanistan,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/09/hold-the-dark-review/571120/|title=Hold the Dark Is a Revenge Epic That\u2019s Not Quite What It Seems|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=September 28, 2018}}</ref> mercilessly guns down Afghan militants. Stationed at a checkpoint when shooting breaks out, Vernon rescues a local woman who is being raped by another American, wounding him with a knife and then handing the bloodied knife to the woman for her to take revenge. Leaving the house, he is caught in an ambush and shot but survives to be sent home. After he is shot and being transported, he dreams about the hot spring, a flashback of himself and Medora going there when they were younger and making love in the steamy cavern.\n\nIn the morning, Core leaves town to track the wolves, and meets an old native woman along the way out of town, Illanaq, who tells him he is going the wrong way, and that Medora 'knows evil'. Core tracks the wolves, finding the hot springs Medora mentioned, and spots a pack of wolves eating their young. Unwilling to shoot them, Core returns to Keelut. At the Slone house, he finds Medora missing and discovers Bailey's frozen, strangled body in the cellar. The police investigate, and native villagers claim Medora is possessed by a wolf-demon called a ''tournaq''.\n\nVernon's friend and father to another missing child, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope), meets him at the airport and brings him to police chief Donald Marium ([[James Badge Dale]]), Core, and other officers at the morgue. After Marium leaves with Core, Vernon kills the officers and the coroner and takes his son's body. Cheeon builds a coffin, and Vernon buries his son in the snow, just after cutting his own arm and marking his son's body with blood, a Yup'ik burial ritual. \n\nVernon reads the file and after burning it he goes to visit the witch. She tells him the wolves had come before, that their history involves the wolves before. She claims no responsibility for what happened.  She tells him about the influenza which spread through the village and took the lives of many, with nowhere to bury them with the ground frozen.  This is a reference to the great influenza of 1918, which took out entire villages of Yup'ik people in Alaska.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ankn.uaf.edu/Publications/Books/Yuuyaraq.pdf|author=Napoleon, Harold|title=Yuuyuraq:  The Way of the Human Being|date=1996}}</ref>\n\nDiscovering the officers murdered and Bailey's body missing, Marium realizes Vernon is responsible.\n\nCore, remembering the old woman's warning, arrives in Keelut at the same time as the police. He finds another dead body. As officers take up position Cheeon's house, Marium approaches to ask about his involvement with the murders and to give him an opportunity to surrender before they take him in. Cheeon talks about the government's neglect of Keelut and how it has affected their village.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2018/10/01/hold-the-dark-shootout-scene/|title=Hold the Dark Shootout Scene|newspaper=Decider|date=October 1, 2018}}</ref>  He then warns Marium that he will not go peacefully, and as Marium returns to his position with the other officers, Cheeon opens fire on them from a second floor window with a tripod mounted machine gun.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Hold_the_Dark|title=Weapons Used in Hold the Dark|newspaper=Internet Movie Firearms Database}}</ref>  The shoot out continues, with many officers being wounded and killed.  Marium asks another officer to cover him while he tries to enter the house from the rear.  As Cheeon continues shooting, Core drags a wounded officer to safety.  Cheeon is about to shoot them, when Core yells \"Stop!\" and Cheeon ceases fire for a moment.  At this moment, Marium sneaks past an entryway trip wire, ascends the steps to the second floor and kills Cheeon, who falls from the window to the front yard.\n \nAt an inn outside a tourist mine where Medora was sighted, Vernon meets John, an elderly hunter who treated him with wolf-oil as a child for his apparent [[psychopathy]]. At John's invitation, Vernon takes a mask from the wall. He dons it and kills John, and is shot in the shoulder by the innkeeper as he leaves. He visits Shan, an old friend who is seen snorting a white powder just before Vernon arrives.  Shan removes the bullet and Vernon falls asleep.\n\nCore and Marium theorize that Medora killed Bailey to \u201csave him from darkness\u201d. Core believes Medora may have gone to the springs, and he and Marium agree to try to find her before Vernon does. Following Shan's mending of his shoulder, Vernon has a dream of himself and Medora in the hot springs. Upon waking, and overhearing Shan informing the police about Vernon, he kills Shan. Core and Marium fly to the hot springs in a small plane. Examining wolf tracks in the snow, Marium is shot through the neck by an arrow fired by Vernon in the trees, wearing the mask. Hoping to intercept Vernon in the springs, Core finds Medora, and tells her he is coming.  Core is shot in the chest by an arrow from Vernon. As Vernon strangles Medora, she pushes the mask off his face, and he releases her. They embrace, and Core falls unconscious. \n\nAfter Core awakens, Vernon removes the arrow before leaving with Medora. Core crawls outside the cave, encountering a pack of wolves.

It is based upon the novel of the same name by William Giraldi and stars [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[James Badge Dale]], [[Riley Keough]], Tantoo Cardinal, and Julian Black Antelope.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2018 and was released on September 28, 2018, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2004, Russell Core ([[Jeffrey Wright]]), a writer who studies wolf behavior, is summoned to the village of Keelut, [[Alaska]] by Medora Slone ([[Riley Keough]]), who wants him to hunt down the wolves blamed for the disappearance and presumed death of three small children, including Medora's 6-year-old son, Bailey Slone. Core stays at the Slone house, and tries to tell Medora that this type of wolf behavior doesn't happen.  Medora says \"It happened to me.\"  Medora tells him that there is darkness there, and tells him of a hot springs to the north of town, which is the only warm place she's ever known.  She also says her husband is away fighting in the war, and that he told her he would never leave her.  In the middle of the night, Core wakes and sees Medora scrubbing her skin in the bath.  When she is finished, she lays down naked next to Core without saying anything and they sleep.\n\nMedora's husband Vernon Slone ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), overseas in Afghanistan,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/09/hold-the-dark-review/571120/|title=Hold the Dark Is a Revenge Epic That\u2019s Not Quite What It Seems|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=September 28, 2018}}</ref> mercilessly guns down Afghan militants. Stationed at a checkpoint when shooting breaks out, Vernon rescues a local woman who is being raped by another American, wounding him with a knife and then handing the bloodied knife to the woman for her to take revenge. Leaving the house, he is caught in an ambush and shot but survives to be sent home. After he is shot and being transported, he dreams about the hot spring, a flashback of himself and Medora going there when they were younger and making love in the steamy cavern.\n\nIn the morning, Core leaves town to track the wolves, and meets an old native woman along the way out of town, Illanaq, who tells him he is going the wrong way, and that Medora 'knows evil'. Core tracks the wolves, finding the hot springs Medora mentioned, and spots a pack of wolves eating their young. Unwilling to shoot them, Core returns to Keelut. At the Slone house, he finds Medora missing and discovers Bailey's frozen, strangled body in the cellar. The police investigate, and native villagers claim Medora is possessed by a wolf-demon called a ''tournaq''.\n\nVernon's friend and father to another missing child, Cheeon (Julian Black Antelope), meets him at the airport and brings him to police chief Donald Marium ([[James Badge Dale]]), Core, and other officers at the morgue. After Marium leaves with Core, Vernon kills the officers and the coroner and takes his son's body. Cheeon builds a coffin, and Vernon buries his son in the snow, just after cutting his own arm and marking his son's body with blood, a Yup'ik burial ritual. \n\nVernon reads the file and after burning it he goes to visit the witch. She tells him the wolves had come before, that their history involves the wolves before. She claims no responsibility for what happened.  She tells him about the influenza which spread through the village and took the lives of many, with nowhere to bury them with the ground frozen.  This is a reference to the great influenza of 1918, which took out entire villages of Yup'ik people in Alaska.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ankn.uaf.edu/Publications/Books/Yuuyaraq.pdf|author=Napoleon, Harold|title=Yuuyuraq:  The Way of the Human Being|date=1996}}</ref>\n\nDiscovering the officers murdered and Bailey\u2019s body missing, Marium realizes Vernon is responsible.\n\nCore, remembering the old woman's warning, arrives in Keelut at the same time as the police. He finds another dead body. As officers take up position Cheeon\u2019s house, Marium approaches to ask about his involvement with the murders and to give him an opportunity to surrender before they take him in. Cheeon talks about the government's neglect of Keelut and how it has affected their village.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2018/10/01/hold-the-dark-shootout-scene/|title=Hold the Dark Shootout Scene|newspaper=Decider|date=October 1, 2018}}</ref>  He then warns Marium that he will not go peacefully, and as Marium returns to his position with the other officers, Cheeon opens fire on them from a second floor window with a tripod mounted machine gun.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Hold_the_Dark|title=Weapons Used in Hold the Dark|newspaper=Internet Movie Firearms Database}}</ref>  The shoot out continues, with many officers being wounded and killed.  Marium asks another officer to cover him while he tries to enter the house from the rear.  As Cheeon continues shooting, Core drags a wounded officer to safety.  Cheeon is about to shoot them, when Core yells \"Stop!\" and Cheeon ceases fire for a moment.  At this moment, Marium sneaks past an entryway trip wire, ascends the steps to the second floor and kills Cheeon, who falls from the window to the front yard.\n \nAt an inn outside a tourist mine where Medora was sighted, Vernon meets John, an elderly hunter who treated him with wolf-oil as a child for his apparent [[psychopathy]]. At John\u2019s invitation, Vernon takes a mask from the wall. He dons it and kills John, and is shot in the shoulder by the innkeeper as he leaves. He visits Shan, an old friend who is seen snorting a white powder just before Vernon arrives.  Shan removes the bullet and Vernon falls asleep.\n\nCore and Marium theorize that Medora killed Bailey to \u201csave him from darkness\u201d. Core believes Medora may have gone to the springs, and he and Marium agree to try to find her before Vernon does. Following Shan's mending of his shoulder, Vernon has a dream of himself and Medora in the hot springs. Upon waking, and overhearing Shan informing the police about Vernon, he kills Shan. Core and Marium fly to the hot springs in a small plane. Examining wolf tracks in the snow, Marium is shot through the neck by an arrow fired by Vernon in the trees, wearing the mask. Hoping to intercept Vernon in the springs, Core finds Medora, and tells her he is coming.  Core is shot in the chest by an arrow from Vernon. As Vernon strangles Medora, she pushes the mask off his face, and he releases her. They embrace, and Core falls unconscious. \n\nAfter Core awakens, Vernon removes the arrow before leaving with Medora. Core crawls outside the cave, encountering a pack of wolves. He is found by a father and son with a snowmobile and brought to their home for care, as Vernon's mother looks on. Vernon and Medora dig up Bailey's grave, and pull the coffin behind them as they trek through the snow. Core wakes up in the hospital, his daughter Amy at his bedside.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Russell Core\n* [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Vernon Slone\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Donald Marium\n* [[Riley Keough]] as Medora Slone\n* Julian Black Antelope as Cheeon\n* [[Macon Blair]] as Shan\n* [[Tantoo Cardinal]] as Illanaq\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Trapper John\n* Beckham Crawford as Bailey\n* Jonathan Whitesell as Arnie\n* Bobbi Jaye as Amy Core\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2015, it was announced [[Jeremy Saulnier]] would direct the film, based upon a screenplay by [[Macon Blair]], while Eva Maria Daniels, Russell Ackerman and John Schoenfelder would produce the film under their VisionChaos Productions banner and Addictive Pictures banners respectively, [[A24 (company)|A24]] would distribute the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/hold-the-dark-jeremy-saulnier-director-1201601704/|title=A24, \u2018Green Room\u2019 Helmer Reteaming on Thriller \u2018Hold the Dark\u2019|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Justin|last=Kroll|date=September 24, 2015|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, [[Netflix]] acquired distribution rights to the film, with Anish Savjani and [[Neil Kopp]] joining as producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/netflix-alaskan-thriller-hold-the-dark-green-room-1201971151/|title=Netflix to Distribute Thriller \u2018Hold the Dark\u2019 With \u2018Green Room\u2019 Director|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref> In February 2017, [[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Riley Keough]], [[James Bloor (actor)|James Bloor]], [[James Badge Dale]] and [[Jeffrey Wright]], joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jeffrey-wright-alexander-skarsgard-james-badge-dale-star-netflix-thriller-hold-dark-9745|title=Jeffrey Wright, Alexander Skarsgard, James Badge Dale to Star in Netflix Thriller 'Hold the Dark' (Exclusive)|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Borys|last=Kit|date=February 10, 2017|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 27, 2017, and concluded on April 26, 2017.
