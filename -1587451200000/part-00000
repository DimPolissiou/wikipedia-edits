Formed in 1987 in [[Lodi, New Jersey]], the group early on became an unique voice in the [[Rock music|rock]] scene, playing a [[blues rock|bluesy]], [[Groove (music)|groove]]-laden metal with Danzig crooning in the style of [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. Danzig's openly [[Satan|satanic]]  lyrics and image stirred a degree of controversy. After a major hit with a live version of 1988 track \"[[Mother (Danzig song)|Mother]]\", the band experimented with [[industrial music]] and, later on, came back to form. Danzig's latest release is ''[[Danzig Sings Elvis]]''.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/danzig-mn0000957085/biography|title=Danzig - Biography & History|last=Huey|first=Steve|date=|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=|accessdate=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/10/14/glenn-danzigs-sympathy-devil|title=Glenn Danzig's Sympathy for the Devil|author=EW Staff|date=14 October 1994|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=|accessdate=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Revolver\">{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/danzig-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-glenn-danzigs-first-solo-album|title='Danzig': 10 Things You Didn't Know About Glenn Danzig's First Solo Album|last=Epstein|first=Dan|date=30 August 2018|publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|access-date=|accessdate=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings (1986\u20131987)===\nOn July 14, 1986, [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] performed at [[Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in [[New York City|New York]] in what was to be their final show. In attendance was [[Rick Rubin]], who was scouting for potential bands to sign to his record label, [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Rubin initially wished to only sign Danzig himself, with the intent of making him the vocalist for a hard rock [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] that Rubin envisioned. However, Danzig refused to sign to Rubin's label without including Samhain's bassist [[Eerie Von]]. In 1987, he added [[John Christ]] on guitar and [[Chuck Biscuits]] (ex-[[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]) on drums.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| page= 241\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> To reflect the change in musical direction and avoid having to start anew after future lineup changes, Glenn, on Rubin's advice, changed the name of Samhain to his surname, Danzig.<ref>{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/glenn-danzig-422-v17n5 |title=Glenn Danzig |publisher=VICE |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}</ref> The first release from the band, minus Eerie Von, was the song \"You And Me (Less Than Zero)\" from the [[Less Than Zero (soundtrack)|Less Than Zero]] soundtrack and credited as Glenn Danzig & The Power and Fury Orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/my-favorite-soundtrack-less-than-zero |title=My Favorite Soundtrack: Less than Zero |website=Noisey.vice.com |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===\"Classic\" original lineup-era (1988\u20131994)===\nIn 1988, Danzig released its [[Danzig (album)|self-titled debut album]] on Def American (later renamed to [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The band toured worldwide in support of the album throughout 1988 and 1989; they opened for [[Slayer]] on their ''[[South of Heaven]]'' tour in North America and [[Metallica]] on their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' [[Damaged Justice|tour]] in Europe,<ref name=\"misfitscentral dates\">{{cite web|title=Danzig Tour Dates|url=http://www.misfitscentral.com/danzig/tourdates.php|publisher=misfitscentral.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SLAYER|url=http://metallipromo.com/slay.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> and subsequently headlined their own tour, which included support from bands such as [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[Mudhoney]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Armored Saint]], [[Circus of Power]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Sick of It All]] and [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]].<ref name=\"misfitscentral dates\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Armored Saint|url=http://www.metallipromo.com/armored.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> ''Danzig'' is the band's best-selling album, having been certified Gold in the U.S. in 1994,<ref name=\"Kerrang!\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=darticle&f=kerrang.94|title=Black Gold!|last=Chirazi|first=Steffan|date=Spring 1994|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref> and eventually going Platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/bios/danzig.cfm|title=DANZIG Interview|last=Farr|first=Sara|date=August 2005|publisher=Unrated Magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Danzig released its second album, ''[[Danzig II: Lucifuge]]''. By 1992, Rubin's involvement with the band had waned. Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, ''[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill]]''. In the following year, the band released the ''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]'' EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's 1992 Halloween show as well as three new studio tracks. The live version of \"[[Mother (Danzig song)|Mother]],\" a song from the first album, became popular on hard rock radio stations. A new version of the \"Mother\" music video was created using live footage, and the video became a hit on [[MTV]] as well.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nOn October 4, 1994, ''[[Danzig 4]]'' was released. The album sold well, but did not contain a hit on par with the \"Mother\" single. The album's second single, \"Cantspeak\", was also a staple in MTV's rotation, but unlike \"Mother\" failed to appear on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"Cantspeak\" is the band's only single other than \"Mother\" to chart on Billboard. Amid accusations of unpaid royalties and broken promises, Danzig's relationship with Rubin deteriorated, and the band left the record label.\n\nAround this time, the band's lineup began to dissolve as well. First, Chuck Biscuits left the band in the summer of 1994 due to royalty disagreements. According to a special issue of ''[[Kerrang!]]'', former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] turned down an approach by the band. Biscuits was replaced by [[Joey Castillo]], who made his first public appearance as a member of Danzig at an in-store signing the day of the fourth album's release. Coincidentally, Castillo would later replace Grohl in [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. Although the band had toured successfully with its new drummer during the fall and winter of 1994-95, by the spring of 1995 Danzig was actively seeking a new guitarist, with [[Pepper Keenan]] and [[Dez Cadena]] considered possible replacements.<ref name=\"Seconds\">{{cite web|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=marticle&f=seconds.97|title=Glenn Danzig|first1=Steven |last1=Blush |authorlink1=Steven Blush|date=October 1997|publisher=[[Seconds (magazine)|Seconds]]|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref> John Christ and Eerie Von resigned on July 5, 1995.\n\n=== Post-original lineup-era (1995\u20131999) ===\nIn October 1996, ''Danzig 5: [[Blackacidevil]]'' was released. The album was mostly a solo effort by Danzig, although [[Jerry Cantrell]] of [[Alice in Chains]] played lead guitar on three of the album's tracks. [[Joey Castillo]] played drums, the sole member still in the band from the 4p Tour. Castillo would record on two more Danzig albums, making him the longest-standing member outside of the original lineup.\n\nFor the next few years, Danzig was tied up in a legal battle with Rubin over the rights to unreleased material the band recorded for American Recordings. In November 1999, Danzig ''[[6:66 Satan's Child]]'' was released. A long-planned Samhain box set was also released, followed by a Samhain reunion tour. Samhain opened for Danzig for six weeks during the tour and consisted of Steve Zing and London May switching between bass and drums.\n\n===Later years (2000\u20132005)===\nBy 2000, Danzig's line up had stabilized with the addition of guitarist [[Todd Youth]] and bassist [[Howie Pyro]], both veterans of the New York City punk scene. In 2002, this line up released the album ''Danzig 777: [[I Luciferi]]''. In 2004, Danzig released their eighth studio album, ''[[Circle of Snakes]]'', with the line up featuring [[Tommy Victor]] of [[Prong (band)|Prong]] on guitar, who had toured as a member of Danzig years earlier.\n\nSoon after the album's release, Danzig undertook the Blackest of the Black tour across the United States, replacing ''Circle of Snakes'' drummer Bevan Davies with [[Johnny Kelly]] (of [[Type O Negative]]).\n\n=== (2006\u20132009) ===\nThroughout 2006, Glenn Danzig stated in several interviews that he had grown tired of the touring cycle, and did not expect to partake in any more large-scale tours. Instead, Danzig would go on small, localized tours, such as the ten west coast dates they played for the 2006 Blackest of the Black tour. This tour debuted [[Kenny Hickey]] (of [[Type O Negative]]) as the band's new guitarist, while the East Coast dates saw the addition of former [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] member, [[Steve Zing]] on bass.\n\nIn October 2006, Glenn Danzig released ''[[Black Aria II]]'', the follow-up to his solo classical album, ''[[Black Aria]]''. ''Black Aria'' was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. He spent the rest of the year completing the production and packaging of ''[[The Lost Tracks of Danzig]]'', a double CD containing twenty-six unreleased songs that span the entire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007. Danzig has also stated that he plans to record a dark blues album with either [[Jerry Cantrell]] or [[Hank Williams III]].<ref name=\"ultimate-guitar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/glenn_danzig_talks_20th_anniversary_tour_future_plans.html |title=Glenn Danzig Talks 20th Anniversary Tour, Future Plans &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, Glenn Danzig announced that Danzig (the band) would do a 20th anniversary tour, celebrating the release of their self-titled debut album.

On the first day of the festival, Danzig headlined the Pepsi Max stage.

By 1992, Rubin's involvement with the band had waned. Danzig himself took credit for co-producing the third album, ''[[Danzig III: How the Gods Kill]]''. In the following year, the band released the ''[[Thrall: Demonsweatlive]]'' EP, which contained several live tracks from the band's 1992 Halloween show as well as three new studio tracks. The live version of \"[[Mother (Danzig song)|Mother]],\" a song from the first album, became popular on hard rock radio stations. A new version of the \"Mother\" music video was created using live footage, and the video became a hit on [[MTV]] as well.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nOn October 4, 1994, ''[[Danzig 4]]'' was released. The album sold well, but did not contain a hit on par with the \"Mother\" single. The album's second single, \"Cantspeak\", was also a staple in MTV's rotation, but unlike \"Mother\" failed to appear on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"Cantspeak\" is the band's only single other than \"Mother\" to chart on Billboard. Amid accusations of unpaid royalties and broken promises, Danzig's relationship with Rubin deteriorated, and the band left the record label.\n\nAround this time, the band's lineup began to dissolve as well. First, Chuck Biscuits left the band in the summer of 1994 due to royalty disagreements. According to a special issue of ''[[Kerrang!]]'', former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] turned down an approach by the band. Biscuits was replaced by [[Joey Castillo]], who made his first public appearance as a member of Danzig at an in-store signing the day of the fourth album's release. Coincidentally, Castillo would later replace Grohl in [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. Although the band had toured successfully with its new drummer during the fall and winter of 1994-95, by the spring of 1995 Danzig was actively seeking a new guitarist, with [[Pepper Keenan]] and [[Dez Cadena]] considered possible replacements.<ref name=\"Seconds\">{{cite web|url=http://misfitscentral.com/display.php?t=marticle&f=seconds.97|title=Glenn Danzig|first1=Steven |last1=Blush |authorlink1=Steven Blush|date=October 1997|publisher=[[Seconds (magazine)|Seconds]]|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref> John Christ and Eerie Von resigned on July 5, 1995.\n\n=== Post-original lineup-era (1995\u20131999) ===\nIn October 1996, ''Danzig 5: [[Blackacidevil]]'' was released. The album was mostly a solo effort by Danzig, although [[Jerry Cantrell]] of [[Alice in Chains]] played lead guitar on three of the album's tracks. [[Joey Castillo]] played drums, the sole member still in the band from the 4p Tour. Castillo would record on two more Danzig albums, making him the longest-standing member outside of the original lineup.\n\nFor the next few years, Danzig was tied up in a legal battle with Rubin over the rights to unreleased material the band recorded for American Recordings. In November 1999, Danzig ''[[6:66 Satan's Child]]'' was released. A long-planned Samhain box set was also released, followed by a Samhain reunion tour. Samhain opened for Danzig for six weeks during the tour and consisted of Steve Zing and London May switching between bass and drums.\n\n===Later years (2000\u20132005)===\nBy 2000, Danzig's line up had stabilized with the addition of guitarist [[Todd Youth]] and bassist [[Howie Pyro]], both veterans of the New York City punk scene. In 2002, this line up released the album ''Danzig 777: [[I Luciferi]]''. In 2004, Danzig released their eighth studio album, ''[[Circle of Snakes]]'', with the line up featuring [[Tommy Victor]] of [[Prong (band)|Prong]] on guitar, who had toured as a member of Danzig years earlier.\n\nSoon after the album's release, Danzig undertook the Blackest of the Black tour across the United States, replacing ''Circle of Snakes'' drummer Bevan Davies with [[Johnny Kelly]] (of [[Type O Negative]]).\n\n=== (2006\u20132009) ===\nThroughout 2006, Glenn Danzig stated in several interviews that he had grown tired of the touring cycle, and did not expect to partake in any more large-scale tours. Instead, Danzig would go on small, localized tours, such as the ten west coast dates they played for the 2006 Blackest of the Black tour. This tour debuted [[Kenny Hickey]] (of [[Type O Negative]]) as the band's new guitarist, while the East Coast dates saw the addition of former [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] member, [[Steve Zing]] on bass.\n\nIn October 2006, Glenn Danzig released ''[[Black Aria II]]'', the follow-up to his solo classical album, ''[[Black Aria]]''. ''Black Aria'' was re-released by Evilive in May 2007. He spent the rest of the year completing the production and packaging of ''[[The Lost Tracks of Danzig]]'', a double CD containing twenty-six unreleased songs that span the entire Danzig catalog, which was released on July 10, 2007. Danzig has also stated that he plans to record a dark blues album with either [[Jerry Cantrell]] or [[Hank Williams III]].<ref name=\"ultimate-guitar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/glenn_danzig_talks_20th_anniversary_tour_future_plans.html |title=Glenn Danzig Talks 20th Anniversary Tour, Future Plans &#124; News @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2008, Glenn Danzig announced that Danzig (the band) would do a 20th anniversary tour, celebrating the release of their self-titled debut album.

After pressure from representatives from American Recordings, who did not want to release an unlabeled album for fear that sales would plummet, Danzig relented and allowed a sticker reading \"Danzig 4\" to be placed on the album's [[cellophane]] wrapper in both the vinyl and CD formats. To the right of the \"4\" is a tiny uppercase letter \"P\", in reference to the Four P movement. The following information was supplied by American Recordings in 1994:\n\n<blockquote>''\"The Four P movement is an alleged Satanic cult operating throughout the United States. An offshoot of the notorious [[The Process Church of The Final Judgment|Process Church of the Final Judgment]], the Four P movement takes its name from the Process' original sigil: a [[swastika]]-like form composed of four interlocking [[P]]s. The Four P movement was supposedly begun in 1967, and has been connected to a number of ritual killings across the country, including the [[Son of Sam]] killings in New York and the [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Manson Family]] murders in California.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/article4.htm|title=4p|last=Rogers|first=Steve|date=November 15, 1994|publisher=[[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]|accessdate=2013-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017175110/http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/article4.htm|archive-date=October 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn interviews the band members themselves usually refer to the album simply as ''Danzig 4'', which is printed on the CD itself, the inlay spine, and the labels on the vinyl LP.

According to an interview with Glenn Danzig, the track is titled \"Invocation\" and is \"about a demon fucking somebody.\"<ref name=\"Musician2\"/> The song is inspired by a [[black mass]] Danzig claims to have heard at the ''Magickal Childe'' occult emporium in New York.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/metal_hammer2_dec.jpg|title=The Dark Knight Returns|date=December 2002|magazine=[[Metal Hammer]]|accessdate=2013-03-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017204813/http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/metal_hammer2_dec.jpg|archive-date=2011-10-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Invocation\" includes a [[Gregorian chant]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304052,00.html|title=4|last=Browne|first=David|date=October 14, 1994|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2010-08-02}}</ref> and instrumental tracks that are unique to the song, but reversed, as is Glenn Danzig's spoken introduction: \"All right, let's hear it back\".

CD players that display the \"current track number\" and \"total disc time elapsed\" in minutes thus read ''66&nbsp;&nbsp;61:38'' on the display as the final track starts. This is perhaps an intentional reference to [[The Number of the Beast]] and the song \"[[We Are 138]]\" that Danzig wrote during his days in the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]. \"Invocation\" is not included on the cassette or vinyl versions of the album.\n\nAlthough the songs \"Crucifixion Destruction\" and \"White Devil Rise\" were mentioned in interviews and articles throughout 1994, with Danzig even discussing the latter in some detail, neither song was included on the final version of the album. Along with another outtake from the same sessions, \"The Mandrake's Cry\", these were finally released in 2007 on the first disc of ''[[The Lost Tracks of Danzig]]'' (with \"Crucifixion Destruction\" under its correct title, \"Satan's Crucifiction\").\n\n==Album title==\nIn various 1994-95 interviews, Danzig explained that he did not wish to give the album a title, as he felt that a logo or printing would ruin the artwork, which he wished to stand on its own. After pressure from representatives from American Recordings, who did not want to release an unlabeled album for fear that sales would plummet, Danzig relented and allowed a sticker reading \"Danzig 4\" to be placed on the album's [[cellophane]] wrapper in both the vinyl and CD formats. To the right of the \"4\" is a tiny uppercase letter \"P\", in reference to the Four P movement. The following information was supplied by American Recordings in 1994:\n\n<blockquote>''\"The Four P movement is an alleged Satanic cult operating throughout the United States. An offshoot of the notorious [[The Process Church of The Final Judgment|Process Church of the Final Judgment]], the Four P movement takes its name from the Process' original sigil: a [[swastika]]-like form composed of four interlocking [[P]]s. The Four P movement was supposedly begun in 1967, and has been connected to a number of ritual killings across the country, including the [[Son of Sam]] killings in New York and the [[Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|Manson Family]] murders in California.\"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/article4.htm|title=4p|last=Rogers|first=Steve|date=November 15, 1994|publisher=[[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]|accessdate=2013-11-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017175110/http://www.the7thhouse.com/news/Articles/article4.htm|archive-date=October 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn interviews the band members themselves usually refer to the album simply as ''Danzig 4'', which is printed on the CD itself, the inlay spine, and the labels on the vinyl LP.

The term 'torus' was derived due to the biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment. Due to genetic similarities and replication behavior, in 1992, the Torovirus has been included in the Coronaviridae family. Various envelope genes and the enzymes like polymerase in the Toroviruses and Coronaviruses can be ancestrally related to the common predecessor. Hence the nomenclature of the Torovirus constituents like proteins and mRNAs and other structures has been derived from the family Coronaviridae. However, varying structural components and diversity in the molecular sequences in genomes of Torovirus put them in a separate genus.

Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral S protein (maybe also HE if present) to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive-stranded RNA-virus transcription, using the premature termination model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. Cattle, pig, and horse serve as the natural host. Transmission is thought to be via the [[faecal-oral route]].<ref name=ViralZone />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !!

The term 'torus' was derived due to the biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment. Due to genetic similarities and replication behavior, in 1992, the Torovirus has been included in the Coronaviridae family. Various envelope genes and the enzymes like polymerase in the Toroviruses and Coronaviruses can be ancestrally related to the common predecessor. Hence the nomenclature of the Torovirus constituents like proteins and mRNAs and other structures has been derived from the family Coronaviridae. However, varying structural components and diversity in the molecular sequences in genomes of Torovirus put them in a separate genus. Currently, the international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) recognize four species in the genus Torovirus, namely EToV, BToV, PToV, and HToV. <ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7157456/#s0015title</ref>\n\n==Clinical signs and diagnosis==\nIn cattle, the disease causes [[diarrhoea]] and systemic signs such as [[pyrexia]], [[lethargy]] and anorexia.
