The [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] plane PK-GNJ was hijacked on a [[domestic flight]] and forced to land at [[Don Mueang International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. The hijackers demanded the release of their confederates from Indonesian jails and issued other demands. Three days later, the aircraft was stormed by [[Kopassus|Indonesian special forces]]. In the ensuing gunfire, the pilot, one of the Kopassus operative and and three hijackers were killed, while all passengers were rescued.\n\n==Incident==\nThe McDonnell Douglas DC-9, named \"Woyla\", was scheduled to take off from [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II Airport]] in [[Palembang]], [[South Sumatra]], on Saturday morning, 28 March 1981. The pilot was Captain Herman Rante. The plane departed [[Kemayoran Airport]] in [[Jakarta]] at 08:00 and was scheduled to arrive at [[Polonia International Airport]] in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], at 10:55. After take-off, five men with [[revolvers]] stood up from their seats. Some pointed their guns at the pilot, while others patrolled the aisle, monitoring passengers. They demanded the pilot fly to [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]], but the plane did not have enough fuel, so they refueled at [[Penang International Airport]] in [[Bayan Lepas]], [[Malaysia]]. When they were refueling, the hijackers removed an old lady named Hulda Panjaitan from the plane because she kept crying. Subsequently, the plane took off and landed at Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok. Once there, the hijackers read out their demands. The primary demand was the release of 80 individuals recently imprisoned in Indonesia following the \"Cicendo Event\" two weeks earlier, where Islamists attacked a police station in the Cicendo sub-district of [[Bandung]]. The hijackers also demanded US$1.5 million, that [[Adam Malik]] be suspended from the post of [[Vice President of Indonesia]], and that every [[Israelis|Israeli]] be deported from Indonesia. They also specified the release of one of their comrades at a secret location. The hijackers told Thai police to deliver their demands to the Indonesian government, and threatened to blow up the plane with all the passengers and crew aboard if their demands were not met.\n\nThe Deputy Commander of the Armed Forces, Admiral Sudomo, immediately ordered the [[Indonesian Army]]'s [[Kopassus]], to conduct a [[counter-terrorist]] raid to rescue the hostages. The commandos borrowed a McDonnell Douglas from Garuda Indonesia that was similar to the hijacked plane for three days to rehearse a [[Raid (military)|raid]]. The team was armed with new weapons, including [[Heckler & Koch MP5]]s. They set off for Thailand using a Garuda Indonesia [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]. On Monday, 31 March 1981, the team was ready, but the [[Thai government]] did not give permission for Indonesian forces to take over the aircraft as it was on Thai territory. In desperation, the Indonesian Strategic Intelligence Chief [[Benny Moerdani]] contacted a friend at the [[CIA]] station in Bangkok to persuade the Thai government to give permission.\n\nThe Thai government finally approved the raid with the assistance of the [[Royal Thai Air Force Security Force Regiment]] (SFR). On Tuesday, 31 March, the team began the [[Hostage Rescue|hostage-rescue operation]], dividing themselves into three groups: Red Team, Blue Team, and Green Team. The Red and Blue teams were to be at the plane's rear while the Green team was to enter from the back door of the plane. Members of the Thai SFR team were positioned on the [[Airport apron|tarmac]] in the event hijackers tried to escape. When the Kopassus team entered the plane, the hijackers were surprised and fired at the team, but three of the hijackers were killed when the team returned fire. One of the Kopassus commandos was shot, probably by his comrades, as was the pilot. The hostages were released unharmed. Two of the hijackers surrendered to Thai commandos, but they were killed by the Kopassus commandos on the plane taking them back to Jakarta.<ref name=Conboy>{{cite book |author=Ken Conboy |title=Kopassus: Inside Indonesia's Special Forces |year=2004 |publisher=Equinox Publishing |isbn=979-95898-8-6 |pages=277\u2013278}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath== \nAchmad Kirang, the wounded Kopassus team member who was shot in the [[abdomen]], died the following day on 1 April 1981 at [[Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital]] in Bangkok. Captain Herman Rante, the plane's pilot who was shot in the [[crossfire]], also died in Bangkok a few days later. Kirang and Rante's remains were transported from Bangkok to Jakarta, where they were both later interred in [[Kalibata Heroes Cemetery]].\n\nThe entire Kopassus team, including leader Lieutenant Colonel Sintong Panjaitan, were awarded the Bintang Sakti by the Indonesian government and were [[promoted]].

It successfully drove the UN forces out of North Korea, but its own offensive into the South itself was repelled. The participation of the PVA strained relations between South Korea and China. The Korean War concluded in July 1953, resulting in the establishment of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], and the eventual withdrawal of Chinese forces from the Korean Peninsula. US troops though have remained in South Korea to this day.\n\n===Cold War===\nThroughout the [[Cold War]], there were no official relations between the PRC and ROK. The PRC maintained close relations with [[North Korea]], and South Korea maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China in [[Taiwan]]. This hindered trade between Seoul and Beijing, because South Korea was unable to protect its citizens and business interests in China without some form of international agreements. Beijing's economic needs involving South Korea were initially eclipsed by those of [[Moscow]].{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2019}}<!-- what do you mean by \"eclipsed by those of Moscow\"? -->\n\n====Relations under Park and Chun (1961\u20131988)====\nPresident [[Park Chung-hee]] initiated and President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] advanced a policy of establishing relations with China and the [[Soviet Union]], and attempting to improve those with [[North Korea]]. China and the USSR had significant sway in determining the future of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Good relations with old allies of North Korea were therefore integral to the [[Nordpolitik]] policy.\n\n[[Seoul]]'s official contact with Beijing started by the landing of a hijacked [[CAAC Flight 296]] in May 1983. China sent a delegation of thirty-three officials to Seoul to negotiate its return. This marked the beginning of a series of casual exchanges of citizens. For example, in March 1984, a South Korean tennis team visited [[Kunming]] for a [[1984 Davis Cup#Eastern Zone|Davis Cup]] match with a Chinese team. In April 1984, a thirty-four-member Chinese basketball team arrived in Seoul to participate in the Eighth Asian Junior Basketball Championships. Some Chinese officials reportedly paid quiet visits to South Korea to inspect its industries, while South Korean officials visited China to attend a range of international conferences.\n\n====Late 1980s====\nActive South Korean-Chinese individual contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists, and particularly families divided between South Korea and China were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Significant numbers of citizens of each country reside in the other. {{Asof|2009}}, more than 600,000 [[Chinese people in Korea|PRC citizens reside in South Korea]], of whom 70% are [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] from the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in China's [[Jilin Province]] and other parts of China, while roughly 560,000 South Korean citizens lived in China.<ref name=\"BBG\">{{citation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=ahEY6TmQOzIc&refer=home|periodical=Bloomberg L.P.|title=South Koreans Quit China as Yuan's Gain Raises Cost of Living|last=Kim|first=Kyoungwha|date=2009-01-09|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref><ref name=\"ChosunIlbo20090806\">{{citation|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-10-18|title=More Than 1 Million Foreigners Live in Korea|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/08/06/2009080600243.html}}</ref>\n\nHowever, during this period significant barriers to strong trade and relations persisted. The absence of any protections granted by official relations had still remained. Beijing has been politically closer to Pyongyang, and relations with North Korea remained tense and distrustful.\n\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] Pyongyang publicly supported of Beijing's actions. Seoul, on the other hand, did not condone or condemn the actions in Tiananmen Square.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Post Cold War and Reform and Opening Up==\nTrade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, especially after the PRC's [[reform and opening up]]. Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the US; between North Korea and Japan; and also initiated and promoted tripartite talks\u2014between Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington.<ref>Zhao, Quansheng. \"China and the Korean Peace Process.\" In the Korean Peace Processand the Four Powers.

On August 24, 1992 formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing.

It successfully drove the UN forces out of North Korea, but its own offensive into the South itself was repelled. The participation of the PVA strained relations between South Korea and China. The Korean War concluded in July 1953, resulting in the establishment of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], and the eventual withdrawal of Chinese forces from the Korean Peninsula. US troops though have remained in South Korea to this day.\n\n===Cold War===\nThroughout the [[Cold War]], there were no official relations between the PRC and ROK. The PRC maintained close relations with [[North Korea]], and South Korea maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China in [[Taiwan]]. This hindered trade between Seoul and Beijing, because South Korea was unable to protect its citizens and business interests in China without some form of international agreements. Beijing's economic needs involving South Korea were initially eclipsed by those of [[Moscow]].{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2019}}<!-- what do you mean by \"eclipsed by those of Moscow\"? -->\n\n====Relations under Park and Chun (1961\u20131988)====\nPresident [[Park Chung-hee]] initiated and President [[Chun Doo-hwan]] advanced a policy of establishing relations with China and the [[Soviet Union]], and attempting to improve those with [[North Korea]]. China and the USSR had significant sway in determining the future of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. Good relations with old allies of North Korea were therefore integral to the [[Nordpolitik]] policy.\n\n[[Seoul]]'s official contact with Beijing started by the landing of a hijacked [[CAAC Flight 296]] in May 1983. China sent a delegation of thirty-three officials to Seoul to negotiate its return. This marked the beginning of a series of casual exchanges of citizens. For example, in March 1984, a South Korean tennis team visited [[Kunming]] for a [[1984 Davis Cup#Eastern Zone|Davis Cup]] match with a Chinese team. In April 1984, a thirty-four-member Chinese basketball team arrived in Seoul to participate in the Eighth Asian Junior Basketball Championships. Some Chinese officials reportedly paid quiet visits to South Korea to inspect its industries, while South Korean officials visited China to attend a range of international conferences.\n\n====Late 1980s====\nActive South Korean-Chinese individual contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists, and particularly families divided between South Korea and China were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Significant numbers of citizens of each country reside in the other. {{Asof|2009}}, more than 600,000 [[Chinese people in Korea|PRC citizens reside in South Korea]], of whom 70% are [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] from the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in China's [[Jilin Province]] and other parts of China, while roughly 560,000 South Korean citizens lived in China.<ref name=\"BBG\">{{citation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=ahEY6TmQOzIc&refer=home|periodical=Bloomberg L.P.|title=South Koreans Quit China as Yuan's Gain Raises Cost of Living|last=Kim|first=Kyoungwha|date=2009-01-09|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref><ref name=\"ChosunIlbo20090806\">{{citation|periodical=Chosun Ilbo|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2009-10-18|title=More Than 1 Million Foreigners Live in Korea|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/08/06/2009080600243.html}}</ref>\n\nHowever, during this period significant barriers to strong trade and relations persisted. The absence of any protections granted by official relations had still remained. Beijing has been politically closer to Pyongyang, and relations with North Korea remained tense and distrustful.\n\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] Pyongyang publicly supported of Beijing's actions. Seoul, on the other hand, did not condone or condemn the actions in Tiananmen Square.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Post Cold War and Reform and Opening Up==\nTrade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, especially after the PRC's [[reform and opening up]]. Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the US; between North Korea and Japan; and also initiated and promoted tripartite talks\u2014between Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington.<ref>Zhao, Quansheng. \"China and the Korean Peace Process.\" In the Korean Peace Processand the Four Powers.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], Congress (O), The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasants and farmers. The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira, and the trio stood to prevent that. Indira's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Indira and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, Jayaprakash Narayan.

Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Indira, and the trio stood to prevent that. Indira's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.
