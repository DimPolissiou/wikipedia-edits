Stereotypes of [[East Asian people|East Asians]], like other ethnic stereotypes, are often portrayed in the mainstream media, cinema, music, television, literature, internet, and other forms of creative expression in American culture and society. These stereotypes have been largely and collectively internalized by society and have mainly negative repercussions for Americans of East Asian descent and East Asian immigrants in daily interactions, current events, and government legislation.<ref name=\"vanishing\"/><ref name=\"felicia\"/> Media portrayals of East Asians often reflect an [[Americentric]] perception rather than realistic and authentic depictions of true cultures, customs and behaviors.<ref name=\"vanishing\">{{Citation |last=Kashiwabara |first=Amy |url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Amydoc.html |title=Vanishing Son: The Appearance, Disappearance, and Assimilation of the Asian-US Man in US Mainstream Media |publisher=UC Berkeley Media Resources Center}}</ref> In the past, East Asian Americans have experienced [[discrimination]] and have been victims of [[hate crime]]s related to their ethnic stereotypes, as it has been used to reinforce [[xenophobia|xenophobic sentiments]].<ref name=\"vanishing\"/><ref name=\"sfgate\"/>\n\n==Exclusion or hostility==\n===Yellow Peril===\n[[File:YellowTerror.jpg|thumb|1899 editorial cartoon with caption: \"The Yellow Terror in all his glory.\"]]\n{{Main|Yellow Peril}}\n\nThe term \"Yellow Peril\" refers to [[White American|white]] apprehension, peaking in the late 19th-century, that the European inhabitants of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]] would be displaced by a massive influx of East Asians; who would fill the nation with a foreign culture and speech incomprehensible to those already there and steal jobs away from the European inhabitants and that they would eventually take over and destroy their civilization, ways of life, culture and values. The term has also referred to the belief and fear that East Asian societies would invade and attack Western societies, wage war with them and lead to their eventual destruction, demise and eradication. During this time, numerous anti-Asian sentiments were expressed by politicians and writers, especially on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], with headlines like \"The 'Yellow Peril'\" (''Los Angeles Times'', 1886) and \"Conference Endorses Chinese Exclusion\" (''The New York Times'', 1905)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1905/12/09/archives/conference-indorses-chinese-exclusion-editor-poon-chu-says-china.html |title=Conference Indorses Chinese Exclusion; Editor Poon Chu Says China Will... \u2013 Article Preview \u2013 The |work=New York Times |date= December 9, 1905|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref> and the later Japanese Exclusion Act.

The model minority construct is typically measured by level of educational attainment, representation in [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] [[professional]] and managerial occupations, and household income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmhc.utexas.edu/modelminority.html#what|title=Model Minority Stereotype|website=cmhc.utexas.edu|access-date=2017-02-05}}</ref> Generalized statistics and positive socioeconomic indicators of East Asian Americans are often cited to back up model minority status such as above average educational attainment rates, high representation in professional and managerial occupations such as academia, medicine, investment banking, management consulting, high technology, and law), and a higher household income than other racial groups in the United States as well as other socioeconomic indicators such as low poverty rates, low crime rates, low illegitimacy rates, low rates of welfare dependency, and lower divorce rates and higher family stability. East Asians are most often perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average. However, some East Asian Americans believe the model minority stereotype to be damaging and inaccurate, and are acting to dispel this stereotype.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/290/5494/1072 ASIAN-AMERICAN SCIENTISTS: Silent No Longer: 'Model Minority' Mobilizes \u2013 Lawler 290 (5494): 1072 \u2013 Science].</ref> Some have said that the model minority myth may perpetuate a denial of Asian Americans' racial reality, which happens to also be one of eight themes that emerged in a study of commonly experienced Asian American microaggressions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Many scholars, activists, and most major American news sources have started to oppose this stereotype, calling it a misconception that exaggerates the socioeconomic success of East Asian Americans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stacey J.

Complaints are dismissed by American politicians and other government legislators with the claim that the racism that many East Asian Americans still face is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematically deceptive [[racial hierarchy]]. Believing that due to their socioeconomic success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypical traits, many ordinary Americans assume that East Asian Americans face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in American society at large, and that their community is thriving, having \"gained\" socioeconomic success through their own merit.<ref>{{citation|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 \u2013 Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|accessdate=February 24, 2013|date=July 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|accessdate=February 24, 2013|date=July 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Stereotypes in American fiction==\n[[Fu Manchu]] and [[Charlie Chan]] are two important and well-known fictional East Asian characters in America's cultural history.

In the films, the role of Charlie Chan has usually been played by white actors (namely [[Warner Oland]], [[Sidney Toler]], and [[Roland Winters]]).<ref name=\"imdb\">{{Citation|title=Internet Movie Database&nbsp;\u2014 list of Charlie Chan movies|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0013184/ |publisher=IMDB}}</ref>\n\nIn stark contrast to the Chinese villain Fu Manchu, East Asian American protagonist Charlie Chan represents the American archetype of the \"good\" East Asian.<ref name=\"wu\"/> In ''The House Without a Key'', Earl Derr Biggers describes Charlie Chan in the following manner: \"He was very fat indeed, yet he walked with the light dainty step of a woman. His cheeks were chubby as a baby's, his skin ivory tinted, his black hair close-cropped, his amber eyes slanting.\"<ref name=\"key\">Earl Derr Biggers, ''The House Without a Key'' (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1925), p. 76.</ref> Charlie Chan speaks English with a heavy accent and flawed grammar, and is exaggeratedly polite and apologetic. After one particular racist affront by a Bostonian woman, Chan responds with exaggerated submission, \"Humbly asking pardon to mention it, I detect in your eyes slight flame of hostility. Quench it, if you will be so kind. Friendly co-operation are essential between us.\" Bowing deeply, he added, \"Wishing you good morning.\"<ref name=\"key\"/><!--{I recommend this section be deleted for not being up-to-date.

Many modern critics, particularly Asian-American critics, claim that Charlie Chan has none of the daring, assertive, or romantic traits generally attributed to white fictional detectives of the time,<ref>Kim (1982), 179.</ref> allowing \"white America ...

Even worse, these critics contend, is the common portrayal of the East Asian population as having yellow skin tones (which the critics reference as [[colorism]]). This colorist portrayal negatively contrasts \"colored\" Asian Americans with the European population of North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. East Asians are also stereotyped (or orientalized) as having straight dark (or shiny \"blue\") hair usually styled in a \"bowl cut\" (boys) or with straight overgrown bangs (girls). They are often homogenized as one indiscriminate monolithic conglomeration of cultures, languages, histories, and physiological and behavioral characteristics.

Even worse, these critics contend, is the common portrayal of the East Asian population as having yellow skin tones (which the critics reference as [[colorism]]). This colorist portrayal negatively contrasts \"colored\" Asian Americans with the European population of North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. East Asians are also stereotyped (or orientalized) as having straight dark (or shiny \"blue\") hair usually styled in a \"bowl cut\" (boys) or with straight overgrown bangs (girls). They are often homogenized as one indiscriminate monolithic conglomeration of cultures, languages, histories, and physiological and behavioral characteristics. Almost invariably it is assumed that a person of Asian descent has genetic origins in East Asian countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] or [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nn03oZbkt8C&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=asians+are+stereotyped+as+being+a+homogeneous+group#v=onepage&q=asians%20are%20stereotyped%20as%20being%20a%20homogeneous%20group&f=false |title=Body Politics of the Asian American Woman: From Orientalist Stereotype to the Hybrid Body |author=Jung Heum Whang |date=September 2007 |accessdate=June 26, 2013|isbn=9780549173045 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZXtZ8lFepsC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=immigrant+acts+asian+american+homogeneous+group+lisa+lowe#v=onepage&q=immigrant%20acts%20asian%20american%20homogeneous%20group%20lisa%20lowe&f=false|title=Immigrant Acts: On Asian American Cultural Politics|author=Lisa Lowe|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1996|accessdate=June 26, 2013|isbn=0822318644}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a common assumption that people of Asian descent are all of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Taiwanese descent, in reality the term \"Asian American\" broadly refers to all people who descend from the Asian continental sub-regions of [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] as a whole.

Neville introduced instrumentalists into the cathedral's music who played [[cornett]] and [[sackbut]], probably members of the city's band of waits.

There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this.

With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

In addition to the problems of being itinerant, poor, and far from home and support, plus the hostility of many train crews, they faced the railroads' security staff, nicknamed \"bulls\", who had a reputation of violence against trespassers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Rails |last=Mathers, Michael H.|date=1973|publisher=Gambit|isbn=0-87645-078-8|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30 30]|oclc=757486|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30}}</ref> Moreover, riding on a freight train is dangerous in itself.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198.

The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang. Godfrey Irwin (book review)|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=842|doi=10.1086/215902}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the [[Great Depression|Depression]]) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, no known photos exist showing hobo signs found ''in situ'' where they would have served a practical purpose, leaving open the possibility that all the photographs published were staged in order to add color to the story.\n\nNonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of \"monikers\" (sometimes \"monicas\"). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location.

Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise. An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 (a hobo union created in the mid-1800s to dodge anti-vagrancy laws, which did not apply to union members)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54624/strange-states-iowas-hobo-convention|title=Iowa's Hobo Convention|date=2014-01-21|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> during its 1889 National Hobo Convention:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | title=Hobo Code | publisher=National Hobo Museum | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195757/http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | archivedate=July 24, 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n# Decide your own life; don't let another person run or rule you.\n# When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.\n# Don't take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hobos.\n# Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants.

The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts.  Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or \"railroad days\". Others are quasi-private affairs, hosted by long-time hobos.  Still others are ad hoc\u2014that is, they are held surreptitiously on private land. Some of these conventions are held in abandoned quarries along major rivers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMost non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical [[Train station|railroad stops]]. The most notable is the [[National Hobo Convention]] held in [[Britt, Iowa]].<!--Why most notable?-->{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years. Since 1934 the Convention has been held annually in Britt, on the second weekend in August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54624/strange-states-iowas-hobo-convention |title=Strange States: Iowa's Hobo Convention |last= Lammle |first=Rob |work=[[Mental Floss]] |accessdate=2015-11-01 |date=2014-01-21 }}</ref>\n\n===National Hobo Convention===\n{{essay|section|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe Britt Hobo Museum exhibits a smattering of hobo history and lore. Initially just a \"Hobo Convention\" museum, in the late 1990s it evolved into a fuller Hobo History museum. LeAnn Castillo, a local artist and the hobo painter, exhibits her portrait collection of hobo kings and queens since 1900.  All of her paintings are made from photos.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFormal entertainment at the annual Convention begins before dusk, and is provided by a mix of active hobos, extended hobo families and non-hobo wannabees. Late after dark, the crowd leaves and the campfire becomes more informal. Satellite groups spring up. Stories are told\u2014small and tall, poetry is recited, and cants are sung to the muted vibrations of [[banjo]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[harmonica]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nActivities officially begin the Thursday of the convention weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery to pay tribute to those who have \"Caught the Westbound\", with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five o'clock on Friday afternoon a poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHobo-king candidates are screened the days before the annual King and Queen election and coronation. They are expected to have knowledge and experience in riding trains, and are evaluated for how well they would represent the hobo community. A quasi-qualified candidate is occasionally allowed to run.  Any woman who is part of the hobo community may run for hobo Queen.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} On the Saturday morning there is a parade in the town pavilion, allowing onlookers to see those running for hobo king and queen in a last chance to campaign before the election in the early afternoon. Following the parade, [[Mulligan stew (food)|Mulligan stew]] is served to hundreds of people in the city park, cooked by local [[Boy Scouts]]. In early afternoon, the hobo King and Queen are elected by means of the volume of crowd applause.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA carnival, flea market, and an annual auto show are also part of the festivities. There is also [[stock-car racing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Notable persons==\n\n===Notable hobos===\n* [[Jack Black (author)|Jack Black]]\n* [[Charles Elmer Fox]], author of ''Tales of an American Hobo (Singular Lives)'' (1989) {{ISBN|978-0-87745-251-5}}\n* [[Maurice W.

With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

In addition to the problems of being itinerant, poor, and far from home and support, plus the hostility of many train crews, they faced the railroads' security staff, nicknamed \"bulls\", who had a reputation of violence against trespassers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Rails |last=Mathers, Michael H.|date=1973|publisher=Gambit|isbn=0-87645-078-8|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30 30]|oclc=757486|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30}}</ref> Moreover, riding on a freight train is dangerous in itself.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198.

The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang. Godfrey Irwin (book review)|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=842|doi=10.1086/215902}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the [[Great Depression|Depression]]) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, no known photos exist showing hobo signs found ''in situ'' where they would have served a practical purpose, leaving open the possibility that all the photographs published were staged in order to add color to the story.\n\nNonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of \"monikers\" (sometimes \"monicas\"). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars.<ref name=\":2\">Daniel, Bill.

Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise.

The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts.  Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or \"railroad days\". Others are quasi-private affairs, hosted by long-time hobos.  Still others are ad hoc\u2014that is, they are held surreptitiously on private land. Some of these conventions are held in abandoned quarries along major rivers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMost non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical [[Train station|railroad stops]]. The most notable is the [[National Hobo Convention]] held in [[Britt, Iowa]].<!--Why most notable?-->{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years. Since 1934 the Convention has been held annually in Britt, on the second weekend in August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/54624/strange-states-iowas-hobo-convention |title=Strange States: Iowa's Hobo Convention |last= Lammle |first=Rob |work=[[Mental Floss]] |accessdate=2015-11-01 |date=2014-01-21 }}</ref>\n\n===National Hobo Convention===\n{{essay|section|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe Britt Hobo Museum exhibits a smattering of hobo history and lore. Initially just a \"Hobo Convention\" museum, in the late 1990s it evolved into a fuller Hobo History museum. LeAnn Castillo, a local artist and the hobo painter, exhibits her portrait collection of hobo kings and queens since 1900.  All of her paintings are made from photos.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFormal entertainment at the annual Convention begins before dusk, and is provided by a mix of active hobos, extended hobo families and non-hobo wannabees. Late after dark, the crowd leaves and the campfire becomes more informal. Satellite groups spring up. Stories are told\u2014small and tall, poetry is recited, and cants are sung to the muted vibrations of [[banjo]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[harmonica]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nActivities officially begin the Thursday of the convention weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery to pay tribute to those who have \"Caught the Westbound\", with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five o'clock on Friday afternoon a poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHobo-king candidates are screened the days before the annual King and Queen election and coronation. They are expected to have knowledge and experience in riding trains, and are evaluated for how well they would represent the hobo community. A quasi-qualified candidate is occasionally allowed to run.  Any woman who is part of the hobo community may run for hobo Queen.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} On the Saturday morning there is a parade in the town pavilion, allowing onlookers to see those running for hobo king and queen in a last chance to campaign before the election in the early afternoon. Following the parade, [[Mulligan stew (food)|Mulligan stew]] is served to hundreds of people in the city park, cooked by local [[Boy Scouts]]. In early afternoon, the hobo King and Queen are elected by means of the volume of crowd applause.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA carnival, flea market, and an annual auto show are also part of the festivities. There is also [[stock-car racing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Notable persons==\n\n===Notable hobos===\n* [[Jack Black (author)|Jack Black]]\n* [[Charles Elmer Fox]], author of ''Tales of an American Hobo (Singular Lives)'' (1989) {{ISBN|978-0-87745-251-5}}\n* [[Maurice W.
