Singer [[Tommy Roe]] also scored several hits during the era, including the 1969 number one hit \"[[Dizzy (Tommy Roe song)|Dizzy]]\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe chief characteristics of the genre are that it is pop music contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens and teenagers, is produced in an assembly-line process, is driven by producers, often uses unknown singers, and has an upbeat sound.<ref name=\"naked\"/> The songs typically have singalong choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual [[double entendre]].<ref name=goldmine>{{Cite news| last = Cafarelli| first = Carl| title = An Informal History of Bubblegum Music| newspaper = Goldmine #437| pages = 16\u201376| date = April 25, 1997| postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> Bubblegum songs are also defined as having a catchy [[melody]], simple [[chord (music)|chord]]s, simple [[harmony|harmonies]], [[dance music|dancy]] (but not necessarily danceable) [[beat (music)|beats]], repetitive [[riff]]s or \"[[hook (music)|hook]]s\" and a vocally-multiplied refrain. The song lyrics often feature themes of [[romantic love]] and personal happiness, with references to sunshine, platonic love, toys, colors, nonsense words, etc. They are also notable for their frequent reference to sugary food, including sugar, honey, butterscotch, jelly and marmalade. [[Marketing co-operation|Cross-marketing]] with cereal and bubblegum manufacturers also strengthened the link between bubblegum songs and [[confectionery]]. [[Cardboard record]]s by [[the Archies]], [[the Banana Splits]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[the Monkees]], [[Bobby Sherman]], [[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]], [[H.R. Pufnstuf]] and other acts were included on the backs of cereal boxes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while acts including [[The Brady Bunch]] had their own brands of chewing gum as a result of licensing deals with TV networks and record companies.<ref name=\"naked\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nProducers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] have claimed credit for coining the term ''bubblegum pop'', saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was seized upon by [[Buddah Records]] label executive [[Neil Bogart]]. Music writer and bubblegum historian Bill Pitzonka confirmed the claim, telling ''Goldmine'' magazine: \"That's when bubblegum crystallized into an actual camp. Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized it when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\"<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n==History==\nThe birth of bubblegum is generally dated from the success of [[The Lemon Pipers]]' psychedelic bubblegum hit \"[[Green Tambourine]]\" (1967), [[1910 Fruitgum Company]]'s \"[[Simon Says (1910 Fruitgum Company song)|Simon Says]]\" (1968) and [[The Ohio Express]]' \"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\" (1968), but music critics have identified [[novelty song]]s including  [[The Dixie Cups]]' \"[[Iko Iko]]\" (1965), [[Patti Page]]'s \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\" (1953) and the hits of Annette Funicello as possible precursors.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nA breeding ground for the genre has also been found in the field of 1960s [[garage rock]], the songs of which shared an overriding simplicity with bubblegum. Garage and bubblegum groups were also both generally [[single (music)|singles]] acts. Several garage punk bands, including [[Shadows of Knight]], later recorded bubblegum tracks, while Ohio Express, one of the major 1960s bubblegum bands, began their recording career with punk-rooted tunes.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nBetween those two camps emerged [[Florida]] group [[The Royal Guardsmen]], who scored a US No. 2 hit in 1966 with their novelty hit \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\", and [[The Fifth Estate (band)|The Fifth Estate]], whose 1967 song \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\" reached No. 11 in the US.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n[[Tommy James and the Shondells]] are also seen as a major influence, with such songs as 1964's \"[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]\", 1966's \"It's Only Love\", and 1967's \"[[I Think We're Alone Now]]\" and \"[[Gettin' Together (song)|Gettin' Together]]\", but critics are divided on one possible major bubblegum band prototype: [[The Monkees]]. Although the band began as a prefabricated, fictional rock group concocted to sell records and TV advertising time, the band later wrested creative control from their creators.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\nThe success of the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine\" (US No. 1, February 1968, produced by [[Paul Leka]]) was followed by a wave of bubblegum delivered by the [[Super K Productions]] team of Kasenetz and Katz, who had scored their first hits in 1967 with the [[Music Explosion]]'s \"[[Little Bit O' Soul]]\" (No. 2, May) and [[The Ohio Express]]'s \"Beg, Borrow and Steal\" (No. 29, October).\n\n[[Image:Joey Levine Caravan XV 3684f.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Joey Levine in concert, May 17, 2008]]\nIn early 1968, the pair signed [[New Jersey]] band Jekyll and the Hydes, changed the band's name to 1910 Fruitgum Company, and released two singles that made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] \u2013 \"Simon Says\" (No. 4, February 1968) and \"May I Take a Giant Step (Into Your Heart)\" (No. 63). In May 1968, The Ohio Express (who had also undergone an enforced name change under the Super K team's tutelage, from Sir Timothy and the Royals) also scored a No. 4 hit with \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\".\n\nThe latter, written by early twentysomething [[Joey Levine]] and accomplished songwriter [[Artie Resnick]], was intended as a demo for Ohio Express to emulate, featuring vocals by non-band member Levine and backing by session musicians. The song was released as an Ohio Express single without Levine's knowledge. Two follow-ups, \"Down at Lulu's\" (No. 33, August 1968) and \"Chewy Chewy\" (No. 15, October 1968), also charted \u2013 both featuring vocals by Levine (who had never met the band), and neither featuring any members of Ohio Express. The real Ohio Express toured, supporting [[The Who]] and [[Herman's Hermits]], with bassist Dean Kastran performing the vocals for the hits, emulating Levine's nasal-punk singing style.<ref name=\"naked\" />\n\nKasenetz and Katz developed a strong relationship with [[Buddah Records]], releasing a series of hits by 1910 Fruitgum Company, Ohio Express and one-offs such as \"Quick Joey Small\" by [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]], a Levine-fronted group of studio players. Kasenetz and Katz also scored on [[Bell Records]] in early 1969 with \"[[Gimme Gimme Good Lovin']]\" by another manufactured band, [[Crazy Elephant]].\n\nThe dominance of the Kasenetz\u2013Katz team was challenged in 1969 by music publisher [[Don Kirshner]] and \"Hanky Panky\"'s co-author, [[Brill Building]] writer/producer [[Jeff Barry]].  In early 1967, after almost a year of success directing the music team behind made-for-TV pop band [[The Monkees]], the band rebelled against Kirshner's strict creative controls and after an acrimonious confrontation, involving lawyers and physical violence, wrested control of their career from Kirshner.\n\nA battered and resentful Kirshner envisioned a manufactured group over which he could have permanent and total control: [[Filmation]]'s cartoon band [[The Archies]], based on the [[Archie Comics]] characters. He enlisted Barry and [[Andy Kim]] as songwriters, session musicians including [[Hugh McCracken]], [[Gary Chester]], [[Chuck Rainey]], [[Sal DiTroia]], and Ron Frangipane to provide the music and [[Ron Dante]] and [[Toni Wine]] as vocalists.<ref>email from the late Sal DiTroia, identifying himself and Hugh McCracked as guitarists on \"Sugar, Sugar\"</ref><ref>Liner notes to ''Absolutely the Best of The Archies'' (Fuel 2000, 2001.</ref> Dante, also of [[the Cuff Links]], with whom he scored a No. 9 bubblegum hit, \"[[Tracy (The Cuff Links song)|Tracy]]\", during the same period, would go on later to produce hits for [[Barry Manilow]] in the early 1970s.

Cartoon producers [[Hanna-Barbera]] created [[The Banana Splits]], which made its debut one week before ''[[The Archie Show]]'' in September 1968, for a Saturday morning cartoon show featuring costumed actors miming to pre-recorded tracks \u00e0 la the early Monkees.  Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' was originally developed as cartoon band show, but even after that idea was dropped, the second season in 1970 included seven episodes that each used a different bubblegum song for extended chase scenes with each performed by [[Austin Roberts (singer)|Austin Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Scooby-Doos-Snack-Tracks-The-Ultimate-Collection/release/3375064|publisher=[[Discogs]]|title=Scooby-Doo's Snack Tracks: The Ultimate Collection}}</ref> Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' became the studio's new cartoon band show.\n\nOther animated acts featuring bubblegum music included [[Filmation]]'s ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'', and ''[[Groovie Goolies]]'', ''Sugar Bears'', and (in the UK) ''[[The Wombles]]''.  The all-simian bubblegum band [[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp#The Evolution Revolution|Evolution Revolution]] appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'' from 1970 to 1972 featuring vocals by Steve Hoffman, and studio musicians from [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]] providing backup on their sole LP release.\n\n[[Sesame Workshop]], then called Children's Television Workshop, also jumped on the bubblegum bandwagon, first with a muppet group called \"Little Jerry and the Monotones\" on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in its second season, and then with a juvenile group called \"The Short Circus\" from its new series, ''[[The Electric Company]]'', who would also double as kid cast members in various sketches in the show.\n\nThe initial era of bubblegum carried on into the early 1970s, with hits from [[The Cowsills]],  [[The Partridge Family]] (a made-for-TV group inspired by the real-life Cowsills, starring [[Shirley Jones]] and featuring [[David Cassidy]]), [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Osmonds]], [[The DeFranco Family]] featuring [[Tony DeFranco]] and others. Many [[United Kingdom|British]] acts of the first [[glam rock]] era (approximately 1971\u201375) also incorporated bubblegum influences,<ref name=\"goldmine\" /> including [[Gary Glitter]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and such [[Nicky Chinn]]/[[Mike Chapman]]-produced acts as [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], and American expatriate [[Suzi Quatro]]. These acts had great success in the UK, Asia, Europe and Australia, charting many singles. They were less successful in the US, however. One English bubblegum-pop singer who did achieve transcontinental success was session singer [[Tony Burrows]], but never under his own name: every hit on which Burrows sang lead was credited to a different group (among them White Plains, Edison Lighthouse, The First Class, and The Brotherhood of Man, as well as his novelty recording \"Gimme Dat Ding\" with The Pipkins).\n\nBubblegum had a resurgence, however, and maintained a minor presence on the US charts in the mid-to-late 1970s, particularly through [[Shaun Cassidy]] (David's half-brother) and [[Leif Garrett]], both of whom also maintained television acting careers. The last big act of the 1970s featuring obvious bubblegum elements was the [[Scotland|Scottish]] band the [[Bay City Rollers]], who charted from 1975 through 1978.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sunshine pop]]\n* [[Teenybopper]]\n* [[Bubblegum dance]]\n* [[Teen pop]]\n* [[1960s in music]]\n* [[J-pop]]\n* [[K-pop]]\n* [[Y\u00e9-y\u00e9]]\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref> and </ref> tags, and the template below.\n</nowiki>-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bubblegum-music.com Bubblegum University, a group blog dedicated to bubblegum scholarship]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070608035837/http://home.comcast.net/~bubblegumusic/ The Classic Bubblegum Music Home Page, Bubblegum articles, interviews, history, lyrics, and reviews]\n* [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=Top+Kid+Audio Billboard Top Kid Audio Chart]\n\n{{Pop music}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bubblegum Pop}}\n[[Category:Bubblegum pop| ]]\n[[Category:Pop music genres]]\n[[Category:Rock music genres]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox music genre <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Music genres -->\n| name              = Bubblegum pop\n| bgcolor           = #87CEEB <!--Please DO NOT CHANGE the background or text color of this infobox without discussion; pop genre infoboxes are to be light blue with black text per Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Music genres task force/Colours. -->\n| color             = black\n| stylistic_origins = {{hlist|[[Pop music|Pop]]|[[pop rock]]|[[garage rock]]|[[novelty song]]s|[[nursery rhyme]]s|[[children's music]]|[[comedy music]]}}\n| cultural_origins  = Mid- to late 1960s, United States\n| instruments       = {{hlist|[[Vocals]]|[[synthesizer]]|[[bass guitar]]|[[drum machine]]|[[drums]]|[[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]|[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]|[[guitar]]}}\n| derivatives       = {{hlist|[[Boy band]]s|[[pop punk]]|[[Europop]]|[[dance-pop]]|[[teen pop]]|[[indie pop]]|[[glam rock]]|[[noise pop]]|[[bubblegum dance]]|[[new wave]]}}\n| subgenrelist      =\n| subgenres         =\n| fusiongenres      =\n| regional_scenes   =\n| other_topics      = {{hlist|[[Eurovision Song Contest]]|[[camp (style)|camp]]|''[[Pop Idol]]''|[[teenybopper]]|[[K-pop]]}}\n}}\n'''Bubblegum pop''' (also known as '''bubblegum music''' or simply '''bubblegum''') is a genre of music with an upbeat sound contrived and marketed to appeal to [[pre-teen]]s and [[teenager]]s, which may be produced in an [[assembly-line]] process, driven by [[music producer|producers]] and often using unknown singers.

Singer [[Tommy Roe]] also scored several hits during the era, including the 1969 number one hit \"[[Dizzy (Tommy Roe song)|Dizzy]]\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe chief characteristics of the genre are that it is pop music contrived and marketed to appeal to pre-teens and teenagers, is produced in an assembly-line process, is driven by producers, often uses unknown singers, and has an upbeat sound.<ref name=\"naked\"/> The songs typically have singalong choruses, seemingly childlike themes and a contrived innocence, occasionally combined with an undercurrent of sexual [[double entendre]].<ref name=goldmine>{{Cite news| last = Cafarelli| first = Carl| title = An Informal History of Bubblegum Music| newspaper = Goldmine #437| pages = 16\u201376| date = April 25, 1997| postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> Bubblegum songs are also defined as having a catchy [[melody]], simple [[chord (music)|chord]]s, simple [[harmony|harmonies]], [[dance music|dancy]] (but not necessarily danceable) [[beat (music)|beats]], repetitive [[riff]]s or \"[[hook (music)|hook]]s\" and a vocally-multiplied refrain. The song lyrics often feature themes of [[romantic love]] and personal happiness, with references to sunshine, platonic love, toys, colors, nonsense words, etc. They are also notable for their frequent reference to sugary food, including sugar, honey, butterscotch, jelly and marmalade. [[Marketing co-operation|Cross-marketing]] with cereal and bubblegum manufacturers also strengthened the link between bubblegum songs and [[confectionery]]. [[Cardboard record]]s by [[the Archies]], [[the Banana Splits]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[the Monkees]], [[Bobby Sherman]], [[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]], [[H.R. Pufnstuf]] and other acts were included on the backs of cereal boxes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while acts including [[The Brady Bunch]] had their own brands of chewing gum as a result of licensing deals with TV networks and record companies.<ref name=\"naked\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nProducers [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeffry Katz]] have claimed credit for coining the term ''bubblegum pop'', saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was seized upon by [[Buddah Records]] label executive [[Neil Bogart]]. Music writer and bubblegum historian Bill Pitzonka confirmed the claim, telling ''Goldmine'' magazine: \"That's when bubblegum crystallized into an actual camp. Kasenetz and Katz really crystallized it when they came up with the term themselves and that nice little analogy. And Neil Bogart, being the marketing person he was, just crammed it down the throats of people. That's really the point at which bubblegum took off.\"<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n==History==\nThe birth of bubblegum is generally dated from the success of [[The Lemon Pipers]]' psychedelic bubblegum hit \"[[Green Tambourine]]\" (1967), [[1910 Fruitgum Company]]'s \"[[Simon Says (1910 Fruitgum Company song)|Simon Says]]\" (1968) and [[The Ohio Express]]' \"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\" (1968), but music critics have identified [[novelty song]]s including  [[The Dixie Cups]]' \"[[Iko Iko]]\" (1965), [[Patti Page]]'s \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\" (1953) and the hits of Annette Funicello as possible precursors.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nA breeding ground for the genre has also been found in the field of 1960s [[garage rock]], the songs of which shared an overriding simplicity with bubblegum. Garage and bubblegum groups were also both generally [[single (music)|singles]] acts. Several garage punk bands, including [[Shadows of Knight]], later recorded bubblegum tracks, while Ohio Express, one of the major 1960s bubblegum bands, began their recording career with punk-rooted tunes.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\nBetween those two camps emerged [[Florida]] group [[The Royal Guardsmen]], who scored a US No. 2 hit in 1966 with their novelty hit \"[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]\", and [[The Fifth Estate (band)|The Fifth Estate]], whose 1967 song \"[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]\" reached No. 11 in the US.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n[[Tommy James and the Shondells]] are also seen as a major influence, with such songs as 1964's \"[[Hanky Panky (Tommy James and the Shondells song)|Hanky Panky]]\", 1966's \"It's Only Love\", and 1967's \"[[I Think We're Alone Now]]\" and \"[[Gettin' Together (song)|Gettin' Together]]\", but critics are divided on one possible major bubblegum band prototype: [[The Monkees]]. Although the band began as a prefabricated, fictional rock group concocted to sell records and TV advertising time, the band later wrested creative control from their creators.<ref name=\"goldmine\" />\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}\nThe success of the Lemon Pipers' \"Green Tambourine\" (US No. 1, February 1968, produced by [[Paul Leka]]) was followed by a wave of bubblegum delivered by the [[Super K Productions]] team of Kasenetz and Katz, who had scored their first hits in 1967 with the [[Music Explosion]]'s \"[[Little Bit O' Soul]]\" (No. 2, May) and [[The Ohio Express]]'s \"Beg, Borrow and Steal\" (No. 29, October).\n\n[[Image:Joey Levine Caravan XV 3684f.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Joey Levine in concert, May 17, 2008]]\nIn early 1968, the pair signed [[New Jersey]] band Jekyll and the Hydes, changed the band's name to 1910 Fruitgum Company, and released two singles that made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] \u2013 \"Simon Says\" (No. 4, February 1968) and \"May I Take a Giant Step (Into Your Heart)\" (No. 63). In May 1968, The Ohio Express (who had also undergone an enforced name change under the Super K team's tutelage, from Sir Timothy and the Royals) also scored a No. 4 hit with \"Yummy Yummy Yummy\".\n\nThe latter, written by early twentysomething [[Joey Levine]] and accomplished songwriter [[Artie Resnick]], was intended as a demo for Ohio Express to emulate, featuring vocals by non-band member Levine and backing by session musicians. The song was released as an Ohio Express single without Levine's knowledge. Two follow-ups, \"Down at Lulu's\" (No. 33, August 1968) and \"Chewy Chewy\" (No. 15, October 1968), also charted \u2013 both featuring vocals by Levine (who had never met the band), and neither featuring any members of Ohio Express. The real Ohio Express toured, supporting [[The Who]] and [[Herman's Hermits]], with bassist Dean Kastran performing the vocals for the hits, emulating Levine's nasal-punk singing style.<ref name=\"naked\" />\n\nKasenetz and Katz developed a strong relationship with [[Buddah Records]], releasing a series of hits by 1910 Fruitgum Company, Ohio Express and one-offs such as \"Quick Joey Small\" by [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]], a Levine-fronted group of studio players. Kasenetz and Katz also scored on [[Bell Records]] in early 1969 with \"[[Gimme Gimme Good Lovin']]\" by another manufactured band, [[Crazy Elephant]].\n\nThe dominance of the Kasenetz\u2013Katz team was challenged in 1969 by music publisher [[Don Kirshner]] and \"Hanky Panky\"'s co-author, [[Brill Building]] writer/producer [[Jeff Barry]].  In early 1967, after almost a year of success directing the music team behind made-for-TV pop band [[The Monkees]], the band rebelled against Kirshner's strict creative controls and after an acrimonious confrontation, involving lawyers and physical violence, wrested control of their career from Kirshner.\n\nA battered and resentful Kirshner envisioned a manufactured group over which he could have permanent and total control: [[Filmation]]'s cartoon band [[The Archies]], based on the [[Archie Comics]] characters.

As a result, most vehicles are right-hand drive. However, exemptions have been made to allow foreign vehicles and construction machineries to utilise the road space of Singapore. As such, vehicles with [[left-hand drive]] configurations are required to either be driven with a sign indicating \"LEFT-HAND-DRIVE\" or towed.\n\nThe per-capita car ownership rate in Singapore is approximately 12 cars per 100 people (or 1 car per 8.25 people).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Geylang Road, Nov 05.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Geylang Road was one of the earliest roads built in Singapore.]]\nThe earliest roads in Singapore, after its [[Founding of modern Singapore|founding]] in 1819, were laid out in the [[Jackson Plan]] of 1822 in keeping with [[Sir Stamford Raffles]]'s directions. A grid system was adopted for the town with roads for [[carriage]]s being {{convert|16|yd}} wide, and those for horses four yards wide. Pedestrian paths along the roadsides were two yards wide, allowing room for two people to walk abreast and giving rise to the [[five-foot way]]s that came to be associated with the sheltered walkways along roadside [[retailing|shops]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThese roads were fairly advanced for the time, with [[Macadam]] surfacing used on High Street as early as 1821. Roads were also constructed across the rest of the island, although they were usually unsurfaced. Most of the roads were accessible to the kampong roads by 1845, and finally to the HDB developed roads since the 1960s. Currently, there are a lot of roads and expressways in Singapore. The first motor car was introduced in Singapore in 1896.\n\nAs with many other urban areas of the time, all the earliest modes of transport were replaced by today's transport.\n\n==Driving licence==\n===Obtaining a driving licence===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:TPbasiceng.gif|right|thumb|Basic Theory of Diving, 7th edition, the official handbook]] -->\n\nA class 3 or class 3A licence permits the holder to drive motorcars weighing less than 3,000&nbsp;kg when unladen and to carry no more than seven passengers.

Once a driver passes the Basic Theory Test (BTT), a Provisional Driving Licence (PDL) which lasts for six months before December 2017, 2 years validity after 1 December 2017, must be applied before taking the practical driving lesson. It is an offence to learn to drive without a valid PDL licence. However, a student can choose to apply and pass the Final Theory Test (FTT) before applying for a PDL and starting driving lessons. The last stage of obtaining a driving licence is the practical driving test, for which a student must have a FTT pass result slip and a valid PDL. Failure to do so will cause the test to be rejected by the Traffic Police Tester.\n\nThe driving theory tests consist of 50 questions to be answered within 50 minutes; to pass, you must answer 45 out of the 50 questions correctly. Results are shown immediately after the test on the same touchscreen monitor.\n\n===Foreign drivers in Singapore===\nThe Singapore Traffic Police require foreigners residing in Singapore to have a valid foreign driver's licence and to be at least 18 years old.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/information_drivinglicence_legal.htm |title=Legal Requirement |access-date=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107014251/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/driving_in_singapore/information_drivinglicence_legal.htm |archive-date=7 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConversion to a Singaporean licence is often possible for certain classes of vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.police.gov.sg/resources/traffic-matters/getting-a-licence/conversion-of-driving-license |title=Conversion of Driving Licence |accessdate=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724112016/https://www.police.gov.sg/resources/traffic-matters/getting-a-licence/conversion-of-driving-license |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nForeigners who have obtained a Singapore licence are supplied with a limited-duration licence which needs to be renewed between one month before expiry to three years after expiry. After this period, the conversion procedure or licensing theory and practical tests must be taken all over again.\n\nAll foreigners visiting or residing in Singapore will need to produce an IDP (International Driving Permit) produced by their home country with an English Driving Licence. The IDP (International Driving Permit) lasts for a year. However, Countries under ASEAN are exempt from carrying an IDP. Foreigners must present both a valid Singapore Driving License and Employment Pass/FIN card with at least 6 months of validity.\n\n===Licence renewal===\nNo renewal of a driving licence is required for Singapore citizens and permanent residents since the introduction of the photocard licence. The driving licence is for the normal lifespan of the person and can be surrendered upon request to the [[Traffic Police]]. If the person passes away, the licence will have to be surrendered to the Traffic Police for cancellation, similar to National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). It is an offence for any persons to continue or to possess or use any other person's identity cards listed above without authorization.\n\nA person who commits 12 demerit points and is above 80 years old is subject to early termination of the driving licence indefinitely. Additionally, no new drivers over 79 years old are accepted. Random medical check-up screenings will be required for those over 62 years old for all drivers that still want to drive.\n\nFor Class 4, 5, bus and taxi driving licences, annual medical check-ups are done from 70 years old all the way to 80. The upper age limit is 81.\n\n===Riding motorcycles registered on a different holder===\nIn Singapore, it is illegal to ride a motorcycle if the rider's name is not entered in the insurance contract. For each motorcycle, only one co-rider can be entered, but the procedure to change the co-rider is comparatively quick and easy. The only exception is commercial insurance, where any rider can use the vehicle. Only a business registered company can register for a commercial insurance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aloride.com/download/Insurance/Certificates/FBF121D.pdf|title=Certificate of Insurance|last=|first=|date=|website=AloRide - Singapore Motorbike Rental|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924093832/https://aloride.com/download/Insurance/Certificates/FBF121D.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Driver Improvement Points System===\nThe Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is a system whereby demerit points will be added to the driver's record. The system is meant to deter drivers from infringing the rules-of-the-road and, if they do, suspend their driving licence for a period of time. This system requires offenders to retest and pass the driving test again from the beginning.\n\nIf a driver accumulates 24 [[demerit point]]s within a period of two years, he/she will be suspended from driving for three months. If he/she had been suspended before, he/she will only be allowed to accumulate less than 12 demerit points in a period of 12 months. It is a driving licence scheme where those foreigners who have their licence suspended will have their licences affected, as this is from other countries. A driving licence is a statutory requirement and is commonly used worldwide.\n\nCurrently, drivers are given demerit points if they commit certain traffic offences such as [[speeding]] and passengers not fastening their [[seat belt]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/dips/about.htm | title=About DIPS |publisher=Singapore Police Force | accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607130508/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/dips/about.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Roads in Singapore==\n===Electronic Road Pricing===\n[[File:027 ERP gantry.jpg|thumb|right|ERP gantry]]\n{{Main|Electronic Road Pricing (Singapore)}}\nThe [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) in Singapore implemented an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme to deter traffic congestion during peak hours at various roads. The ERP scheme requires electronic gantries to be placed over the road at designated locations and that cars be equipped with an In-Vehicle Unit (IU), a rectangular device pasted on the inside bottom right of the front windscreen from the driver's view, which will deduct the toll price from a [[CashCard]]. The CashCard must be inserted into the device, and failure to do so is in violation of the law. There is no charge for entering the area during certain non-peak times.\n\n===Low Emission Zone===\nThe LTA also implemented the Low Emission Zone to deter air pollution at various roads, as part of the change of law.\n*2014: All buses, vans, lorries and minibusses must meet minimum Euro II emissions onwards. All taxis must meet minimum Euro III emissions onwards\n*Late 2017: All buses, vans, lorries and minibusses must meet minimum Euro III emissions onwards. All taxis must meet minimum Euro IV emissions onwards\n\n===Parking===\nThe cost of parking in many upgraded car parks can be deducted from the CashCard inserted in the IU of the vehicle, thus eliminating the need for the car park to have an attendant. Although the cost of parking (which is published) is variable, parking costs tend to be much less expensive compared to London and New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/parking/parking_rates/downtown_rates.html|title=ONE.MOTORING \u2013 Downtown Rates<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=www.onemotoring.com.sg|access-date=27 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510084541/http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/parking/parking_rates/downtown_rates.html|archive-date=10 May 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Centrepoint shopping centre charges a mere S$1 (approximately US$0.70) for the first hour, whereas garages in New York on [[Fifth Avenue]] and 57th Street charge between US$12 and US$26 for one hour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nycgarages.com/ | title=Compare Parking Rates Daily/Monthly Garages Lots | access-date=27 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419093650/http://www.nycgarages.com/ | archive-date=19 April 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSome car parks in Singapore are equipped with sensors that can detect whether the position is filled or not. This information is processed and displayed in signs around the car park, directing drivers to areas where there are free spaces.\n\n\u2018Season Parking\u2019 is an initiative created by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) for motorists to engage in long-term parking of their vehicles in HDB car parks. There are several types of season parking in Singapore.<ref>https://www.motorist.sg/article/457/4-important-know-hows-about-hdb-season-parking</ref>\n\n===Road signs===\n{{Main|Road signs in Singapore}}\nDuring British colonial rule, Singapore's road rules and legislature which govern the design and layout of the road signs were directly imported from Britain. As such, most road signs in Singapore are similar to those in the UK. For example, warning signs are depicted as red triangles and mandatory regulative signs are depicted as blue circles.\n\nHowever, several aspects of road signage and traffic-calming measures adopted locally developed standards after independence. Major deviations are as follows:\n\n1. A locally developed [[typeface]] is favoured for the road signs over the [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]] typeface which was adopted in Britain.\n\n2. In 1998, a system of black-on-yellow \"curve alignment markers\" was widely adopted and gradually replaced the British system of using white-on-black sharp deviation signs to delineate sharp turns. A few of the British-system signs were kept such as in Mandai Road and Suntec City.\n\n3. In the late 1990s, all the circular regulatory signs and triangular warning signs were mounted to a one-size-fits-all square white backing board to improve visibility against a complex background like trees.\n\n4. In the early 2000s, signs at road works were made usually black-on-orange and diamond- or rectangular-shaped, similar to the Taiwanese system.\n\nMost roads, bridges, [[roundabout]]s, and tunnels are marked with signposts bearing the name of the road. The expressways in Singapore are not numbered (unlike in most other countries), but are named. Road signs abbreviate the full name of the expressway with three representative letters, such as '''PIE''' for the '''P'''an '''I'''sland '''E'''xpressway or '''ECP''' for the '''E'''ast '''C'''oast '''P'''arkway, respectively.\n\nAlmost all road signs in Singapore are in English although many road names have a Malay origin. Typically, \"Jalan\" is used for \"Road\" and \"Lorong\" is used for \"Lane\". Multilingual road signs exist, especially for historically ethnic enclaves like Chinatown or Little India, or for landmarks. For example, some directional signs pointing to Chinese or Hindu temples are bilingual or trilingual (English, Chinese, or Tamil). Bilingual signage dates to the early days of Singapore.\n\n5. Curiously enough, even on the larger signs, road names are rarely spelt out in full. For example, \"road\" is almost always \"Rd\" (\"Avenue\" as \"Ave\", \"Bukit\" as \"Bt\", \"Boulevard\" as \"Blvd\", \"Close\" as \"Cl\", \"Central\" as \"Ctrl\", \"Crescent\" as \"Cres\", \"Drive\" as \"Dr\", \"Jalan\" as \"Jln\", \"Kampong\" as \"Kg\", \"Lane\" as \"Ln\", \"Lorong\" as \"Lor\", \"Upper\" as \"Upp\", \"Place\" as \"Pl\", \"Saint\" and \"Street\" as \"St\", \"Tanjong\" as \"Tg\"). Exceptions include roads that end with less common words, such as \"walk\", \"hill\", and \"park\".\n\n===Left turn or right turn at a red traffic light===\n'''Left Turn'''\n\nIn Singapore, it is illegal to turn left (into the nearest lane, due to the left-hand driving) during a red light. This rule, however, does not apply if a \"Left Turn on Red\" sign is present at the junction, allowing left-turning motorists to turn left, provided they stop before the stop line and give way to pedestrians and incoming traffic.\n\n'''Right Turn'''\n\nIt is illegal to turn right during a red light in Singapore.\n\nRight turns are permissible only when one's lane has the green light signal and the opposing traffic lane, travelling in the opposite direction, is clear and favourable to execute a right turn. However, green turning signals (the outline of a right-pointing arrow) are installed onto some traffic lights.\n\nThese rules in Singapore are similar to many countries that employ [[left-hand traffic]], and unlike countries which permit turns on red.\n\n===Special Roads===\nDue to the limited land space in Singapore, selected roads, especially those with more lanes have been specially designated as runways for aircraft in the event of an emergency or when needs arise.\n\n==Traffic safety==\n===Driving safety===\nDriving after consuming alcohol, using a phone while driving, dangerous driving, and car racing are all illegal. All offenders will face disqualification and be prosecuted in court.\n\n===Car safety crash tests===\nThe Singapore government accepts the crash safety standards of the EU and Japan. Cars made in the EU and Japan do not need to pass additional safety standards to be sold in Singapore. Cars may be privately imported into Singapore if they have an EU Certificate of Conformity or the Japanese Completion Inspection Certificate, both of which incorporate emissions and safety standards.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/singapore/how-to/page/singapore-transport-vehicle-ownership-importing-a-vehicle|title=Importing a Foreign Vehicle to Singapore|website=Angloinfo Singapore|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808085648/https://www.angloinfo.com/singapore/how-to/page/singapore-transport-vehicle-ownership-importing-a-vehicle|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Not all cars sold in Singapore have been tested by the [[EuroNCAP]], a car-safety testing organisation jointly operated by several European government agencies,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.euroncap.com/members.aspx |title=Euro NCAP \u2013 For safer cars {{!}}Members<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525002400/http://www.euroncap.com/members.aspx |archive-date=25 May 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that crash tests cars that can be legally sold in several European countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.euroncap.com/testresults.aspx |title=Euro NCAP \u2013 For safer cars {{!}}Test results<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512202929/http://www.euroncap.com/testresults.aspx |archive-date=12 May 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Buying a car==\nMany regulations concerning buying and driving a car are administered by the [[Land Transport Authority]], the successor to the Registry of Vehicles.\n\n===Certificate of Entitlement===\n{{Main|Certificate of Entitlement}}\nNew car buyers are required to buy a [[Certificate of Entitlement]] (COE), which is valid for ten years. The typical car lifespan is 17 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Extension for two or three years of the typical car lifespan is only for those who have special difficulties. Car buyers can scrap the car earlier than the typical car lifespan. The term \"bidding\" is often used, but in practice new car dealers assist in the process. The fee of each COE is added on to the costs of a new car based on engine size\u2014Category A is 1,600 cc engine and below; Category B is 1,601 cc engine and above\u2014and is generally lower for Category A vehicles. There are provisions for a rebate of the COE if the car is scrapped before 10 years.\n\n===Preferential Additional Registration Fee===\nA car owner may apply for a portion of the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) if a car is de-registered before 10 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://singapore.angloinfo.com/countries/singapore/motoregister.asp |title=Registering a Motor Vehicle in Singapore \u2013 AngloINFO Singapore<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=24 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426160549/http://singapore.angloinfo.com/countries/singapore/motoregister.asp |archive-date=26 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The term \"Additional Registration Fee (ARF)\" is calculated from 110% of Open Market Value (OMV).

Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red.\n\n==Car market==\n===Domestic car market===\nCar brands are typically sold by only one dealer although there are rare exceptions where two dealers sell the same brand. Several dealers have more than one location. Some dealers sell more than one brand, unlike the situation in some western European countries in the past where some manufacturers prohibited dealers from selling competing brands. Negotiation during car purchases is customary but limited due to the lack of competing dealers.\n\nThe limited size of the Singapore market results in some brands not offering the full model line in Singapore. Unlike in Australia, where the US [[Honda Accord]] and the Japanese Honda Accord (re-badged as the [[Acura TSX]] in the United States) are sold, only the Japanese Honda Accord is sold in Singapore. Some brands, such as [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] and [[Volvo]] (except the [[Volvo S60R]]) are only offered with [[automatic transmission]] even though [[manual transmission]] cars are sold in the car's home market.\n\nAlthough car prices are high, servicing costs are reasonable compared to in the United States and Western Europe in terms of labour charges.\n\n[[Sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs) and [[pick-up truck]]s are not as common in Singapore as in the United States and Canada. So, pick-up trucks in Singapore are relatively expensive compared to other [[South East Asia|Southeast Asia]]n countries, and some dealerships do not import pick-up trucks like the [[Nissan Frontier|Nissan Navara]] and [[Ford Ranger (international)|Thai-built Ford Ranger]] at all.\n[[File:2016 Toyota Corolla Altis (ZRE172R) 1.6 sedan (2017-11-28).jpg|thumb|right|[[Toyota Corolla (E170)|Toyota Corolla Altis]]]]\nJapanese car manufacturers have the largest market share. Some Japanese cars are imported from countries other than Japan. For example, the [[Toyota Vios]] is imported from [[Thailand]], whereas the [[Japanese Domestic Market|JDM]] version is called [[Toyota Belta]]. Initially, the [[Toyota Corolla (E120)|ninth generation Toyota Corolla]] sold in Singapore was a [[Japanese Domestic Market|Japanese model]], while the facelift version is a wider and longer [[Toyota Corolla (E140)|Corolla Altis]] from Thailand.\n[[File:Subaru R2, facelift, front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Subaru R2]]]]\n[[Kei car]]s (like the [[Mitsubishi i]], [[Subaru R2]], and [[Suzuki Carry]]) are common in Singapore, but not as popular as in [[Japanese domestic market]] as most Japanese car manufacturers seldom release Kei cars in Singapore. Besides this, there are some grey imports of Kei cars like [[Daihatsu Copen]].\n\nEuropean car manufacturers are well represented. On the more expensive segment of the market, European cars sold in Singapore include [[Aston Martin]], [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Bmw]], and others. [[Skoda Auto|Skoda]], [[Fiat]], [[Renault]], [[Peugeot]] and [[Citroen]] are among the less expensive European cars sold in Singapore.\n\nAmerican cars have a low market share. [[Chrysler]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], and [[Jeep]] vehicles are sold in Singapore, such as the [[Chrysler 300]]C, [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]], [[Dodge Caliber]], and [[Jeep Wrangler]]. [[Chevrolet]] markets only Korean-made Daewoo cars, but not its American-made models. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] markets some cars from its European line, not its American product line. Even [[Subaru]], a Japanese carmaker, did not do well with cars made by a US-based subsidiary, [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.|Subaru of Indiana Automotive]], which exported the US-made [[Subaru Tribeca|Tribeca]] to Singapore.\n\nNon-Japanese Asian car brands sold in Singapore include [[Perodua]], [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]], [[Ssangyong]], [[Hafei Motor]], [[Chery]], [[Geely]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Chang'an Motors|Chana]], and [[Holden Special Vehicles]].\n\nUsed cars that are more than three years old cannot be imported into Singapore.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Aftermarket===\nBecause Singapore does not have a domestic automobile industry and thus has a very small ''domestic market'' for remanufactured and reconditioned auto parts, it has become an especially important [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] for businesses exporting automotive parts and accessories. This is magnified by high automobile turnover, a preference for new parts, and high demand for \"accessories, car-care products, prestige items, and new spare parts\". In fact, Singapore has become a major automotive ''components'' manufacturing base, as several leading multinational corporations (MNCs) have established international procurement offices as well as their Southeast Asia distribution centres.<ref name=sing>{{cite web|last=Ng |first=Haw Cheng |title=Singapore: Automobiles and Vehicle Parts & Accessories |url=http://www.aftermarketsuppliers.org/Doc-Vault/OAC/Singapore-Automotive-Report.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Commercial Service]] |date=November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320095812/http://www.aftermarketsuppliers.org/Doc-Vault/OAC/Singapore-Automotive-Report.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Singapore as an automobile exporter===\nThe peculiarities of Singapore's car market has made Singapore the second largest exporter of used cars in the world (approximately 100,000 cars exported per year) after Japan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Singapore exports its cars to many countries, including African countries.

Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's [[depreciation]] costs or financing costs.<ref>[http://www.kiplinger.com/basics/archives/2003/02/buying4.html \"Should You Keep Your Old Car?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504215430/http://www.kiplinger.com/basics/archives/2003/02/buying4.html |date=4 May 2007 }}, ''Kiplinger.com''</ref>\n\n==Left-hand drive Vs Right-hand drive==\nIn Singapore, only right-hand-drive cars are permitted on the roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/lta_information_guidelines/buy_a_new_vehicle/self_importation_.MainPar.22837.File.tmp/Car.pdf&ei=Zbj1U9SsN4ahugSWj4DAAw&usg=AFQjCNHTc_pJsESOog6-rHv936wzuqfI-Q |title=PROCEDURES ON IMPORTATION AND REGISTRATION OF A CAR IN SINGAPORE |publisher=LTA |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407131700/http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/lta_information_guidelines/buy_a_new_vehicle/self_importation_.mainpar.22837.file.tmp/car.pdf%26ei%3Dzbj1u9ssn4ahugswj4daaw%26usg%3Dafqjcnhtc_pjsesoog6-rhv936wzuqfi-q |archive-date=7 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are exceptions for special-purpose vehicles, diplomatic vehicles, and foreign-registered vehicles, with the label placed at the back windscreen of the vehicles indicating \"Left Hand Drive\" to alert other motorists that the driver's seat is on the left side instead of on the right side.\n\n==Petrol market==\n===Retail petrol market===\nIn 2017, there were about 170 petrol stations across the city-state, a decrease from 222 stations in 2013.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/shell-to-end-partnership-with-7-eleven-chain|title=Shell to end partnership with 7-Eleven chain|last=hermes|date=2017-10-02|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Many were closed as they were either deemed a security risk or the license had lapsed.<ref name=\":0\" /> These stations operate under brands of five multinational companies, with no independent retailers.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.cccs.gov.sg/-/media/custom/ccs/files/media-and-publications/publications/market-studies/petrol-final-report-2017/report-on-ccs-market-inquiry-on-retail-petrol.pdf|title=2017 Market Inquiry on Retail Petrol Prices in Singapore|last=|first=|date=19 December 2017|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> The petrol station network is largely operated by four incumbent retailers: [[Royal Dutch Shell]], retailing petrol under the brand \"Shell\", [[ExxonMobil]], retailing petrol under the brand \"[[Esso]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stations.esso.com.sg/en-sg/|title=Petrol Stations - Find a Petrol Station in Singapore - Esso|website=www.stations.esso.com.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], retailing petrol under the brand \"[[Caltex]]\", and [[Singapore Petroleum Company]], retailing petrol under the brand \"SPC\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The incumbent retailers are vertically integrated, with their supplies of refined petrol coming from their refineries situated at Jurong Island.<ref name=\":1\" /> Potential new entrants to the market face high barriers to entry in form of additional premiums paid to acquire retail petrol sites that are planned for by [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA) and tendered out by [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.cccs.gov.sg/-/media/custom/ccs/files/media-and-publications/publications/market-studies/inquiry-into-retail-petrol-market-in-singapore-may-23.pdf|title=An Inquiry Into the Retail Petrol Market Study in Singapore|last=|first=|date=19 May 2011|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> It was also determined that for a viable retail petrol operation in Singapore, a new entrant would need to operate minimally 30 sites, which is hard to achieve at the average rate of 2.4 new tenders per anuum.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2017, [[Sinopec]] won the bids for two retail sites, with the first site coming into operation in November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/china-oil-giant-enters-singapore-petrol-station-business|title=China oil giant enters Singapore petrol station business|last=hermes|date=2017-10-01|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/china-sinopec-singapore-first-overseas-fuel-station-11046398|title=China's Sinopec opens first overseas petrol station in Yishun|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\nFour grades of petrol are commonly sold in Singapore.

A [[Certificate of Entitlement]] (COE) is required, costing more than [[Singapore dollar|S$]]80,000 to successful bidders. This permits ownership of the vehicle for a period of 10 years after which the vehicle must be scrapped or another COE paid for allowing an additional 5 or 10 years of usage. COE is technically a lease at an inflated cost. Only ten-year COEs may be further renewed to another 7\u201310 years and no extension of the car is given. Historic vehicles are exempted from these requirements.\n\nCertain roads and expressways in Singapore are subject to the [[Electronic Road Pricing]] (ERP) system.\n\nCOEs and the ERP system are intended to encourage people to use public transport such as the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] and public buses instead of driving. The increasing parking charges in HDB carparks from 1 December 2016 in electronic parking and selected season parking also deter people from driving and encouraged to take public transport.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of countries by vehicles per capita]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.lta.gov.sg/motoring_matters/index_motoring_vo.htm Land Transport Authority]\n* Schematic drawing of ERP system which uses pair of gantries and 5 step detection sequence [http://www.worldbank.org/transport/utsr/budapest/mar1am/breitanx.pdf]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130803020914/http://tripsum.xeesa.com/ TripSum @ Xeesa.com: 1st online Fuel/ ERP/ Taxi fare calculator] to check and calculate Fuel, ERP and Taxi Fare amount needed for a motorist's driving trip or taxi trip in Singapore\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091227113328/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/drivinglicence/replacement.htm Replacement of Driving Licence]\n\n{{Singapore topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Driving In Singapore}}\n[[Category:Driving by country|Singapore]]\n[[Category:Road transport in Singapore]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:Jln Toa Payoh bef Kim Keat 20060402.JPG|thumb|The [[Pan Island Expressway]], one of the main expressways in the Singapore road network.]]\n{{Life in Singapore}}\n\nIn Singapore, cars and other vehicles drive on the left side of the road\u2014due to its historical rule by the [[United Kingdom]]. As a result, most vehicles are right-hand drive. However, exemptions have been made to allow foreign vehicles and construction machineries to utilise the road space of Singapore. As such, vehicles with [[left-hand drive]] configurations are required to either be driven with a sign indicating \"LEFT-HAND-DRIVE\" or towed.\n\nThe per-capita car ownership rate in Singapore is approximately 12 cars per 100 people (or 1 car per 8.25 people).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Geylang Road, Nov 05.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Geylang Road was one of the earliest roads built in Singapore.]]\nThe earliest roads in Singapore, after its [[Founding of modern Singapore|founding]] in 1819, were laid out in the [[Jackson Plan]] of 1822 in keeping with [[Sir Stamford Raffles]]'s directions. A grid system was adopted for the town with roads for [[carriage]]s being {{convert|16|yd}} wide, and those for horses four yards wide. Pedestrian paths along the roadsides were two yards wide, allowing room for two people to walk abreast and giving rise to the [[five-foot way]]s that came to be associated with the sheltered walkways along roadside [[retailing|shops]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThese roads were fairly advanced for the time, with [[Macadam]] surfacing used on High Street as early as 1821. Roads were also constructed across the rest of the island, although they were usually unsurfaced. Most of the roads were accessible to the kampong roads by 1845, and finally to the HDB developed roads since the 1960s. Currently, there are a lot of roads and expressways in Singapore. The first motor car was introduced in Singapore in 1896.\n\nAs with many other urban areas of the time, all the earliest modes of transport were replaced by today's transport.\n\n==Driving licence==\n===Obtaining a driving licence===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:TPbasiceng.gif|right|thumb|Basic Theory of Diving, 7th edition, the official handbook]] -->\n\nA class 3 or class 3A licence permits the holder to drive motorcars weighing less than 3,000&nbsp;kg when unladen and to carry no more than seven passengers. In addition, the holder may drive a motor tractor or other motor vehicles with an unladen weight of less than 2,500&nbsp;kg. A class 3A licence limits the holder to drive motor vehicles without a clutch pedal, typically automatic transmission cars, whereas a class 3 licence allows the holder to drive all motor vehicles. Class 3A drivers are not allowed to drive manual transmission cars.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/drivinglicense/legalreq.htm | title = Driving in Singapore \u2013 Singapore Police Force | accessdate = 11 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150226214724/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/drivinglicense/legalreq.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nDrivers must be 18 years old to qualify for a [[Driver's license|licence]] including applying for theory lessons. Once a driver passes the Basic Theory Test (BTT), a Provisional Driving Licence (PDL) which lasts for six months before December 2017, 2 years validity after 1 December 2017, must be applied before taking the practical driving lesson. It is an offence to learn to drive without a valid PDL licence. However, a student can choose to apply and pass the Final Theory Test (FTT) before applying for a PDL and starting driving lessons. The last stage of obtaining a driving licence is the practical driving test, for which a student must have a FTT pass result slip and a valid PDL. Failure to do so will cause the test to be rejected by the Traffic Police Tester.\n\nThe driving theory tests consist of 50 questions to be answered within 50 minutes; to pass, you must answer 45 out of the 50 questions correctly. Results are shown immediately after the test on the same touchscreen monitor.\n\n===Foreign drivers in Singapore===\nThe Singapore Traffic Police require foreigners residing in Singapore to have a valid foreign driver's licence and to be at least 18 years old.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/information_drivinglicence_legal.htm |title=Legal Requirement |access-date=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107014251/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/driving_in_singapore/information_drivinglicence_legal.htm |archive-date=7 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConversion to a Singaporean licence is often possible for certain classes of vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.police.gov.sg/resources/traffic-matters/getting-a-licence/conversion-of-driving-license |title=Conversion of Driving Licence |accessdate=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724112016/https://www.police.gov.sg/resources/traffic-matters/getting-a-licence/conversion-of-driving-license |archive-date=24 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nForeigners who have obtained a Singapore licence are supplied with a limited-duration licence which needs to be renewed between one month before expiry to three years after expiry. After this period, the conversion procedure or licensing theory and practical tests must be taken all over again.\n\nAll foreigners visiting or residing in Singapore will need to produce an IDP (International Driving Permit) produced by their home country with an English Driving Licence. The IDP (International Driving Permit) lasts for a year. However, Countries under ASEAN are exempt from carrying an IDP. Foreigners must present both a valid Singapore Driving License and Employment Pass/FIN card with at least 6 months of validity.\n\n===Licence renewal===\nNo renewal of a driving licence is required for Singapore citizens and permanent residents since the introduction of the photocard licence. The driving licence is for the normal lifespan of the person and can be surrendered upon request to the [[Traffic Police]]. If the person passes away, the licence will have to be surrendered to the Traffic Police for cancellation, similar to National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). It is an offence for any persons to continue or to possess or use any other persons's identity cards listed above without authorization.\n\nA person who commits 12 demerit points and is above 80 years old is subject to early termination of the driving licence indefinitely. Additionally, no new drivers over 79 years old are accepted. Random medical check-up screenings will be required for those over 62 years old for all drivers that still want to drive.\n\nFor Class 4, 5, bus and taxi driving licences, annual medical check-ups are done from 70 years old all the way to 80. The upper age limit is 81.\n\n===Riding motorcycles registered on a different holder===\nIn Singapore, it is illegal to ride a motorcycle if the rider's name is not entered in the insurance contract. For each motorcycle, only one co-rider can be entered, but the procedure to change the co-rider is comparatively quick and easy. The only exception is commercial insurance, where any rider can use the vehicle. Only a business registered company can register for a commercial insurance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aloride.com/download/Insurance/Certificates/FBF121D.pdf|title=Certificate of Insurance|last=|first=|date=|website=AloRide - Singapore Motorbike Rental|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924093832/https://aloride.com/download/Insurance/Certificates/FBF121D.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Driver Improvement Points System===\nThe Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is a system whereby demerit points will be added to the driver's record. The system is meant to deter drivers from infringing the rules-of-the-road and, if they do, suspend their driving licence for a period of time. This system requires offenders to retest and pass the driving test again from the beginning.\n\nIf a driver accumulates 24 [[demerit point]]s within a period of two years, he/she will be suspended from driving for three months. If he/she had been suspended before, he/she will only be allowed to accumulate less than 12 demerit points in a period of 12 months. It is a driving licence scheme where those foreigners who have their licence suspended will have their licences affected, as this is from other countries. A driving licence is a statutory requirement and is commonly used worldwide.\n\nCurrently, drivers are given demerit points if they commit certain traffic offences such as [[speeding]] and passengers not fastening their [[seat belt]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/dips/about.htm | title=About DIPS |publisher=Singapore Police Force | accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607130508/http://driving-in-singapore.spf.gov.sg/services/Driving_in_Singapore/Information/dips/about.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Roads in Singapore==\n===Electronic Road Pricing===\n[[File:027 ERP gantry.jpg|thumb|right|ERP gantry]]\n{{Main|Electronic Road Pricing (Singapore)}}\nThe [[Land Transport Authority]] (LTA) in Singapore implemented an Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) scheme to deter traffic congestion during peak hours at various roads. The ERP scheme requires electronic gantries to be placed over the road at designated locations and that cars be equipped with an In-Vehicle Unit (IU), a rectangular device pasted on the inside bottom right of the front windscreen from the driver's view, which will deduct the toll price from a [[CashCard]]. The CashCard must be inserted into the device, and failure to do so is in violation of the law. There is no charge for entering the area during certain non-peak times.\n\n===Low Emission Zone===\nThe LTA also implemented the Low Emission Zone to deter air pollution at various roads, as part of the change of law.\n*2014: All buses, vans, lorries and minibusses must meet minimum Euro II emissions onwards. All taxis must meet minimum Euro III emissions onwards\n*Late 2017: All buses, vans, lorries and minibusses must meet minimum Euro III emissions onwards. All taxis must meet minimum Euro IV emissions onwards\n\n===Parking===\nThe cost of parking in many upgraded car parks can be deducted from the CashCard inserted in the IU of the vehicle, thus eliminating the need for the car park to have an attendant. Although the cost of parking (which is published) is variable, parking costs tend to be much less expensive compared to London and New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/parking/parking_rates/downtown_rates.html|title=ONE.MOTORING \u2013 Downtown Rates<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=www.onemotoring.com.sg|access-date=27 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510084541/http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/parking/parking_rates/downtown_rates.html|archive-date=10 May 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Centrepoint shopping centre charges a mere S$1 (approximately US$0.70) for the first hour, whereas garages in New York on [[Fifth Avenue]] and 57th Street charge between US$12 and US$26 for one hour.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nycgarages.com/ | title=Compare Parking Rates Daily/Monthly Garages Lots | access-date=27 April 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419093650/http://www.nycgarages.com/ | archive-date=19 April 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSome car parks in Singapore are equipped with sensors that can detect whether the position is filled or not. This information is processed and displayed in signs around the car park, directing drivers to areas where there are free spaces.\n\n\u2018Season Parking\u2019 is an initiative created by the Housing & Development Board (HDB) for motorists to engage in long-term parking of their vehicles in HDB car parks. There are several types of season parking in Singapore.<ref>https://www.motorist.sg/article/457/4-important-know-hows-about-hdb-season-parking</ref>\n\n===Road signs===\n{{Main|Road signs in Singapore}}\nDuring British colonial rule, Singapore's road rules and legislature which govern the design and layout of the road signs were directly imported from Britain. As such, most road signs in Singapore are similar to those in the UK. For example, warning signs are depicted as red triangles and mandatory regulative signs are depicted as blue circles.\n\nHowever, several aspects of road signage and traffic-calming measures adopted locally developed standards after independence. Major deviations are as follows:\n\n1. A locally developed [[typeface]] is favoured for the road signs over the [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]] typeface which was adopted in Britain.\n\n2. In 1998, a system of black-on-yellow \"curve alignment markers\" was widely adopted and gradually replaced the British system of using white-on-black sharp deviation signs to delineate sharp turns. A few of the British-system signs were kept such as in Mandai Road and Suntec City.\n\n3. In the late 1990s, all the circular regulatory signs and triangular warning signs were mounted to a one-size-fits-all square white backing board to improve visibility against a complex background like trees.\n\n4. In the early 2000s, signs at road works were made usually black-on-orange and diamond- or rectangular-shaped, similar to the Taiwanese system.\n\nMost roads, bridges, [[roundabout]]s, and tunnels are marked with signposts bearing the name of the road. The expressways in Singapore are not numbered (unlike in most other countries), but are named. Road signs abbreviate the full name of the expressway with three representative letters, such as '''PIE''' for the '''P'''an '''I'''sland '''E'''xpressway or '''ECP''' for the '''E'''ast '''C'''oast '''P'''arkway, respectively.\n\nAlmost all road signs in Singapore are in English although many road names have a Malay origin. Typically, \"Jalan\" is used for \"Road\" and \"Lorong\" is used for \"Lane\". Multilingual road signs exist, especially for historically ethnic enclaves like Chinatown or Little India, or for landmarks. For example, some directional signs pointing to Chinese or Hindu temples are bilingual or trilingual (English, Chinese, or Tamil). Bilingual signage dates to the early days of Singapore.\n\n5. Curiously enough, even on the larger signs, road names are rarely spelt out in full. For example, \"road\" is almost always \"Rd\" (\"Avenue\" as \"Ave\", \"Bukit\" as \"Bt\", \"Boulevard\" as \"Blvd\", \"Close\" as \"Cl\", \"Central\" as \"Ctrl\", \"Crescent\" as \"Cres\", \"Drive\" as \"Dr\", \"Jalan\" as \"Jln\", \"Kampong\" as \"Kg\", \"Lane\" as \"Ln\", \"Lorong\" as \"Lor\", \"Upper\" as \"Upp\", \"Place\" as \"Pl\", \"Saint\" and \"Street\" as \"St\", \"Tanjong\" as \"Tg\"). Exceptions include roads that end with less common words, such as \"walk\", \"hill\", and \"park\".\n\n===Left turn or right turn at a red traffic light===\n'''Left Turn'''\n\nIn Singapore, it is illegal to turn left (into the nearest lane, due to the left-hand driving) during a red light. This rule, however, does not apply if a \"Left Turn on Red\" sign is present at the junction, allowing left-turning motorists to turn left, provided they stop before the stop line and give way to pedestrians and incoming traffic.\n\n'''Right Turn'''\n\nIt is illegal to turn right during a red light in Singapore.\n\nRight turns are permissible only when one's lane has the green light signal and the opposing traffic lane, travelling in the opposite direction, is clear and favourable to execute a right turn. However, green turning signals (the outline of a right-pointing arrow) are installed onto some traffic lights.\n\nThese rules in Singapore are similar to many countries that employ [[left-hand traffic]], and unlike countries which permit turns on red.\n\n===Special Roads===\nDue to the limited land space in Singapore, selected roads, especially those with more lanes have been specially designated as runways for aircraft in the event of an emergency or when needs arise.\n\n==Traffic safety==\n===Driving safety===\nDriving after consuming alcohol, using a phone while driving, dangerous driving, and car racing are all illegal. All offenders will face disqualification and be prosecuted in court.\n\n===Car safety crash tests===\nThe Singapore government accepts the crash safety standards of the EU and Japan. Cars made in the EU and Japan do not need to pass additional safety standards to be sold in Singapore. Cars may be privately imported into Singapore if they have an EU Certificate of Conformity or the Japanese Completion Inspection Certificate, both of which incorporate emissions and safety standards.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/singapore/how-to/page/singapore-transport-vehicle-ownership-importing-a-vehicle|title=Importing a Foreign Vehicle to Singapore|website=Angloinfo Singapore|publisher=[[Angloinfo]]|access-date=2016-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808085648/https://www.angloinfo.com/singapore/how-to/page/singapore-transport-vehicle-ownership-importing-a-vehicle|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Not all cars sold in Singapore have been tested by the [[EuroNCAP]], a car-safety testing organisation jointly operated by several European government agencies,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.euroncap.com/members.aspx |title=Euro NCAP \u2013 For safer cars {{!}}Members<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525002400/http://www.euroncap.com/members.aspx |archive-date=25 May 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that crash tests cars that can be legally sold in several European countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.euroncap.com/testresults.aspx |title=Euro NCAP \u2013 For safer cars {{!}}Test results<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=14 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512202929/http://www.euroncap.com/testresults.aspx |archive-date=12 May 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Buying a car==\nMany regulations concerning buying and driving a car are administered by the [[Land Transport Authority]], the successor to the Registry of Vehicles.\n\n===Certificate of Entitlement===\n{{Main|Certificate of Entitlement}}\nNew car buyers are required to buy a [[Certificate of Entitlement]] (COE), which is valid for ten years.

Standard licence plates in Singapore are usually black with silver or white lettering or the newer white front/yellow rear plate combination and Off-peak licence plates are white on red.\n\n==Car market==\n===Domestic car market===\nCar brands are typically sold by only one dealer although there are rare exceptions where two dealers sell the same brand. Several dealers have more than one location. Some dealers sell more than one brand, unlike the situation in some western European countries in the past where some manufacturers prohibited dealers from selling competing brands. Negotiation during car purchases is customary but limited due to the lack of competing dealers.\n\nThe limited size of the Singapore market results in some brands not offering the full model line in Singapore. Unlike in Australia, where the US [[Honda Accord]] and the Japanese Honda Accord (re-badged as the [[Acura TSX]] in the United States) are sold, only the Japanese Honda Accord is sold in Singapore. Some brands, such as [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] and [[Volvo]] (except the [[Volvo S60R]]) are only offered with [[automatic transmission]] even though [[manual transmission]] cars are sold in the car's home market.\n\nAlthough car prices are high, servicing costs are reasonable compared to in the United States and Western Europe in terms of labour charges.\n\n[[Sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs) and [[pick-up truck]]s are not as common in Singapore as in the United States and Canada. So, pick-up trucks in Singapore are relatively expensive compared to other [[South East Asia|Southeast Asia]]n countries, and some dealerships do not import pick-up trucks like the [[Nissan Frontier|Nissan Navara]] and [[Ford Ranger (international)|Thai-built Ford Ranger]] at all.\n[[File:2016 Toyota Corolla Altis (ZRE172R) 1.6 sedan (2017-11-28).jpg|thumb|right|[[Toyota Corolla (E170)|Toyota Corolla Altis]]]]\nJapanese car manufacturers have the largest market share. Some Japanese cars are imported from countries other than Japan. For example, the [[Toyota Vios]] is imported from [[Thailand]], whereas the [[Japanese Domestic Market|JDM]] version is called [[Toyota Belta]]. Initially, the [[Toyota Corolla (E120)|ninth generation Toyota Corolla]] sold in Singapore was a [[Japanese Domestic Market|Japanese model]], while the facelift version is a wider and longer [[Toyota Corolla (E140)|Corolla Altis]] from Thailand.\n[[File:Subaru R2, facelift, front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Subaru R2]]]]\n[[Kei car]]s (like the [[Mitsubishi i]], [[Subaru R2]], and [[Suzuki Carry]]) are common in Singapore, but not as popular as in [[Japanese domestic market]] as most Japanese car manufacturers seldom release Kei cars in Singapore. Besides this, there are some grey imports of Kei cars like [[Daihatsu Copen]].\n\nEuropean car manufacturers are well represented. On the more expensive segment of the market, European cars sold in Singapore include [[Aston Martin]], [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Bmw]], and others. [[Skoda Auto|Skoda]], [[Fiat]], [[Renault]], [[Peugeot]] and [[Citroen]] are among the less expensive European cars sold in Singapore.\n\nAmerican cars have a low market share. [[Chrysler]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], and [[Jeep]] vehicles are sold in Singapore, such as the [[Chrysler 300]]C, [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]], [[Dodge Caliber]], and [[Jeep Wrangler]]. [[Chevrolet]] markets only Korean-made Daewoo cars, but not its American-made models. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] markets some cars from its European line, not its American product line. Even [[Subaru]], a Japanese carmaker, did not do well with cars made by a US-based subsidiary, [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.|Subaru of Indiana Automotive]], which exported the US-made [[Subaru Tribeca|Tribeca]] to Singapore.\n\nNon-Japanese Asian car brands sold in Singapore include [[Perodua]], [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]], [[Ssangyong]], [[Hafei Motor]], [[Chery]], [[Geely]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], [[Chang'an Motors|Chana]], and [[Holden Special Vehicles]].\n\nUsed cars that are more than three years old cannot be imported into Singapore.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Aftermarket===\nBecause Singapore does not have a domestic automobile industry and thus has a very small ''domestic market'' for remanufactured and reconditioned auto parts, it has become an especially important [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] for businesses exporting automotive parts and accessories. This is magnified by high automobile turnover, a preference for new parts, and high demand for \"accessories, car-care products, prestige items, and new spare parts\". In fact, Singapore has become a major automotive ''components'' manufacturing base, as several leading multinational corporations (MNCs) have established international procurement offices as well as their Southeast Asia distribution centres.<ref name=sing>{{cite web|last=Ng |first=Haw Cheng |title=Singapore: Automobiles and Vehicle Parts & Accessories |url=http://www.aftermarketsuppliers.org/Doc-Vault/OAC/Singapore-Automotive-Report.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Commercial Service]] |date=November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320095812/http://www.aftermarketsuppliers.org/Doc-Vault/OAC/Singapore-Automotive-Report.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Singapore as an automobile exporter===\nThe peculiarities of Singapore's car market has made Singapore the second largest exporter of used cars in the world (approximately 100,000 cars exported per year) after Japan.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Singapore exports its cars to many countries, including African countries.

Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to resale value or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's [[depreciation]] costs or financing costs.<ref>[http://www.kiplinger.com/basics/archives/2003/02/buying4.html \"Should You Keep Your Old Car?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504215430/http://www.kiplinger.com/basics/archives/2003/02/buying4.html |date=4 May 2007 }}, ''Kiplinger.com''</ref>\n\n==Left-hand drive Vs Right-hand drive==\nIn Singapore, only right-hand-drive cars are permitted on the roads.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/lta_information_guidelines/buy_a_new_vehicle/self_importation_.MainPar.22837.File.tmp/Car.pdf&ei=Zbj1U9SsN4ahugSWj4DAAw&usg=AFQjCNHTc_pJsESOog6-rHv936wzuqfI-Q |title=PROCEDURES ON IMPORTATION AND REGISTRATION OF A CAR IN SINGAPORE |publisher=LTA |format=PDF |access-date=10 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407131700/http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/lta_information_guidelines/buy_a_new_vehicle/self_importation_.mainpar.22837.file.tmp/car.pdf%26ei%3Dzbj1u9ssn4ahugswj4daaw%26usg%3Dafqjcnhtc_pjsesoog6-rhv936wzuqfi-q |archive-date=7 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are exceptions for special-purpose vehicles, diplomatic vehicles, and foreign-registered vehicles, with the label placed at the back windscreen of the vehicles indicating \"Left Hand Drive\" to alert other motorists that the driver's seat is on the left side instead of on the right side.\n\n==Petrol market==\n===Retail petrol market===\nIn 2017, there were about 170 petrol stations across the city-state, a decrease from 222 stations in 2013.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/shell-to-end-partnership-with-7-eleven-chain|title=Shell to end partnership with 7-Eleven chain|last=hermes|date=2017-10-02|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Many were closed as they were either deemed a security risk or the license had lapsed.<ref name=\":0\" /> These stations operate under brands of five multinational companies, with no independent retailers.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.cccs.gov.sg/-/media/custom/ccs/files/media-and-publications/publications/market-studies/petrol-final-report-2017/report-on-ccs-market-inquiry-on-retail-petrol.pdf|title=2017 Market Inquiry on Retail Petrol Prices in Singapore|last=|first=|date=19 December 2017|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> The petrol station network is largely operated by four incumbent retailers: [[Royal Dutch Shell]], retailing petrol under the brand \"Shell\", [[ExxonMobil]], retailing petrol under the brand \"[[Esso]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stations.esso.com.sg/en-sg/|title=Petrol Stations - Find a Petrol Station in Singapore - Esso|website=www.stations.esso.com.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], retailing petrol under the brand \"[[Caltex]]\", and [[Singapore Petroleum Company]], retailing petrol under the brand \"SPC\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The incumbent retailers are vertically integrated, with their supplies of refined petrol coming from their refineries situated at Jurong Island.<ref name=\":1\" /> Potential new entrants to the market face high barriers to entry in form of additional premiums paid to acquire retail petrol sites that are planned for by [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA) and tendered out by [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.cccs.gov.sg/-/media/custom/ccs/files/media-and-publications/publications/market-studies/inquiry-into-retail-petrol-market-in-singapore-may-23.pdf|title=An Inquiry Into the Retail Petrol Market Study in Singapore|last=|first=|date=19 May 2011|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|access-date=2 November 2019}}</ref> It was also determined that for a viable retail petrol operation in Singapore, a new entrant would need to operate minimally 30 sites, which is hard to achieve at the average rate of 2.4 new tenders per anuum.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2017, [[Sinopec]] won the bids for two retail sites, with the first site coming into operation in November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/china-oil-giant-enters-singapore-petrol-station-business|title=China oil giant enters Singapore petrol station business|last=hermes|date=2017-10-01|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/china-sinopec-singapore-first-overseas-fuel-station-11046398|title=China's Sinopec opens first overseas petrol station in Yishun|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>\n\nFour grades of petrol are commonly sold in Singapore.

This permits ownership of the vehicle for a period of 10 years after which the vehicle must be scrapped or another COE paid for allowing an additional 5 or 10 years of usage.

The repressive military regime prohibited all manifestations of rock music, along with many other forms of culture (see [[Military government of Chile (1973\u20131990)#Cultural life|Military government of Chile (1973-1990): cultural life]]). This brought about a decline of the music industry in Chile and a deterioration of the Chilean rock scene. Some Latin American fusion bands broke up, like Los Blop's, while others fled abroad, like [[Los Jaivas]], who emigrated to Argentina. Others, like [[Congreso]], were forced to radically change their music to a progressive rock style. By late 70's, an underground scene gradually began to emerge with [[punk rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and later [[new wave music]] becoming increasingly popular.\n\nHowever, one of the most well-known and influential bands since the 80's, and from all history of chilean rock, was ''[[Los Prisioneros]]'', who were especially known for their outspoken songwriter and lead vocalist, [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (musician)|Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez]]. The trio was also conformed by [[Claudio Narea]] on guitar and second voices, and [[Miguel Tapia]] on drums. Musically ranged from [[rockabilly]], to [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[punk]] and later [[synth pop]]. Jorge Leiva of Musica Popular describes Los Prisioneros as \u201cby far the most representative Chilean rock group. Their stripped-down rock, free from virtuoso pretensions, and their lyrics, full of acute social observation, were the voice of youth disenchantment during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\u201d<ref>[http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=315 Los Prisioneros] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017034327/http://www.musicapopular.cl/3.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=315 |date=2012-10-17 }} Jorge Leiva, www.musicapopular.cl.

She was designed by [[Philip Rhodes]] and built by Luders Marine Construction Company at Stamford, Connecticut for a syndicate of owners formed by Henry D. Mercer, with Cornelius S. Walsch and Arnold D. Frese. ''Weatherly'' was launched in 1958.  She was built of steel frames with mahogany planking.\n\n==Career==\n\nSkippered by Arthur Knapp, ''Weatherly'' competed with [[Columbia (1958 yacht)|''Columbia'']], [[Easterner (yacht)|''Easterner'']], [[Gleam (yacht)|''Gleam'']], and [[Vim (yacht)|''Vim'']] for the right to defend the America's cup but was outclassed in the 1958 selection trials. ''Columbia'' went on to successfully defend the Cup in 1958.\n\nModified by [[Bill Luders]] at Luders yard in 1962, ''Weatherly'' was redesigned with a shorter bow and reduced wetted surface. Weight saved in the redesign was put into the keel.\n\nThe defender selection trials pitted ''Weatherly'' against ''Columbia'', ''Easterner'' and [[Nefertiti (yacht)|''Nefertiti'']].

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 14.8\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route. Dietzenbach moreover has at its disposal its own town bus network with a central bus station at the ''Dietzenbach Mitte'' S-Bahn station. Bus lines which cross Dietzenbach are the town lines OF-56 and 57, the county lines OF95, 96, 97 and 99 as well as night line n71. ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 459, the [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and  [[Bundesautobahn 661|A&nbsp;661]] can be reached in a few minutes through the Offenbach [[interchange (road)|interchange]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festival ===\nEach year in Dietzenbach, the following festivals offer a chance to pursue social contacts:\n* ''Apfelbl\u00fctenfest'' is being held in April.\n* ''Fest ohne Grenzen'' (\u201cFestival Without Borders\u201d), held at the Hessentagspark\n* ''Fest der Biere'' (\u201cFestival of Beers\u201d), held at the Harmonieplatz, lasts five days\n* ''Weinfest'' in the New Town Centre, runs ten days\n* ''Nacht der Lichter''(\u201cNight of the Lights\u201d)with \"Museumsnacht\" and \"Heimatfest\" held in the Old Town Centre\n* ''Trinkbornfest'' in the Old Town on the first weekend in September\n* ''Dietzenbacher Kelterfest'' about the \"\u00c4bbelwoi\" and the making of it\n* ''Kerb'' or ''[[Kirchweih]]'', always held on the last weekend in October. It stretches along Landwehrstra\u00dfe from Harmonieplatz to the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Schule (school). The revived tradition of the ''Kerbborsche'' \u2013 a group of young men who perform part of the ceremony<!--Perhaps someone can find out what part.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 14.8\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\nSusan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\nManny Heffley is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[https://i.redd.it/dei2exvxu2231.png manny heffley]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe |date= April 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2015}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2015}}\n\nThis is a list of characters in [[Jeff Kinney (author)|Jeff Kinney]]'s ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' graphic novel series, as well as in the film adaptations of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|first]],<ref name=\"MDN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x2118273676/Nothing-Wimpy-about-local-authors-success |title=Nothing 'Wimpy' about local author's success |last=McCarron |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Milford Daily News]] |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}</ref> [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (film)|second]],<ref name=\"Moviefone\">[http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' Sequel to Bow Next March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325214154/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 |date=2012-03-25 }}.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\nSusan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\nManny Heffley is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids.

It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould.

He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband.

They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since.

This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "name_user": "70.93.75.25", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters"}
