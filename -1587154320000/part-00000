See WP:ENGVAR.--> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Salford]] in 1976. The group consisted of vocalist [[Ian Curtis]], guitarist/keyboardist [[Bernard Sumner]], bassist [[Peter Hook]] and drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]].\n\nSumner and Hook formed the band after attending a [[Sex Pistols]] concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early [[punk rock|punk]], they soon developed a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the [[post-punk]] movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'' drew the attention of the Manchester television personality [[Tony Wilson]], who signed them to his independent label [[Factory Records]]. Their debut album ''[[Unknown Pleasures]]'', recorded with producer [[Martin Hannett]], was released in 1979.\n\nCurtis suffered from personal problems including a failing marriage, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[epilepsy]]. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced [[generalised tonic-clonic seizure|seizure]]s on stage. He killed himself on the eve of the band's first US/Canada tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]'', was released two months later; it and the single \"[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]\" became their highest charting releases.\n\nThe remaining members regrouped under the name [[New Order (band)|New Order]]. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dance music]] influences.<ref name=\"Ankeny\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/new-order-mn0000334193/biography |title=New Order: Biography |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation ===\nOn 20 July 1976, childhood friends [[Bernard Sumner]] and [[Peter Hook]] separately attended a [[Sex Pistols]] show at the [[Free Trade Hall|Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall]].

Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the band, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}} To avoid confusion with the London punk band [[Warsaw Pakt]], the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing the name from the [[German military brothels in World War II|sexual slavery]] wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel ''[[House of Dolls]]''.{{sfn|Ogg|2006|p=572}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=111}} In December, the group recorded their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'', at Pennine Sound Studio and played their final gig as Warsaw on New Year's Eve at the Swinging Apple in Liverpool.{{sfn|Johnson|1984|p=17}} Billed as Warsaw to ensure an audience, the band played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester.{{sfn|Johnson|1984|p=19}}\n\n=== Early releases ===\nJoy Division were approached by [[RCA Records]] to record a cover of [[Nolan Porter|Nolan \"N.F.\" Porter]]'s \"Keep on Keepin' On\" at a Manchester recording studio.

Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his [[Granada Television]] show ''[[So It Goes (TV series)|So It Goes]]''; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=61}} Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager.<ref name=\"Barrett\"/> Gretton, whose \"dogged determination\" was later credited for much of the band's public success, contributed the business skills to provide Joy Division with a better foundation for creativity.{{sfn|Johnson|1984|p=24}}{{sfn|West|1984|p=14}} Joy Division spent the first week of May 1978 recording at Manchester's Arrow Studios. The band were unhappy with the Grapevine Records head John Anderson's insistence on adding synthesiser into the mix to soften the sound, and asked to be dropped from the contract with RCA.{{sfn|Ott|2004|p=42}}{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=135}}\n\nJoy Division made their recorded debut in June 1978 when the band self-released ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'', and two weeks later their track \"At a Later Date\" was featured on the compilation album ''[[Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus]]'' (which had been recorded live in October 1977).{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|pp=141, 143}}{{sfn|Curtis|1995|pp=51\u201352, 140}} In the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' review, Chris Brazier said that it \"has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors\u2014there are a lot of good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Brazier |first=Chris |date=24 June 1978 |title=''An Ideal for Living'' review |magazine=[[Melody Maker]]}}</ref> The packaging of ''An Ideal for Living''\u2014which featured a drawing of a [[Hitler Youth]] member on the cover\u2014coupled with the nature of the band's name fuelled speculation about their political affiliations.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=54}} While Hook and Sumner later said they were intrigued by [[fascism]] at the time, Morris believed that the group's dalliance with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during [[World War II]] alive. He argued that accusations of [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] sympathies merely provoked the band \"to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=111}}\n\nIn September 1978, Joy Division made their television debut performing \"[[Shadowplay (song)|Shadowplay]]\" on ''So It Goes'', with an introduction by Wilson.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=202}} In October,<ref name=\"Cook\"/> Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer [[Martin Hannett]] to the compilation double-7\" EP ''[[A Factory Sample]]'', the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, [[Factory Records]].

Although the schedule was demanding, Curtis experienced only two grand mal seizures, both in the final two months of the tour.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=107}} That March, the band recorded their second album, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]],'' with Hannett at London's [[Britannia Row Studios]].<ref name=\"Raftery\">{{cite magazine |last=Raftery |first=Brian |date=May 2005 |title=He's Lost Control |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]}}</ref> That month they released the \"[[Atmosphere (Joy Division song)|Licht und Blindheit]]\" single, with \"Atmosphere\" as the A-side and \"Dead Souls\" as the B-side, on the French independent label [[Sordide Sentimental]].{{sfn|Gimarc|2005|p=307}}\n\nA lack of sleep and long hours destabilised Curtis's epilepsy, and his seizures became almost uncontrollable.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=113}} He often had seizures during performances, which some audience members believed were part of the performance. The seizures left him feeling ashamed and depressed, and the band became increasingly worried about Curtis's condition.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=114}} On 7 April 1980, Curtis attempted suicide by overdosing on his anti-seizure medication, [[Phenobarbital|phenobarbitone]].<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> The following evening, Joy Division were scheduled to play a gig at the [[Derby Hall (Bury)|Derby Hall]] in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]].{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=117}} Curtis was too ill to perform, so at Gretton's insistence the band played a combined set with Alan Hempsall of [[Crispy Ambulance]] and Simon Topping of [[A Certain Ratio]] singing on the first few songs. When Topping came back towards the end of the set, some audience members threw bottles at the stage. Curtis's ill health led to the cancellation of several other gigs that April.

He wrote; \"I was like, head in hands, 'Oh fucking hell, it's happening again ... Martin had fucking melted the guitar with his [[Stephen St. Croix|Marshall Time Waster]].

He was also anxious about how American audiences would react to his epilepsy.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe evening before the band were due to depart for America, Curtis returned to his Macclesfield home to talk to Deborah. He asked her to drop an impending divorce suit, and asked her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|pp=131\u2013132}} Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the [[Werner Herzog]] film ''[[Stroszek]]'', Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=132}}\n\nThe suicide shocked the band and their management. In 2005, Wilson said: \"I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen&nbsp;... We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were.\"<ref name=\"Raftery\" /> [[Music critic]] [[Simon Reynolds]] said Curtis's suicide \"made for instant myth\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=118}} Jon Savage's obituary said that \"now no one will remember what his work with Joy Division was like when he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Savage |first=Jon |date=14 June 1980 |title=From Safety to Where? |magazine=Melody Maker}}</ref> In June 1980, Joy Division's single \"[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]\" was released, which hit number thirteen on the [[UK Singles Chart]].{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=138}} In July 1980, ''Closer'' was released, and peaked at number six on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\" /> ''NME'' reviewer [[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote, \"''Closer'' is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-[[Elvis Presley|Presley]] popular musician could have.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Murrary |first=Charles Shaar |date=19 July 1980 |title=Closer to the Edge |magazine=NME}}</ref>\n\nMorris said that even without Curtis's death, it is unlikely that Joy Division would have endured.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2010-12/17/gq-music-stephen-morris-joy-division-interview|title=An Ideal for Reliving|first=Lee|last=Gale|magazine=[[GQ]]|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref> The members had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the band name.<ref name=\"Morley, Thrills\" /> The band re-formed as [[New Order (band)|New Order]], with Sumner on vocals; they later recruited Morris's girlfriend [[Gillian Gilbert]] as keyboardist and second guitarist.

''[[Still (Joy Division album)|Still]]'', featuring live tracks and rare recordings, was issued in 1981.

A comprehensive box set, ''[[Heart and Soul (Joy Division album)|Heart and Soul]]'', appeared in 1997.\n\n== Musical style ==\n===Sound===\nJoy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=110}} According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|loc=\"Foreword\"}} In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" <ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> By ''Closer'', Curtis had adapted a low [[baritone]] voice, drawing comparisons to [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] (one of Curtis's favourite bands).{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=112}}\n\nSumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order.<ref name=\"Lester\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/31/popandrock.joydivision |title=It Felt Like Someone Had Ripped Out My Heart |last=Lester |first=Paul |date=31 August 2007 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=75}} During the recording sessions for ''Closer'', Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=116}}\n\nProducer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=112}} The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\".<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit.

The group consisted of vocalist [[Ian Curtis]], guitarist/keyboardist [[Bernard Sumner]], bassist [[Peter Hook]] and drummer [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]].\n\nSumner and Hook formed the band after attending a [[Sex Pistols]] concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early [[punk rock|punk]], they soon developed a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the [[post-punk]] movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP ''[[An Ideal for Living]]'' drew the attention of the Manchester television personality [[Tony Wilson]], who signed them to his independent label [[Factory Records]]. Their debut album ''[[Unknown Pleasures]]'', recorded with producer [[Martin Hannett]], was released in 1979.\n\nCurtis suffered from personal problems including a failing marriage, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[epilepsy]]. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced [[generalised tonic-clonic seizure|seizure]]s on stage. He killed himself on the eve of the band's first US/Canada tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, ''[[Closer (Joy Division album)|Closer]]'', was released two months later; it and the single \"[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]\" became their highest charting releases.\n\nThe remaining members regrouped under the name [[New Order (band)|New Order]].

He was also anxious about how American audiences would react to his epilepsy.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe evening before the band were due to depart for America, Curtis returned to his Macclesfield home to talk to Deborah.

A comprehensive box set, ''[[Heart and Soul (Joy Division album)|Heart and Soul]]'', appeared in 1997.\n\n== Musical style ==\n===Sound===\nJoy Division's style quickly evolved from their punk roots. Their sound during their early inception as Warsaw was described as generic and \"undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] observed how the band's originality only \"really became apparent as the songs got slower\", and their music took on a \"sparse\" quality. According to Reynolds, \"Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage and Steve Morris' drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\"{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=110}} According to music critic Jon Savage, \"Joy Division were not punk but they were directly inspired by its energy\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|loc=\"Foreword\"}} In 1994 Sumner said the band's characteristic sound \"came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" <ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> By ''Closer'', Curtis had adapted a low [[baritone]] voice, drawing comparisons to [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]] (one of Curtis's favourite bands).{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=112}}\n\nSumner largely acted as the band's director, a role he continued in New Order.<ref name=\"Lester\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/31/popandrock.joydivision |title=It Felt Like Someone Had Ripped Out My Heart |last=Lester |first=Paul |date=31 August 2007 |website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=75}} During the recording sessions for ''Closer'', Sumner began using self-built synthesisers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=116}}\n\nProducer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to use studio technology to create sonic space.{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=112}} The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue\".<ref name=\"Mojo 1994\"/> Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=113}} Music journalist [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] noted that Hannett's role was \"crucial\".

But everyone's got their own opinion.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Woodard |first=Josef |date=November 1987 |title=Out from the Shadows: New Order |magazine=[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]}}</ref> Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of ''Closer'' did many who were close to the singer realise \"[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics\".{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=139}} The surviving members regret not seeing the warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. Morris said that \"it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics...you'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself.

A supplement, '''''With One Voice''''' ('''''WOV'''''), contains additional hymns and service music. The ''LBW'' is sometimes called the \"green book\", as opposed to ''With One Voice'', which is bound in blue; or ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]'', which is bound in red; or ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'', which is also bound in red, with a simple gold cross.\n\n== History ==\nWhen Lutheran churches were first established in North America, the immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and other non-English-speaking countries retained services in their native languages. However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language [[liturgy]] and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \"one church [with] one book\", it was not until the 1888 \"Common Service\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \"Common Liturgy\" included in the 1958 [[Service Book and Hymnal]] was a major revision of the \"Common Service\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. ''Culto Cristiano'', a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans.\n\nThe process leading to the publication of the ''LBW'' was started in 1965 when the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book. Together with the LCMS, the [[Lutheran Church in America]], the [[American Lutheran Church]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada]] formed the '''Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship''' to undertake this project. The commission conducted its work through four sub-committees: Liturgical Text Committee, Liturgical Music Committee, Hymn Text Committee, Hymn Music Committee. The work of the committees was validated via provisional liturgical and hymn materials, questionnaires, conferences, and dialogs. The Rev. Dr. Eugene Brand was named project director for the development work and The Rev. Leonard Flachman was named publishers' representative and managing editor. The ''LBW'' was published in [[1978 in literature|1978]]. The LCMS pulled out of the ILCW just prior to the publication of the ''LBW'', but having been a participant in the development of the materials its name appears on the title page. The LCMS published its own hymnal, ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (LW), in 1982.  Although the ''LW'' liturgies are very similar to those in the ''LBW'', there are differences which reflect differing theologies. For example, ''LW'' lacks the option for a Eucharistic Prayer.\n\nThe ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' has remained in use for thirty years. There are a couple reasons for that longevity. The first is the careful, forward-looking, inclusive work of the ILCW and the four subcommittees. The second is the careful work done by the staff of [[Augsburg Fortress|Augsburg Publishing House]] in selecting and testing the materials with which the book was manufactured. The books did not wear out.\n\nThe first printing of the ''LBW'' was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States.\n\nWhile it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the ''LBW'' was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of English-language hymnals by denomination]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Augsburg Publishing House and Lutheran Church in America Publication Board|year=1978|isbn=0-8006-3330-X|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=With One Voice|last=|first=|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|year=1995|isbn=0-8066-0051-9|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/withonevoiceluth00evan}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|year=1997|isbn=0-8006-2726-1|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Encountering God: The Legacy of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Kirk House Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-886513-15-5|editor-last=Van Loon|editor-first=Ralph R.|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=In the Context of Unity: A History of the Development of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=Quere|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Lutheran University Press|year=2003|isbn=1-932688-00-5|location=|pages=}}\n\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1978 books]]\n[[Category:Christian prayer books]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:1978 in music]]\n[[Category:1978 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Worship book and hymnal used by several Lutheran denominations in North America}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''Lutheran Book of Worship'''\n| cover           = Lutheran Book of Worship.JPG\n| caption         = 1978 edition of the ''Lutheran Book of Worship''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = 1978\n| number_of_hymns = 569\n| psalms          = 150\n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]''\n| next_hymnal     = ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''\n}}\n\nThe '''''Lutheran Book of Worship''''' ('''''LBW''''') is a [[worship]] book and [[hymn]]al used by several [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] in [[North America]].

The books did not wear out.\n\nThe first printing of the ''LBW'' was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States.\n\nWhile it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the ''LBW'' was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of English-language hymnals by denomination]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Augsburg Publishing House and Lutheran Church in America Publication Board|year=1978|isbn=0-8006-3330-X|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=With One Voice|last=|first=|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|year=1995|isbn=0-8066-0051-9|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/withonevoiceluth00evan}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|year=1997|isbn=0-8006-2726-1|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Encountering God: The Legacy of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Kirk House Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-886513-15-5|editor-last=Van Loon|editor-first=Ralph R.|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=In the Context of Unity: A History of the Development of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=Quere|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Lutheran University Press|year=2003|isbn=1-932688-00-5|location=|pages=}}\n\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1978 books]]\n[[Category:Christian prayer books]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:1978 in music]]\n[[Category:1978 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n", "name_user": "Shruti14", "label": "safe", "comment": "wov infobox", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran_Book_of_Worship"}

The album contains cover versions of rock hits of the second half of the 20th century played on medieval instruments. The album was released on August 15, 2016 through the American label Cool Hat Records. It was created under the influence of [[YouTube]] users\u2019 feedback who admitted that the band's cover version video of \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\" by [[Metallica]] was a success.\n\nThe band Stary Olsa plays [[Eastern Europe]]an medieval songs, mostly of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] time. This is the only album of the band where they perform songs of the 20th century.\n\n==Background==\nThe leader of [[Stary Olsa]] band Zmicier Sasno\u016dski said in one of his interviews that modern music and music of the [[Middle Ages]] are surprisingly good combined. Reefs of guitar [[rock music]] can be easily and successfully played on ancient medieval instruments. Sasno\u016dski also said that they play modern songs on old instruments at the rehearsals from time to time but just for entertainment and treat this more like a joke and never play these songs at the concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tuzinfm.by/article/232/zmicer-sasnouski-daremna-gidzilisia-karparatyvau.html|title=\u0417\u044c\u043c\u0456\u0446\u0435\u0440 \u0421\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u045e\u0441\u043a\u0456: \"\u0414\u0430\u0440\u044d\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0456\u0434\u0437\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u045e\" (\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044d\u0430). \u0422\u0443\u0437\u0456\u043d \u0413\u0456\u0442\u043e\u045e. \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b|work=[[Tuzin.fm]]|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>\nIn October 2014 the band Stary Olsa took part in the show \"Legends.Live\" (\"\u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u044b.Live\") on [[Obshchenatsional'noe Televidenie|ONT]] channel, that was dedicated to Metallica band performance, where they sang the song \"[[One (Metallica song)|One]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tuzinfm.by/zhamerun/1357/stary-olsa-sykouna-syhrau-one-hurta-metallica.html|title=\"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0430\" \u0448\u044b\u043a\u043e\u045e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044b\u0433\u0440\u0430\u045e \"One\" \u0433\u0443\u0440\u0442\u0430 Metallica (\u0432\u0456\u0434\u044d\u0430). \u0422\u0443\u0437\u0456\u043d \u0413\u0456\u0442\u043e\u045e. \u0421\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b|work=[[Tuzin.fm]]|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref> The video of this performance aroused interest among [[YouTube]] viewers.

The album was released on August 15, 2016 through the American label Cool Hat Records.

It consists of five entities, namely: Supreme Federal Court (STF), Superior Court of Justice (STJ), federal regional courts and federal judges, military courts and judges, and courts and judges of states, the federal district and territories. The STF as well as the higher courts - as well as the Superior Labor Court (TST), the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Superior Military Court (STM) - are based in Brasilia, the Brazil's capital, and have jurisdiction throughout Brazil. Eleven ministers compose the Supreme Federal Court, whose main competence is to keep the constitution. 33 ministers form at least the STJ. \n\n==Overview==\nThe system is divided primarily into ordinary courts (''Justi\u00e7a comum'') and specialized courts (''Justi\u00e7a especializada'').\n\nThe specialized courts are federal  and are divided into three areas of practice: military courts, labor courts and electoral courts.\n\nThe ordinary courts are divided between federal and state judiciaries. The judiciary of the [[Brazilian Federal District]] has the same subject-matter jurisdiction as other ordinary state-level judiciaries over its territory, but is kept and organized by the federal government.\n\nMunicipalities hold no judicial powers.\n\nThe system also includes two special central courts that are separate from the other divisions: The [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] and the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]]. Both have headquarters in [[Bras\u00edlia]].\n\n==Supreme Federal Court==\n\n[[Image:Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Federal Court]] of Brazil]]\n\nThe [[Supreme Federal Court]] (''Supremo Tribunal Federal'') is the highest Brazilian Judiciary. Its main responsibility is to serve as the ultimate guardian of the Brazilian Constitution, with the roles of a [[constitutional court]].\n\nThe most common tool of that Court is the Extraordinary Appeal (''Recurso Extraordin\u00e1rio''), granted when judgements of second instance courts violate the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme court also holds the power to analyze the [[constitutionality]] of a federal or state law or statute, and thus making it invalid, through the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (''A\u00e7\u00e3o Declarat\u00f3ria de Inconstitucionalidade'').\n\nOther [[original jurisdiction]] includes the decision over [[extradition]].\n\nMembers are appointed by president and are approved by the federal senate.\n\n===National Justice Council===\n\nTogether with the Supreme Federal Court functions the [[National Justice Council]] (''Conselho Nacional de Justi\u00e7a''). Created in 2004 by the 45th [[Constitutional Amendment]], with headquarters in Bras\u00edlia, and national range actuation, have the objective to exercise administrative control over the Judiciary (except the Supreme Federal Court), planning and coordinating joint actions between the courts. It also has some disciplinary powers over judges, but cannot remove them from office, which can only be performed by their own Courts or by final decision on a judicial procedure.\n\n==Superior Court of Justice==\nThe [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]] (''Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a'') is the highest Brazilian court for non-constitutional issues concerning both states and Federal ordinary courts. It grants a Special Appeal (''{{ill|Recurso especial|pt}}'') when a judgement rendered by a court of second instance conflicts with a federal [[statute]] disposition or when two or more second instance courts rule differently on the same federal statute. Other roles include deciding most jurisdiction conflicts and granting the [[exequatur]] to foreign judicial decisions.\n\n==Federal Regional Courts==\n{{main|Regional Federal Courts}}\n\n{{Wikisourcelang|pt|Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o de 1988 da Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil/T\u00edtulo IV/III|Title IV of the Brazilian Consitution|<br/><small>(in Portuguese)</small>}}\nThere are five Federal Regional Courts ({{lang|pt|[[:pt:Tribunal Regional Federal|Tribunal Regional Federal]]}} - TRF), each covering several [[Brazilian states]]. They are established by articles 107 and 108 of the [[Brazilian Constitution|Constitution]]. Together with the Federal judges ({{lang|pt-br|ju\u00edzes federais}}), the Federal Regional Courts make up the {{ill|Federal Courts of Brazil|pt|Justi\u00e7a Federal|vertical-align=sup}}, which is part of the Judiciary branch. \n\nEach Federal Regional Court has seven (or more) judges of the [[Court of second instance|second instance]], named by the [[President of Brazil|President]], and holds court around the region of their jurisdiction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.direitonet.com.br/dicionario/exibir/1269/Tribunal-Regional-Federal-TRF|title=Tribunal Regional Federal - TRF |trans-title=Federal Regional Court |website=DireitoNet |date=31 May 2017 |language=pt-br |access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |lang=pt-br |url=https://www.jurisway.org.br/v2/pergunta.asp?idmodelo=6271 |title=Qual a fun\u00e7\u00e3o dos Tribunais Regionais? JurisWay Perguntas e Respostas |trans-title=What is the function of Regional Courts? Jurisway Q&A |website=www.jurisway.org.br |access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\n==Specialized courts==\n\n===Military courts===\nThey are the [[Court-martial|courts-martial]] of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]]. It is headed by the [[Superior Military Court]] (''Superior Tribunal Militar''). The courts are integrated by both civilian and military members.\n\n===Labor courts===\nThey have jurisdiction over [[labor law]] issues, including collective. They have no jurisdiction over civil servants, except some at municipal level and employees of government enterprises of a private nature, such as [[Petrobras]] and the [[Correios]].\n\nFirst instance courts (''varas do trabalho'') in major cities deal with workers' individual complaints, administrative matters concerning labour law and all issues that are not attributed to higher courts.\n\nThe second instance courts are the [[Regional Labor Courts]] (''Tribunais Regionais do Trabalho''), that deal with appeals. They also have direct jurisdiction over some matters of collective labour law, including solution of conflicts between [[trade unions]] and employers and the right to [[strike action|strike]].\n\nThe system is headed by the [[Superior Labor Court]], which functions as the highest appeal court for issues of labor law.\n\n===Electoral courts===\nThe Electoral court system of Brazil was created in 1932, in the intention to moralize{{what|date=January 2020}} the Brazilian electoral system. It was dissolved in 1937 then created again in 1945, and since then has been in continuous operation.\n\nThe existence of that court system is predicted in the Constitution, but the structure and roles defined in the Brazilian Electoral Code of 1964. Its typical judicial roles include judging electoral matters, both administrative and criminal, and also issues concerning political rights (not \"political crimes\" or \"responsibility crimes\").\n\nBut the peculiarity of that system is some extra judiciary roles. It includes organizing, executing and controlling all official political elections, and the proclamation of its result.\n\nThe system headed by the [[Supreme Electoral Court (Brazil)|Superior Electoral Court]], which controls the system, and has special responsibilities in defining rules and interpretations for the electoral procedure, and also judging appeals from Regional Courts. Its headquarters are located in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nEach state has a Regional Electoral Court, based in the capital city. It has special responsibilities over state level elections.\n\nAt local level there are the electoral judges and electoral councils. The electoral judges are appointed among state judges and, apart from some individual roles, presides the local electoral council, which is composed by other four appointed citizens.\n\nThe electoral courts have no magistrate career of its own. All judges are designated to serve for a two year term, and can be from magistrate careers from ordinary courts systems, or, in the case of Regional and Superior courts,{{what|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Ordinary courts==\n\n===State-level judiciary===\n[[Image:Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a de Pernambuco - Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Pernambuco Court of Justice]]]]\n\n====Trial courts====\nEach state territory is divided into judicial districts (''[[comarca]]s''), which are composed of one or more [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]]. Each judicial district has at least one trial court (''vara''), that function as a [[court of first instance]] for most cases. In large judicial districts, with two or more trial courts, there usually are specializations of the courts of first instance in terms of the subject, such as [[crime]] and [[family litigation]]. Judgments from the trial courts can be the subject of [[judicial review]] following appeals to the Courts of Justice.\n\nEach court of first instance has a judge and may have a substitute judge. The judge decides alone in civil cases and most of the criminal cases, except that a [[jury]] has jurisdiction over willful crimes against life (murder or attempted murder, [[infanticide]], [[abortion]] and suicide instigation or auxiliation).\n\n====Courts of Justice====\nThe highest court of a state judicial system is its court of second instance, the Courts of Justice. Each Brazilian State has only one Court of Justice (''Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a'' in Portuguese). They are courts of appeal, meaning they can review any decisions taken by trial courts, and have the final word on decisions of law at the state level. Some states, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]], used to have parallel [[Court of Appeals]] (''{{ill|Tribunal de Al\u00e7ada|pt|Juiz de al\u00e7ada}}'') with different jurisdiction. But the 45th [[Constitutional Amendment]] to the [[Brazilian Constitution]], in its article four, decreed their extinction in order to simplify the second instance structure.\n\nSecond instance judgments are usually made by three [[judge]]s, called ''desembargadores''. Large courts are usually divided into civil chambers, which judge civil cases, and criminal chambers.\n\nOther roles of Courts of Justice include the control over constitutionality of statutes passed by municipalities and the organization of the [[Civil law notary|notary]] and civil registration services.\n\nSome states also have separate military courts of justice that deal with military crimes and disciplinary matters of the state [[Military Police (Brazil)|military police]] and [[Military Firefighters Corps]].\n\n===Federal courts===\nThe jurisdiction of the federal court system is defined in articles 108 and 109 of the Brazilian Constitution:\n* Causes where the federal government, its agencies or enterprises have an interest, with the exception of bankruptcy and [[industrial injury]], which are in states' jurisdiction, and also respecting the specific jurisdiction of the labour and electoral courts, which prevails over federal ordinary courts jurisdiction;\n* Causes involving foreign governments or recognized international public organization;\n* Political crimes;\n* Crimes against the labour organization, including [[slavery]] (as decided in 2006 by the ''STF'');\n* Crimes committed aboard [[ship]]s or [[aircraft]];\n* [[Alien (law)|Foreigners]] and nationality rights;\n* [[Indigenous peoples]]' rights.\n\nAs in the states, there are first instance trial courts (''varas federais''), located in major cities, with jurisdiction divided in judicial districts (''se\u00e7\u00f5es'' and ''subse\u00e7\u00f5es'').\n\nThe second instance courts, Regional Federal Courts (''Tribunais Regionais Federais''), actually number five, and have jurisdiction over circuits of the several states.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Federal courts of Brazil]]\n* [[Judiciary of Portugal]]\n* [[Law of Brazil]]\n* [[Ministry of Justice (Brazil)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://redir.stf.jus.br/portalstfinternacional/principal!incr.action Supremo Tribunal Federal]\n*[http://www.cnj.jus.br/ Conselho Nacional de Justi\u00e7a] {{in lang|pt}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100525140044/http://www.stj.jus.br/portal_stj/publicacao/engine.wsp Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a] {{in lang|pt}}\n\n{{Brazil topics}}\n{{Judiciaries of South America}}\n\n[[Category:Judiciary of Brazil| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n{{rough translation|pt|Portugu\u00eas|reason=The original translation appears to have stabilized around June 201reflects the state of pt article from roughly May 2010, around the time of version [[:pt:Special:permalink/20248489|20248489]]. |date=December 2019}}\n{{Politics of Brazil}}\n\nThe '''Judiciary of Brazil''' is the group of public entities in which the Brazilian constitutional attribution of jurisdictional function occurs. It consists of five entities, namely: Supreme Federal Court (STF), Superior Court of Justice (STJ), federal regional courts and federal judges, military courts and judges, and courts and judges of states, the federal district and territories. The STF as well as the higher courts - as well as the Superior Labor Court (TST), the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Superior Military Court (STM) - are based in Brasilia, the Brazil's capital, and have jurisdiction throughout Brazil. Eleven ministers compose the Supreme Federal Court, whose main competence is to keep the constitution. 33 ministers form at least the STJ. \n\n==Overview==\nThe system is divided primarily into ordinary courts (''Justi\u00e7a comum'') and specialized courts (''Justi\u00e7a especializada'').\n\nThe specialized courts are federal  and are divided into three areas of practice: military courts, labor courts and electoral courts.\n\nThe ordinary courts are divided between federal and state judiciaries. The judiciary of the [[Brazilian Federal District]] has the same subject-matter jurisdiction as other ordinary state-level judiciaries over its territory, but is kept and organized by the federal government.\n\nMunicipalities hold no judicial powers.\n\nThe system also includes two special central courts that are separate from the other divisions: The [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] and the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]]. Both have headquarters in [[Bras\u00edlia]].\n\n==Supreme Federal Court==\n\n[[Image:Brazilian Supreme Federal Tribunal.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Federal Court]] of Brazil]]\n\nThe [[Supreme Federal Court]] (''Supremo Tribunal Federal'') is the highest Brazilian Judiciary. Its main responsibility is to serve as the ultimate guardian of the Brazilian Constitution, with the roles of a [[constitutional court]].\n\nThe most common tool of that Court is the Extraordinary Appeal (''Recurso Extraordin\u00e1rio''), granted when judgements of second instance courts violate the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme court also holds the power to analyze the [[constitutionality]] of a federal or state law or statute, and thus making it invalid, through the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (''A\u00e7\u00e3o Declarat\u00f3ria de Inconstitucionalidade'').\n\nOther [[original jurisdiction]] includes the decision over [[extradition]].\n\nMembers are appointed by president and are approved by the federal senate.\n\n===National Justice Council===\n\nTogether with the Supreme Federal Court functions the [[National Justice Council]] (''Conselho Nacional de Justi\u00e7a''). Created in 2004 by the 45th [[Constitutional Amendment]], with headquarters in Bras\u00edlia, and national range actuation, have the objective to exercise administrative control over the Judiciary (except the Supreme Federal Court), planning and coordinating joint actions between the courts. It also has some disciplinary powers over judges, but cannot remove them from office, which can only be performed by their own Courts or by final decision on a judicial procedure.\n\n==Superior Court of Justice==\nThe [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]] (''Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a'') is the highest Brazilian court for non-constitutional issues concerning both states and Federal ordinary courts. It grants a Special Appeal (''{{ill|Recurso especial|pt}}'') when a judgement rendered by a court of second instance conflicts with a federal [[statute]] disposition or when two or more second instance courts rule differently on the same federal statute. Other roles include deciding most jurisdiction conflicts and granting the [[exequatur]] to foreign judicial decisions.\n\n==Federal Regional Courts==\n{{main|Regional Federal Courts}}\n\n{{Wikisourcelang|pt|Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o de 1988 da Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil/T\u00edtulo IV/III|Title IV of the Brazilian Consitution|<br/><small>(in Portuguese)</small>}}\nThere are five Federal Regional Courts ({{lang|pt|[[:pt:Tribunal Regional Federal|Tribunal Regional Federal]]}} (TRF)), each covering several [[Brazilian states]]. They are established by articles 107 and 108 of the [[Brazilian Constitution|Constitution]]. Together with the Federal judges ({{lang|pt|juizos federales}}), the Federal Regional Courts  make up the {{ill|Federal Courts of Brazil|pt|Justi\u00e7a Federal|vertical-align=sup}}, which is part of the Judiciary branch.

It is headed by the [[Superior Military Court]] (''Superior Tribunal Militar''). The courts are integrated by both civilian and military members.\n\n===Labor courts===\nThey have jurisdiction over [[labor law]] issues, including collective. They have no jurisdiction over civil servants, except some at municipal level and employees of government enterprises of a private nature, such as [[Petrobras]] and the [[Correios]].\n\nFirst instance courts (''varas do trabalho'') in major cities deal with workers' individual complaints, administrative matters concerning labour law and all issues that are not attributed to higher courts.\n\nThe second instance courts are the [[Regional Labor Courts]] (''Tribunais Regionais do Trabalho''), that deal with appeals. They also have direct jurisdiction over some matters of collective labour law, including solution of conflicts between [[trade unions]] and employers and the right to [[strike action|strike]].\n\nThe system is headed by the [[Superior Labor Court]], which functions as the highest appeal court for issues of labor law.\n\n===Electoral courts===\nThe Electoral court system of Brazil was created in 1932, in the intention to moralize{{what|date=January 2020}} the Brazilian electoral system. It was dissolved in 1937 then created again in 1945, and since then has been in continuous operation.\n\nThe existence of that court system is predicted in the Constitution, but the structure and roles defined in the Brazilian Electoral Code of 1964. Its typical judicial roles include judging electoral matters, both administrative and criminal, and also issues concerning political rights (not \"political crimes\" or \"responsibility crimes\").\n\nBut the peculiarity of that system is some extra judiciary roles. It includes organizing, executing and controlling all official political elections, and the proclamation of its result.\n\nThe system headed by the [[Supreme Electoral Court (Brazil)|Superior Electoral Court]], which controls the system, and has special responsibilities in defining rules and interpretations for the electoral procedure, and also judging appeals from Regional Courts. Its headquarters are located in Bras\u00edlia.\n\nEach state has a Regional Electoral Court, based in the capital city. It has special responsibilities over state level elections.\n\nAt local level there are the electoral judges and electoral councils. The electoral judges are appointed among state judges and, apart from some individual roles, presides the local electoral council, which is composed by other four appointed citizens.\n\nThe electoral courts have no magistrate career of its own. All judges are designated to serve for a two year term, and can be from magistrate careers from ordinary courts systems, or, in the case of Regional and Superior courts,{{what|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Ordinary courts==\n\n===State-level judiciary===\n[[Image:Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a de Pernambuco - Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[Pernambuco Court of Justice]]]]\n\n====Trial courts====\nEach state territory is divided into judicial districts (''[[comarca]]s''), which are composed of one or more [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]]. Each judicial district has at least one trial court (''vara''), that function as a [[court of first instance]] for most cases. In large judicial districts, with two or more trial courts, there usually are specializations of the courts of first instance in terms of the subject, such as [[crime]] and [[family litigation]]. Judgments from the trial courts can be the subject of [[judicial review]] following appeals to the Courts of Justice.\n\nEach court of first instance has a judge and may have a substitute judge.

M. Sloop of War \u201cSir Isaac Brock\u201d, on the stocks (April, 1813).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Sir Issac Brock}} being built in York. Both sides engaged in building freshwater fleets in an effort to gain [[Engagements on Lake Ontario|naval supremacy in Lake Ontario]].]]\nYork, the capital of [[Upper Canada]], stood on the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. During the War of 1812, the lake was both the front line between Upper Canada and the United States, and served as the principal British supply line from [[Quebec City|Quebec]] to the various forces and outposts to the west. At the start of the war, the British had a small naval force, the [[Provincial Marine]], with which they seized control of the Lake Ontario, and [[Lake Erie]]. This made it possible because of Major General [[Isaac Brock]], who led British forces in Upper Canada to several important victories in 1812 by shifting his small force rapidly between threatened points to defeat disjointed American attacks individually.\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] appointed Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]] to regain control of the lakes. He created a squadron of fighting ships at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]] by purchasing and arming several lake schooners and laying down new purpose-built fighting vessels. However, no decisive action was possible before the onset of winter, during which the ships of both sides were confined to harbour by ice. To match Chauncey's shipbuilding efforts, the British laid down the [[sloop of war]], {{HMS|Wolfe|1813|2}}, at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]; and {{HMS|Sir Isaac Brock}}, at [[Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada)|York Naval Shipyards]].\n\n==Prelude==\n===American planning===\nOn January 13, 1813, [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] was appointed [[United States Secretary of War]]. Having been a serving soldier, he quickly appreciated the situation on Lake Ontario, and devised a plan by which a force of 7,000 regular soldiers would be concentrated at Sackett's Harbor on April 1. Working together with Chauncey's squadron, this force would capture Kingston before the [[Saint Lawrence River]] thawed and substantial British reinforcements could arrive in Upper Canada. The capture of Kingston and the destruction of the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard]] together with most of the vessels of the Provincial Marine, would make almost every British post west of Kingston vulnerable if not untenable.<ref>Hitsman, p. 136</ref> After Kingston was captured, the Americans would then capture the British positions at York and [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]].\n[[File:John Armstrong Jr Rembrandt Peale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[United States Secretary of War]] [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] originally planned for an attack on [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], but later acquiesced to changes that made [[York, Upper Canada|York]] the attack's target.]]\nArmstrong conferred with Major General [[Henry Dearborn]], commander of the American ''Army of the North'', at [[Albany, New York]] during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong's plan at this point, but they subsequently had second thoughts. That month, Lieutenant General Sir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], the British [[Governor General of Canada]], travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], who had succeeded Brock as [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Pr\u00e9vost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]] en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Pr\u00e9vost's arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett's Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.\n\nEven though Pr\u00e9vost soon returned to Lower Canada, and deserters and pro-American Canadian civilians reported that the true size of Kingston's garrison was 600 regulars and 1,400 militia,<ref name=Humphries254>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 254</ref> Chauncey and Dearborn chose to accept the earlier inflated figure. Furthermore, even after two brigades of troops under Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] reinforced the troops at Sackett's Harbor after a gruelling winter march from [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], the number of effective troops available to Dearborn fell far short of the 7,000 planned, mainly as a result of sickness and exposure. During March, Chauncey and Dearborn recommended to Armstrong that when the ice on the lake thawed, they should attack the less well-defended town of York instead of Kingston. Although York was the Provincial capital of Upper Canada, it was far less important than Kingston as a military objective. Historians such as John R. Elting have pointed out that this change of plan effectively reversed Armstrong's original strategy, and by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it left Sackett's Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.\n\nArmstrong, by now back in Washington, nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information.<ref>Elting, p. 94</ref> Armstrong also believed that an easy victory at York would provide the government with a significant propaganda coup, as well as bolster support for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] for the gubernational election in New York.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n\nThe attack was originally planned to commence in early April, although a long winter delayed the attack on York by several weeks, threatening the political value of such an attack. In an attempt to overcome these delays, Democratic-Republicans supporters circulated proclamations of victory prior to the battle to the New York electorate.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} The American naval squadron first attempted to depart from Sackets Harbor on April 23, 1813, although an incoming storm forced the squadron back to harbour, in order to wait out the storm. The squadron finally departed on April 24, 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}}\n\n===British preparations===\nThe town was not heavily fortified, with insufficient resources preventing the construction of necessary works needed to adequately defend it.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} As a result, Sheaffe had instructed government officials in early April 1813 to hide legislative papers in the forest and fields behind York, to ensure they would not be seized in the event of an attack.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n[[File:Design of the town of York blockhouses, 1799 -a.jpg|thumb|left|Designs of the [[blockhouse]]s that were built to defend York, c. 1799.]]\nYork's defences included the town's [[blockhouse]] situated near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]], blockhouses at [[Fort York]] garrison to the west of the town, and another [[Gibraltar Point Blockhouse|blockhouse at Gibraltar Point]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The settlement was also defended by three batteries at the fort and the nearby \"Government House Battery\" which mounted two 12-pounder guns.

Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove back Sheaffe's force. After Sheaffe failed to get the Fenicibles to renew their advance, the British force began to withdraw, with the newly arrived Glengarry Light Infantry covering the retreat.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}}\n\nDuring these landings, the American naval squadron bombarded the four gun batteries defending York.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, also bombarded the fort and Government House battery; with Chauncey himself was directing them from a small boat. British return fire was ineffective.\n[[File:Death of General Pike at the Battle of York.jpg|right|thumb|Brig. Gen.

The majority of American casualties originated from the explosion at the fort's powder magazine. An archaeological dig in 2012 unearthed evidence that the destruction of the magazine and the impact it had on American soldiers was a result of poor position, and bad luck.

The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because they believed that the ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}} Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia were held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth's company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as guard in the town. At this stage, few Americans had entered the town.\n\nThe next morning, the terms had still not been ratified, since Dearborn had refused to leave the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]''. When he eventually did, Reverend [[John Strachan]] (who held no official position other than [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of York at the time) first brusquely tried to force him to sign the articles for capitulation on the spot, then accused Chauncey to his face of delaying the capitulation to allow the American troops licence to commit outrages.<ref name=Humphries261>Charles W.

The official terms of surrender permitted civil servants to continue carrying out their duties, and surgeons to treat British wounded.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} As a part of the terms of surrender, any troops remaining in York became [[prisoners of war]], although those serving in the militia were \"paroled,\" allowing them to return home, so long as they not rejoin the conflict until an official prisoner exchange had secured their \"release\".{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} Members of the York Militia were ordered to relinquish their arms, and proceed to Fort York garrison. The officers of the militia were subsequently released on \"parole,\" although the rest of the militia remained imprisoned for two days.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}} Kept without food, water, or medical attention, the imprisoned militia was eventually released at the behest of Strachan.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}}\n\nThe Americans took over the dockyard, where they captured a brig ({{HMS|Duke of Gloucester|1807|2}}) in poor state of repair, and twenty 24-pounder [[carronade]]s and other stores intended for the British squadron on [[Lake Erie]]. ''Sir Isaac Brock'' was beyond salvage. The Americans had missed another ship-rigged vessel, {{ship||Prince Regent|1812 schooner|2}}, which carried 16 guns, as she sailed for Kingston to collect ordnance two days before the Americans had been sighted.<ref>Forester, p. 124</ref> The Americans also demanded and received several thousand pounds in Army Bills, which had been in the keeping of [[Prideaux Selby]], the Receiver General of Upper Canada, who was mortally ill.\n\n===Burning of York===\n[[File:First Upper Canada Parliament, destroyed in the war of 1812 -b.jpg|thumb|The first [[Ontario Legislative Building|building]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]], along with a number of other buildings was set ablaze in the days after the battle.]]\nBetween April 28 and 30, American troops carried out many acts of plunder. Some of them set fire to the [[Ontario Legislative Building#History|buildings]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], and [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], home to the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. It was alleged that the American troops had found a scalp there,<ref>Charles W.

Dearborn himself was embarrassed by the looting, as it made a mockery of the terms of surrender he arranged. His soldiers' disregard for the terms he arranged, and local civil leaders' continued protest against them, made Dearborn eager to leave York as soon as all the captured stores were transported.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Americans occupied the town for nearly two weeks. They sent the captured military stores, including 20 artillery pieces,{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} away on May 2 but were then penned in [[Toronto Harbour|York harbour]] by a gale. Chauncey's vessels were so overcrowded with troops that only half of them could go below decks to escape the rain at any time.{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=141}} They left York on May 8, departing for the [[Niagara peninsula]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} where they required several weeks to recuperate. Sheaffe's troops endured an equally miserable fourteen-day retreat overland to Kingston.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}}\n\nAround 300 to 400 [[Iroquois]] warriors assembled and marched towards York shortly after the battle, to launch an attack on the American garrison.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} They were only {{convert|50|km|mi}} west of York, in present day [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], when they learned that the Americans had departed York, and the expedition was called off.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}}\n\n===Effects on the war===\n[[File:Rogerhalesheaffe.jpg|thumb|upright|As a result of the battle, Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] was relieved of his military command in [[Upper Canada]].]]\nMany members of the Provincial Assembly and other prominent citizens severely criticized Sheaffe, both for his conduct generally and during the fighting at York. For example, Militia officers Chewitt and Allan, the Reverend Strachan and others wrote to Governor General Pr\u00e9vost on May 8, that Sheaffe \"...kept too far from his troops after retreating from the woods, never cheered or animated them, nor showed by his personal conduct that he was hearty in the cause.\"<ref>Hitsman, pp. 140, 333(en)</ref> Sheaffe lost his military and public offices in Upper Canada as the result of his defeat.\n\nHowever, the Americans had not inflicted crippling damage on the Provincial Marine on Lake Ontario, and they admitted that by preserving his small force of regulars rather than sacrificing them in a fight against heavy odds, Sheaffe had robbed them of decisive victory. Secretary of War Armstrong wrote, \"...we cannot doubt but that in all cases in which a British commander is compelled to act defensively, his policy will be that adopted by Sheaffe \u2013 to prefer the preservation of his troops to that of his post, and thus carrying off the kernel leave us the shell.\"<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe effects of the capture of York were probably most significant on [[Lake Erie]], since the capture of the ordnance and supplies destined for the British squadron there contributed to the defeat of the British squadron at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}} However, most of the naval supplies captured were not used by the Americans, who abandoned a portion of the captured goods before they departed from York, while the remaining supplies were set on fire during the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]] in May 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=64}}\n\n====Societal consequences====\nAs the American attack on York occurred on the first of New York's three-day election period, the battle did not directly benefit the Democratic-Republic Party as Armstrong had originally envisioned.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}} However, early proclamations of victory issued prior to the battle, did contribute to the reelection of [[Daniel D. Tompkins]], the Democratic-Republican candidate for the [[Governor of New York]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}}\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]], the battle, and occupation of York served as a watershed moment for the settlers of York. Those who fought the Americans became celebrated in the local community, while those who aided the occupation were viewed by the community as traitors.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=60}} The documentary film ''Explosion 1812'' argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, dogged resistance by militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion.<ref name=expl/>\n\nSeveral commentators viewed the American transgressions at York as justification for the British [[Burning of Washington]] later in the war. Pr\u00e9vost wrote that \"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\".{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=220}} Strachan wrote to [[Thomas Jefferson]] that the damage to Washington \"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\".{{sfn|Hitsman|Graves|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n==Later attacks==\n===Second incursion, July 1813===\nChauncey and Dearborn subsequently won the [[Battle of Fort George]] on the Niagara peninsula, but they had left Sacket's Harbor defended only by a few troops, mainly militia. When reinforcements from the [[Royal Navy]] commanded by Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] arrived in Kingston, Yeo almost immediately embarked some troops commanded by Pr\u00e9vost and attacked Sackett's Harbor. Although the British were repelled by the defenders at the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]], Chauncey immediately withdrew into Sacket's Harbor until mid-July, when a new heavy [[sloop of war]] had been completed.\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca.

The plaque reads:\n\n<blockquote>On the morning of July 31, 1813, a U.S. invasion fleet appeared off York (Toronto) after having withdrawn from a planned attack on British positions at Burlington Heights. That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York's militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators' reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River.

An American force supported by a naval flotilla landed on the lake shore to the west and advanced against the town, which was defended by an outnumbered force of regulars, militia and [[Ojibwe|Ojibway]] natives under the overall command of Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.\n\nSheaffe's forces were defeated and Sheaffe retreated with his surviving regulars to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], abandoning the militia and civilians. The Americans captured the fort, town and the dockyard. They themselves suffered heavy casualties, including force leader Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] and others killed when the retreating British blew up the fort's magazine.<ref name=peppiatt>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto|access-date=August 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606040800/http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|archive-date=June 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The American forces subsequently carried out several acts of arson and looting in the town before withdrawing.\n\nThough the Americans won a clear victory, it did not have decisive strategic results as York was a less important objective in military terms than Kingston, where the British armed vessels on Lake Ontario were based.\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:H. M. Sloop of War \u201cSir Isaac Brock\u201d, on the stocks (April, 1813).jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Sir Issac Brock}} being built in York. Both sides engaged in building freshwater fleets in an effort to gain [[Engagements on Lake Ontario|naval supremacy in Lake Ontario]].]]\nYork, the capital of [[Upper Canada]], stood on the north shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. During the War of 1812, the lake was both the front line between Upper Canada and the United States, and served as the principal British supply line from [[Quebec City|Quebec]] to the various forces and outposts to the west. At the start of the war, the British had a small naval force, the [[Provincial Marine]], with which they seized control of the Lake Ontario, and [[Lake Erie]]. This made it possible because of Major General [[Isaac Brock]], who led British forces in Upper Canada to several important victories in 1812 by shifting his small force rapidly between threatened points to defeat disjointed American attacks individually.\n\nThe [[United States Navy]] appointed Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]] to regain control of the lakes. He created a squadron of fighting ships at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]] by purchasing and arming several lake schooners and laying down new purpose-built fighting vessels. However, no decisive action was possible before the onset of winter, during which the ships of both sides were confined to harbour by ice. To match Chauncey's shipbuilding efforts, the British laid down the [[sloop of war]], {{HMS|Wolfe|1813|2}}, at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]]; and {{HMS|Sir Isaac Brock}}, at [[Naval Shipyards, York (Upper Canada)|York Naval Shipyards]].\n\n==Prelude==\n===American planning===\nOn January 13, 1813, [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] was appointed [[United States Secretary of War]]. Having been a serving soldier, he quickly appreciated the situation on Lake Ontario, and devised a plan by which a force of 7,000 regular soldiers would be concentrated at Sackett's Harbor on April 1. Working together with Chauncey's squadron, this force would capture Kingston before the [[Saint Lawrence River]] thawed and substantial British reinforcements could arrive in Upper Canada. The capture of Kingston and the destruction of the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard]] together with most of the vessels of the Provincial Marine, would make almost every British post west of Kingston vulnerable if not untenable.<ref>Hitsman, p. 136</ref> After Kingston was captured, the Americans would then capture the British positions at York and [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]], at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]].\n[[File:John Armstrong Jr Rembrandt Peale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[United States Secretary of War]] [[John Armstrong, Jr.]] originally planned for an attack on [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], but later acquiesced to changes that made [[York, Upper Canada|York]] the attack's target.]]\nArmstrong conferred with Major General [[Henry Dearborn]], commander of the American ''Army of the North'', at [[Albany, New York]] during February. Both Dearborn and Chauncey agreed with Armstrong's plan at this point, but they subsequently had second thoughts. That month, Lieutenant General Sir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], the British [[Governor General of Canada]], travelled up the frozen Saint Lawrence to visit Upper Canada. This visit was made necessary because Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]], who had succeeded Brock as [[Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada]], was ill and unable to perform his various duties. Pr\u00e9vost was accompanied only by a few small detachments of reinforcements, which participated in the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]] en route. Nevertheless, both Chauncey and Dearborn believed that Pr\u00e9vost's arrival indicated an imminent attack on Sackett's Harbor, and reported that Kingston now had a garrison of 6,000 or more British regulars.\n\nEven though Pr\u00e9vost soon returned to Lower Canada, and deserters and pro-American Canadian civilians reported that the true size of Kingston's garrison was 600 regulars and 1,400 militia,<ref name=Humphries254>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 254</ref> Chauncey and Dearborn chose to accept the earlier inflated figure. Furthermore, even after two brigades of troops under Brigadier General [[Zebulon Pike]] reinforced the troops at Sackett's Harbor after a gruelling winter march from [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]], the number of effective troops available to Dearborn fell far short of the 7,000 planned, mainly as a result of sickness and exposure. During March, Chauncey and Dearborn recommended to Armstrong that when the ice on the lake thawed, they should attack the less well-defended town of York instead of Kingston. Although York was the Provincial capital of Upper Canada, it was far less important than Kingston as a military objective. Historians such as John R. Elting have pointed out that this change of plan effectively reversed Armstrong's original strategy, and by committing the bulk of the American forces at the western end of Lake Ontario, it left Sackett's Harbor vulnerable to an attack by British reinforcements arriving from Lower Canada.\n\nArmstrong, by now back in Washington, nevertheless acquiesced in this change of plan as Dearborn might well have better local information.<ref>Elting, p. 94</ref> Armstrong also believed that an easy victory at York would provide the government with a significant propaganda coup, as well as bolster support for the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] for the gubernational election in New York.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n\nThe attack was originally planned to commence in early April, although a long winter delayed the attack on York by several weeks, threatening the political value of such an attack. In an attempt to overcome these delays, Democratic-Republicans supporters circulated proclamations of victory prior to the battle to the New York electorate.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} The American naval squadron first attempted to depart from Sackets Harbor on April 23, 1813, although an incoming storm forced the squadron back to harbour, in order to wait out the storm. The squadron finally departed on April 24, 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}}\n\n===British preparations===\nThe town was not heavily fortified, with insufficient resources preventing the construction of necessary works needed to adequately defend it.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}} As a result, Sheaffe had instructed government officials in early April 1813 to hide legislative papers in the forest and fields behind York, to ensure they would not be seized in the event of an attack.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=49}}\n[[File:Design of the town of York blockhouses, 1799 -a.jpg|thumb|left|Designs of the [[blockhouse]]s that were built to defend York, c. 1799.]]\nYork's defences included the town's [[blockhouse]] situated near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]], blockhouses at [[Fort York]] garrison to the west of the town, and another [[Gibraltar Point Blockhouse|blockhouse at Gibraltar Point]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The settlement was also defended by three batteries at the fort and the nearby \"Government House Battery\" which mounted two 12-pounder guns. Another battery, known as the Western Battery was located {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1}} west of the fort, in present day [[Exhibition Place]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} The crude Western Battery had two obsolete 18-pounder [[artillery|guns]]. These guns originated from earlier conflicts, and had been disabled by having their [[trunnion]]s removed, but they were fixed to crude log carriages and could still be fired.<ref name=Hitsman138>Hitsman, p. 138</ref>\n\nFort York was also defended by a western wall, and a small unarmed [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] between the fort and the Western Battery.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} About a dozen cannons, including older condemned models, were mounted in these positions, in addition to two-6-pounders on field carriages.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Further west were the ruins of [[Fort Rouill\u00e9]], and the Half Moon Battery, neither of which was in use.<ref name=Humphries254/>\n\nSheaffe was at York to conduct public business. He was originally scheduled to leave the settlement for [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] but had postponed his departure due to suspicions of an American assault on York.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} His regulars, most of whom were also passing through York en route to other posts,{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=41\u201342}} consisted of two companies (including the grenadier company) of the 1st battalion [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]], a company of the [[Glengarry Light Infantry|Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles]], a company-sized detachment of the [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Royal Newfoundland Fencibles]],{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=138}} a small squad from the [[49th Regiment of Foot]], and thirteen soldiers from the [[Royal Artillery]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} There were also 40 or 50 [[Mississaugas]] and [[Ojibwe]] warriors, and the [[Canadian militia]]. The Militia was ordered to assemble, but only 300 of the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the [[York Militia]], and the Incorporated Militia,{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} could be mustered at short notice.\n[[File:Battle of York.jpg|thumb|The blockhouse near the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] in 1813. Most of the militia, and the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot|8th Regiment of Foot]] were positioned there prior to the battle.]]\nThe American naval squadron was spotted by British sentries posted at the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] on April 26, who alerted the town and its defenders using [[flag signals]] and signal guns.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=50}} Sheaffe expected the Americans to launch a two-pronged attack, with the main American landing to the west of Fort York, and another landing in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] to cut off a potential retreat to Kingston. To counteract this, Sheaffe concentrated his forces at Fort York, and the town's blockhouse. Most of his [[regular army|regulars]], [[Fencibles]], [[First Nations|Native]] warriors, and a small number of militiamen assembled at the fort, while most of the militia and the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot positioned themselves at the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\n==Battle==\nThe Americans appeared off York late on April 26. Chauncey's squadron consisted of a ship-rigged [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and twelve [[schooner]]s. The embarked force commanded by Brigadier General Zebulon Pike numbered between 1,600 and 1,800, mainly from the 6th, 15th, 16th and 21st U.S. Infantry, and the 3rd U.S. Artillery fighting as infantry.<ref>Colonel [[Ichabod Crane (Colonel)|Ichabod Crane]] commanded Company B, 3rd U.S. Artillery.</ref> Dearborn, the overall army commander, remained aboard the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]'' during the action. \n\nEarly on April 27, the first American wave of boats, carrying 300 soldiers of Major [[Benjamin Forsyth]]'s company of the [[1st Regiment of Riflemen|U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment]], landed about {{convert|6.4|km|mi|0}} west of the town, supported by some of Chauncey's schooners firing [[grapeshot]]. The American force intended to land at a clear field, west of Fort York, although strong winds pushed their landing crafts {{convert|3.2|km|mi|0}} west of their desired landing site, towards a wooded coastline.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Forsyth's riflemen were opposed only by Native warriors, led by [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]] [[James Givins]], as well as the grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot, who were dispatched to the area by Sheaffe.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} The Native force was the only force that initially engaged the American landing. With American cannon fire threatening the roads on the waterfront, the British units dispatched from Fort York had to traverse through the forest behind the waterfront; and were unable to reach the landing site before the Americans started their landings.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n[[File:Battle of York II.jpg|thumb|left|330px|Position of the American and British forces at York during the American landing.<ref name=Lossing>{{Cite book |last=Lossing |first=Benson |title=The Pictorial Field-Book of the War of 1812 |publisher=Harper & Brothers, Publishers |year=1868 |page=590}}</ref>]]\nSheaffe had also ordered a company of the Glengarry Light Infantry to support the Native force at the landing, but they became lost in the outskirts of the town, having been misdirected by Major-General [[\u00c6neas Shaw]], the [[Adjutant General]] of the Canadian Militia, who took some of the militia north onto [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] to prevent any wide American [[flanking maneuver]].<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 255</ref> After it became apparent that no landing would occur east of the settlement, Sheaffe recalled the companies of the 8th Regiment of Foot from the town's blockhouse.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=51}}\n\nAs the landings progressed, the British-Native force was outflanked and began to fall back into the woods. The US 15th Infantry Regiment was the second American unit to land, with bayonets fixed, under a hail of fire, shortly followed by Pike, who assumed personal command of the landing.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Sheaffe arrived with the rest of the 8th Regiment of Foot, the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles, and a few dozen militiamen, after the US 15th Infantry Regiment's had landed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} The grenadier company of the 8th Regiment of Foot charged them with the [[bayonet]].<ref name=Hitsman138/> The grenadiers were already outnumbered and were repulsed with heavy loss. Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove back Sheaffe's force. After Sheaffe failed to get the Fenicibles to renew their advance, the British force began to withdraw, with the newly arrived Glengarry Light Infantry covering the retreat.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}}\n\nDuring these landings, the American naval squadron bombarded the four gun batteries defending York.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Chauncey's schooners, most of which carried a long 24-pounder or 32-pounder cannon, also bombarded the fort and Government House battery; with Chauncey himself was directing them from a small boat. British return fire was ineffective.\n[[File:Death of General Pike at the Battle of York.jpg|right|thumb|Brig. Gen. [[Zebulon Pike]] was mortally wounded near the end of the battle, struck by debris from an explosion set off at the [[Fort York|fort]]'s magazine.]]\n\nThe British tried to rally around the Western battery, but the battery's travelling magazine (a portable chest containing cartridges) exploded, apparently as the result of an accident.<ref>Hitsman, p. 332, fn</ref> This caused further loss (including 20 killed) and confusion among the British regulars, and they fell back to a ravine north of the fort, where the militia were forming up at [[Garrison Creek (Ontario)|Garrison Creek]].{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} Sheaffe decided that the battle was lost and ordered the regulars to retreat, setting fire to the wooden bridge over the River Don east of the town to thwart pursuit.

Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 258</ref> Sheaffe instructed the militia to make the best terms they could with the Americans, but without informing the senior militia officers or any official of the legislature, he also dispatched Captain Tito LeLi\u00e8vre of the Royal Newfoundland<ref name=Malcomson215>Malcomson, ''Capital in Flames'', p. 215</ref> to set fire to the sloop of war HMS ''Sir Isaac Brock'' under construction at York's Naval Shipyard, and to blow up the fort's magazine.<ref name=Hitsman140>Hitsman, p. 140</ref><ref name=Malcomson225>Malcomson, ''Capital in Flames'', p. 225</ref>\n\nBy 1:00 pm, the Americans were {{convert|200|yd|m|0}} from the fort, and preparing to bombard the fort, in conjunction with the naval squadron.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=83}} The British had left the flag flying over the fort as a ruse, and Pike was questioning a prisoner as to how many troops were defending it. However, shortly after the bombardment began, the 300 barrels of gunpowder from the fort's magazine exploded.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} Rigged to explode by the retreating British, the resulting explosion threw debris over a {{convert|500|yd|m|1}} radius.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} Pike was mortally injured by flying stones and debris. The explosion also killed 37 other American soldiers, and wounded 222.<ref>Malcomson, ''Lords of the Lake'', p. 107</ref>\n\n===Casualties===\nThe American loss for the entire battle was officially reported as 52 killed and 254 wounded for the Army and 3 killed and 11 wounded for the Navy, for a total of 55 killed and 265 wounded. The majority of American casualties originated from the explosion at the fort's powder magazine. An archaeological dig in 2012 unearthed evidence that the destruction of the magazine and the impact it had on American soldiers was a result of poor position, and bad luck. The Americans just happened to be at the exact distance of the shock wave and its debris field.<ref name=expl>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/16/war-of-1812-explodes-on-tv/|title=War of 1812 explodes on TV|date=June 16, 2012|website=News.nationalpost.com|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe British loss was officially reported by Sheaffe as 59 killed, 34 wounded, 43 wounded prisoners, 10 captured and 7 missing, for a total of 153 casualties.<ref name=\"Cruikshank215-216\">Cruikshank, pp. 215\u2013216</ref> However, historian Robert Malcomson has found this return to be inaccurate: it did not include militia, sailors, dockyard workers or Native Americans and was incorrect even as to the casualties of the regulars. Malcomson demonstrates that the actual British loss was 82 killed, 43 wounded, 69 wounded prisoners, 274 captured and 7 missing, for a total of 475 casualties.<ref name=Malcomson393/>\n\n==Surrender==\n[[File:Sir John Beverley Robinson.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Captain [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|John Robinson]] of the [[York Militia]].

The process took time. The Americans were angry over their losses, particularly because they believed that the ship and fort had been destroyed after negotiations for surrender had already begun.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}} Nevertheless, Colonel Mitchell of the 3rd U.S. Artillery agreed to terms. While they waited for Dearborn and Chauncey to ratify the terms, the surrendered militia were held prisoner in a blockhouse without food or medical attention for the few wounded. Forsyth's company of the 1st U.S. Rifle Regiment was left as guard in the town. At this stage, few Americans had entered the town.\n\nThe next morning, the terms had still not been ratified, since Dearborn had refused to leave the corvette ''[[USS Madison (1812)|Madison]]''. When he eventually did, Reverend [[John Strachan]] (who held no official position other than [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of York at the time) first brusquely tried to force him to sign the articles for capitulation on the spot, then accused Chauncey to his face of delaying the capitulation to allow the American troops licence to commit outrages.<ref name=Humphries261>Charles W.

The official terms of surrender permitted civil servants to continue carrying out their duties, and surgeons to treat British wounded.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} As a part of the terms of surrender, any troops remaining in York became [[prisoners of war]], although those serving in the militia were \"paroled,\" allowing them to return home, so long as they not rejoin the conflict until an official prisoner exchange had secured their \"release\".{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=58}} Members of the York Militia were ordered to relinquish their arms, and proceed to Fort York garrison. The officers of the militia were subsequently released on \"parole,\" although the rest of the militia remained imprisoned for two days.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}} Kept without food, water, or medical attention, the imprisoned militia was eventually released at the behest of Strachan.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=60}}\n\nThe Americans took over the dockyard, where they captured a brig ({{HMS|Duke of Gloucester|1807|2}}) in poor state of repair, and twenty 24-pounder [[carronade]]s and other stores intended for the British squadron on [[Lake Erie]]. ''Sir Isaac Brock'' was beyond salvage. The Americans had missed another ship-rigged vessel, {{ship||Prince Regent|1812 schooner|2}}, which carried 16 guns, as she sailed for Kingston to collect ordnance two days before the Americans had been sighted.<ref>Forester, p. 124</ref> The Americans also demanded and received several thousand pounds in Army Bills, which had been in the keeping of [[Prideaux Selby]], the Receiver General of Upper Canada, who was mortally ill.\n\n===Burning of York===\n[[File:First Upper Canada Parliament, destroyed in the war of 1812 -b.jpg|thumb|The first [[Ontario Legislative Building|building]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]], along with a number of other buildings was set ablaze in the days after the battle.]]\nBetween April 28 and 30, American troops carried out many acts of plunder. Some of them set fire to the [[Ontario Legislative Building#History|buildings]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], and [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], home to the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. It was alleged that the American troops had found a scalp there,<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 264</ref> though folklore had it that the \"scalp\" was actually the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker]]'s wig. The Parliamentary [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] of Upper Canada was taken back to Washington and was only returned in 1934 as a goodwill gesture by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speaker.ontla.on.ca/en/at-the-assembly/the-mace/|title=The Mace - The Speaker|website=Speaker.ontla.on.ca|accessdate=May 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213050716/http://speaker.ontla.on.ca/en/at-the-assembly/the-mace/|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Printing Office, used for publishing official documents as well as newspapers, was vandalized and the printing press was smashed. Other Americans looted empty houses on the pretext that their absent owners were militia who had not given their parole as required by the articles of capitulation. The homes of Canadians connected with the Natives, including that of James Givins, were also looted regardless of their owners' status.<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 265</ref> Sheaffe was later to allege that local settlers had unlawfully come into possession of Government-owned farming tools or other stores looted and discarded by the Americans, and demanded that they be handed back.<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, pp. 267\u2013268</ref>\n\nDuring the looting, several officers under Chauncey's command took books from York's first subscription library. After finding out his officers were in possession of looted library books, Chauncey had the books packed in two crates, and returned to York. However, by the time the books arrived, the library had closed, and the books were auctioned off in 1822.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/local-history-genealogy/2018/11/the-battle-of-york-april-1813.html|title=War of 1812: The Battle of York|publisher=Toronto Public Library|year=2019|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe looting of York occurred in spite of Pike's earlier orders that outlined all civilian property be respected, with any soldier convicted of such transgressions be executed.{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=82}} Dearborn similarly emphatically denied giving orders for any buildings to be destroyed and deplored the worst of the atrocities in his letters, but he was nonetheless unable or unwilling to rein in his soldiers. Dearborn himself was embarrassed by the looting, as it made a mockery of the terms of surrender he arranged. His soldiers' disregard for the terms he arranged, and local civil leaders' continued protest against them, made Dearborn eager to leave York as soon as all the captured stores were transported.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Americans occupied the town for nearly two weeks. They sent the captured military stores, including 20 artillery pieces,{{sfn|Blumberg|2012|p=84}} away on May 2 but were then penned in [[Toronto Harbour|York harbour]] by a gale. Chauncey's vessels were so overcrowded with troops that only half of them could go below decks to escape the rain at any time.{{sfn|Hitsman|1995|p=141}} They left York on May 8, departing for the [[Niagara peninsula]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} where they required several weeks to recuperate. Sheaffe's troops endured an equally miserable fourteen-day retreat overland to Kingston.{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=118}}\n\nAround 300 to 400 [[Iroquois]] warriors assembled and marched towards York shortly after the battle, to launch an attack on the American garrison.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}} They were only {{convert|50|km|mi}} west of York, in present day [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], when they learned that the Americans had departed York, and the expedition was called off.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=62}}\n\n===Effects on the war===\n[[File:Rogerhalesheaffe.jpg|thumb|upright|As a result of the battle, Major General [[Roger Hale Sheaffe]] was relieved of his military command in [[Upper Canada]].]]\nMany members of the Provincial Assembly and other prominent citizens severely criticized Sheaffe, both for his conduct generally and during the fighting at York. For example, Militia officers Chewitt and Allan, the Reverend Strachan and others wrote to Governor General Pr\u00e9vost on May 8, that Sheaffe \"...kept too far from his troops after retreating from the woods, never cheered or animated them, nor showed by his personal conduct that he was hearty in the cause.\"<ref>Hitsman, pp. 140, 333(en)</ref> Sheaffe lost his military and public offices in Upper Canada as the result of his defeat.\n\nHowever, the Americans had not inflicted crippling damage on the Provincial Marine on Lake Ontario, and they admitted that by preserving his small force of regulars rather than sacrificing them in a fight against heavy odds, Sheaffe had robbed them of decisive victory. Secretary of War Armstrong wrote, \"...we cannot doubt but that in all cases in which a British commander is compelled to act defensively, his policy will be that adopted by Sheaffe \u2013 to prefer the preservation of his troops to that of his post, and thus carrying off the kernel leave us the shell.\"<ref>Charles W. Humphries, \"The Capture of York\", in Zaslow, p. 269</ref>\n\nThe effects of the capture of York were probably most significant on [[Lake Erie]], since the capture of the ordnance and supplies destined for the British squadron there contributed to the defeat of the British squadron at the [[Battle of Lake Erie]].{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=59}} However, most of the naval supplies captured were not used by the Americans, who abandoned a portion of the captured goods before they departed from York, while the remaining supplies were set on fire during the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]] in May 1813.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=64}}\n\n====Societal consequences====\nAs the American attack on York occurred on the first of New York's three-day election period, the battle did not directly benefit the Democratic-Republic Party as Armstrong had originally envisioned.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}} However, early proclamations of victory issued prior to the battle, did contribute to the reelection of [[Daniel D. Tompkins]], the Democratic-Republican candidate for the [[Governor of New York]].{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=63}}\n\nAccording to [[Pierre Berton]], the battle, and occupation of York served as a watershed moment for the settlers of York. Those who fought the Americans became celebrated in the local community, while those who aided the occupation were viewed by the community as traitors.{{sfn|Berton|2011|p=60}} The documentary film ''Explosion 1812'' argues that the battle had a much greater impact than previously assumed. The mistreatment by US forces of the civilian Canadian population, dogged resistance by militia and the burning of British symbols and buildings after the battle led to a hardening of Canadian popular opinion.<ref name=expl/>\n\nSeveral commentators viewed the American transgressions at York as justification for the British [[Burning of Washington]] later in the war. Pr\u00e9vost wrote that \"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate\".{{sfn|Elting|1995|p=220}} Strachan wrote to [[Thomas Jefferson]] that the damage to Washington \"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada\".{{sfn|Hitsman|Graves|1999|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n==Later attacks==\n===Second incursion, July 1813===\nChauncey and Dearborn subsequently won the [[Battle of Fort George]] on the Niagara peninsula, but they had left Sacket's Harbor defended only by a few troops, mainly militia. When reinforcements from the [[Royal Navy]] commanded by Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] arrived in Kingston, Yeo almost immediately embarked some troops commanded by Pr\u00e9vost and attacked Sackett's Harbor. Although the British were repelled by the defenders at the [[Second Battle of Sacket's Harbor]], Chauncey immediately withdrew into Sacket's Harbor until mid-July, when a new heavy [[sloop of war]] had been completed.\n\n[[File:Winfield Scott, ca.

The last remaining troop in York, members of the [[19th Light Dragoons]], collected the military supplies they could carry, and withdrew along the Don River.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} The American landing of 340 men at York was unopposed, with the American force burning the barracks at the fort, the military fuel yards, and looted several properties.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} They also seized 11 [[bateau|batteaux]], 5 cannons and some flour, before reembarking on their ships, leaving the settlement later that night.{{sfn|Benn|1993|p=68}} The library books that were looted from the battle in April 1813, were returned to the settlement during the second incursion into York.\n\nThe Ontario Heritage Foundation erected a plaque in 1968 near the entrance to Coronation Park, Exhibition Place, [[Lake Shore Boulevard]], in commemoration of the event. The plaque reads:\n\n<blockquote>On the morning of July 31, 1813, a U.S. invasion fleet appeared off York (Toronto) after having withdrawn from a planned attack on British positions at Burlington Heights. That afternoon 300 American soldiers came ashore near here. Their landing was unopposed: there were no British regulars in town, and York's militia had withdrawn from further combat in return for its freedom during the American invasion three months earlier. The invaders seized food and military supplies, then re-embarked. The next day they returned to investigate collaborators' reports that valuable stores were concealed up the Don River. Unsuccessful in their search, the Americans contented themselves with burning military installations on nearby Gibraltar Point before they departed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090950/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=4534|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015|title=DHH - Memorials Details Search Results|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Third incursion, August 1814===\nIn the months after the second American incursion into York, the defences around the harbour were significantly improved, as the British needed to protect a four-vessel squadron that would be stationed at the town's harbour.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} On August 6, 1814, the American Lake Ontario squadron pursued [[Governor Simcoe (1793 ship)|HMS ''Magnet'']], before its captain set fire to the ship, preventing its capture.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}} Suspecting the ship sailed from York, the American naval squadron made its way to the settlement in order to evaluate the situation, and if any more ships may be captured there.{{sfn|Benn|1993|72}}\n\nArriving near York's harbour, the American squadron dispatched {{USS|Lady of the Lake|1813|6}} to negotiate under a [[white flag]], in a ploy to evaluate the town's defences. However, the militia stationed at Fort York opened fire at the schooner, who returned fire, before withdrawing to rejoin the American squadron.{{sfn|Benn|1993|73}} The 8th Regiment of Foot, and the [[82nd Regiment of Foot]] were sent to York in an effort to bolster the town's defences. The American squadron did not attempt to engage the newly built defences, although they remained outside York's harbour for the next three days before sailing away.{{sfn|Benn|1993|73}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe burning and looting of York after the battle, along with the destruction of other Upper Canadian settlements during the war, saw public opinions on Americans shift among the residents of Upper Canada.

The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.

The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]].

In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism. At their confluence the Yamuna is larger than the Ganges, contributing about {{convert|2950|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} or about 58.5% of the combined flow.{{sfn|Gupta|2007|page=347}}\n\nNow flowing east, the river meets the [[Tamsa River]] (also called ''Tons''), which flows north from the [[Kaimur Range]] and contributes an average flow of about {{convert|190|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]].

She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.<ref name=darian2001-p114/> The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119\u201320}}</ref> The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.<ref name=pal-1997-p43/> (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)\n\nThe ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.<ref name=darian-2001-p125>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}</ref> Appearing first also in the relief in the Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, in the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.
