{"title_page": "Landing page", "text_new": "In online marketing, a '''landing page''', sometimes known as a \"'''lead capture page'''\", \"'''static page'''\", or a \"'''destination page'''\", is a single web page that appears in response to clicking on a search engine optimized search result, marketing promotion, marketing email, or an online advertisement. The landing page will usually display directed sales copy that is a logical extension of the advertisement, search result or link. Landing pages are used for lead generation. The actions that a visitor takes on a landing page is what determines an advertiser's conversion rate. A landing page may be part of a microsite or a single page within an organization's main web site.\n\nLanding pages are often linked to social media, e-mail campaigns or search engine marketing campaigns in order to enhance the effectiveness of the advertisements. The general goal of a landing page is to convert site visitors into sales or leads. If the goal is to obtain a lead, the landing page will include some method for the visitor to get into contact with the company, usually a phone number, or an inquiry form. If a sale is required, the landing page will usually have a link for the visitor to click, which will then send them to a shopping cart or a checkout area. By analyzing activity generated by the linked URL, marketers can use click-through rates and conversion rate to determine the success of an advertisement.\n\n==Types==\nThere are two types of landing pages: ''reference'' and ''transactional''.\n\n===References===\nA ''reference'' landing page presents information that is relevant to the visitor.

This is accomplished by providing a form that needs to be filled out. The visitor information is obtained in order to add the visitor's email address to a mailing list as a prospect. An email campaign can then be developed based on responses to transactional landing pages. The goal is to capture as much information about the visitor as possible. The ultimate goal is to convert the visitor into a customer. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n=== Origin ===\n\nLanding pages originated with the IT departments of [[Microsoft]] in late 2003 in response to poor online sales of [[Microsoft Office|Office]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://blog.omniconvert.com/the-history-of-the-landing-pages.html|title=The History Of Landing Pages - Omniconvert Blog|date=2016-08-17|work=Omniconvert Conversion Rate Optimization Blog|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The process was tedious and time-consuming. As a result, in 2009, several startups, including [[Unbounce]], were formed to simplify and streamline the process. The rise of [[cloud computing]] and [[e-commerce]] around 2009 provided ideal conditions for these startups to flourish.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then the customer requirements changed, requesting integrations with other solutions such as [[email marketing]], lead nurturing and [[customer relationship management]] systems.\n\n===Typical format===\nLanding pages often contain clear, concise action-oriented headlines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/best-selling-headline-david-ogilvys-copywriting-career-7-others/|title=The Best Selling Headline Of David Ogilvy's Copywriting Career (and 7 others!) - Word-of-Mouth and Referral Marketing Blog|website=www.referralcandy.com|publisher=Visakan Veerasamy blog editor at ReferralCandy|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-31|date=2014-06-04}}</ref> A good landing page explains the product offer in a clear manner and places visual emphasis on the value of the product or service presented.\n\nMarketing experts recommend websites remove the navigation menu and limit internal and external links on the page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/63081/website-conversions-landing-pages/|title=Increase Conversions By Maximizing Your Website Landing Pages|date=2017-01-05|work=The Financial Brand|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref> Any signup forms on the landing page should reflect the value of the offer. For example, a free offer or newsletter sign up form may only request an email address, whereas high value offers may have longer forms with more details required. They may also include a relevant image, animation or short video. These pages also tend to contain small icons (i.e. of [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]]) to facilitate [[social media]] sharing.\n\n==Landing page optimization==\n''Landing page optimization'' (LPO) is one part of a broader [[Internet marketing]] process called [[conversion optimization]], or conversion rate optimization (CRO), with the goal of improving the percentage of visitors to the website that become sales leads and customers. A landing page is a webpage that is displayed when a potential customer clicks an [[advertisement]] or a [[search engine]] result link. This webpage typically displays content that is a relevant extension of the advertisement or link. LPO aims to provide page content and appearance that makes the webpage more appealing to target audiences.\n\nThere are three major types of LPO based on [[targeting (advertising)|targeting]]:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/07363760910965882|title=Integrating science into web design: Consumer\u2010driven web site optimization|year=2009|last1=Gofman|first1=Alex|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Howard R.|last3=Mets|first3=T\u00f5nis|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=4|pages=286\u2013298}}.</ref>\n# '''Associative content targeting''' (also called ''rule-based optimization'' or ''passive targeting''). The page content is modified based on information obtained about the visitor's search criteria, geographic information of source traffic, or other known generic parameters that can be used for explicit non-research-based consumer [[market segmentation|segmentation]].\n# '''Predictive content targeting''' (also called ''active targeting''). The page content is adjusted by correlating any known information about the visitor (e.g., prior purchase behavior, personal demographic information, browsing patterns, etc.) to anticipate (desired) future actions based on [[predictive analytics]].\n# '''Consumer directed targeting''' (also called ''social targeting''). The page content is created using the relevance of publicly available information through a mechanism based on reviews, ratings, [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], referrals, etc.\n\nThere are two major types of LPO based on experimentation:\n# '''Closed-ended experimentation'''. Consumers are exposed to several variations of landing pages, altering elements like headlines, formatting and layout while their behavior is observed in an attempt to remove distractions that will take the lead away from the page, including the primary navigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.teknicks.com/make-your-landing-pages-convert-faster-than-a-cheetah-on-steroids#.U-T5tmOO2So|title=How To Create Landing Pages That Will Increase Your Conversion Rate|first=Matthew|last=Campion|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> At the conclusion of the experiment, an optimal page is selected based on the outcome of the experiment.\n# '''Open-ended experimentation'''. This approach is similar to closed-ended experimentation except that more variations will be added for testing and experimentation will not stop when a winner is found. This method is used by large corporation to dynamically improve their conversion rates and improve user experience. Landing page can also be adjusted dynamically as the experiment results change to further enhance user experience.\n\n=== Experimentation-based ===\nExperimentation-based LPO can be achieved using A/B testing, multivariate LPO, and total-experience testing. These methodologies are applicable to both closed- and open-ended experimentation. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gafni|first=Ruti|last2=Dvir|first2=Nim|date=2018|title=How Content Volume on Landing Pages Influences Consumer Behavior: Empirical Evidence|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 InSITE Conference|language=en|publisher=Informing Science Institute|volume=|pages=|doi=10.28945/4016|arxiv=1806.00923}}</ref>\n\n==== A/B testing ====\n[[A/B testing]], or ''A/B split testing'', is a method for testing two versions of a webpage: version \"A\" and version \"B\". The goal is to test multiple versions of webpages (e.g., home page vs. product page) or one specific element that changes between variation A and variation B (such as having a lead form on the left hand side or having it placed on the right hand side), [[FAQ]] to determine which version is most appealing/effective. This testing method may also be known as ''A/B/n split testing''; the ''n'' denoting more than 2 tests being measured and compared. The data for A/B testing is usually measured via [[click-through rate]] or an alternative [[conversion tracking]] method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide|title=Conversion Tracking in AdWords: Complete Guide [PPC U] {{!}} WordStream|website=www.wordstream.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref>\n\nTesting can be conducted sequentially or in parallel. In sequential testing, often the easiest to implement, the various versions of the webpages are made available online for a specified time period. In parallel (split) testing, both versions are made available, and the traffic is divided between the two. The results of sequential split testing can be skewed by differing time periods and traffic patterns in which the different tests are run.\n\nA/B testing has the following advantages:\n* Inexpensive because existing resources and tools are used.\n* Simple because no complex statistical analysis is required.\n\nA/B testing has the following disadvantages:\n* Difficult to control all external factors (e.g., [[advertising campaign|campaigns]], search traffic, [[press releases]], [[seasonality]]) when using sequential testing.\n* Very limited in that reliable conclusions cannot be drawn for pages that contain multiple elements that vary in each version.\n\n==== Multivariate testing ====\n[[Multivariate landing page optimization]] (MVLPO) accounts for multiple variations of visual elements (e.g., graphics, text) on a page. For example, a given page may have ''k'' choices for the title, ''m'' choices for the featured image or graphic, and ''n'' choices for the company logo. This example yields ''k\u00d7m\u00d7n'' landing page configurations. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nSignificant improvements can be seen through testing different copy text, form layouts, landing page images and background colours. However, not all elements produce the same improvements in conversions, and by looking at the results from different tests, it is possible to identify the elements that consistently tend to produce the greatest increase in conversions. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe first application of an experimental design for MVLPO was performed by Moskowitz Jacobs Inc. in 1998 as a simulation/demonstration project for [[Lego]]. MVLPO did not become a mainstream approach until 2003 or 2004. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMVLPO has the following advantages:\n* Provides a reliable, scientifically based approach for understanding customers' preferences and optimizing their experience.\n* Has evolved to be an easy-to-use approach in which not much [[Information technology|IT]] involvement is required. In many cases, a few lines of [[JavaScript]] allow remote vendor servers to control changes, collect data, and analyze the results.\n* Provides a  foundation for open-ended experimentation.\n\nMVLPO has the following disadvantages:\n* As with any quantitative consumer research, there is a danger of [[GIGO]] (garbage in, garbage out). Ideas that are sourced from known customer [[touchpoint]]s or strategic business objectives are needed to obtain optimal results.\n* Focuses on optimizing one page at a time. Website experiences for most sites involve multiple pages, which are typically complex. For an [[e-commerce]] website, it is typical for a successful purchase to involve between twelve and eighteen pages; for a support site, even more pages are often required. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== Total-experience testing ====\nTotal-experience testing, or ''experience testing'', is a type of experiment-based testing in which the entire website experience of the visitor is examined using technical capabilities of the website platform (e.g., [[Art Technology Group|ATG]], [[Blue Martini Software]], etc.). Rather than creating multiple websites, total-experience testing uses the website platform to create several persistent experiences, and monitors which one is preferred by the customers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAn advantage of total-experience testing is that it reflects the customer's total website experience, not just the experience with a single page. Two disadvantages are that total-experience testing requires a website platform that supports experience testing, and it takes longer to obtain results than A/B testing and MVLPO. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== \u201cF-like\u201d layout ====\nVarious eye tracking tools have proven that people scan webpages in various patterns, but one of the most common for both desktop and mobile being the letter F shape. This means that most of website visitors see the top and left side of the screen in the first place and only then they move to other parts of the screen line by line. As the result, [[Web developer|web developers]] are including the most important website content into first lines and first words of the website text to improve visitors understanding of overall content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spixel.agency/blog/best-website-design|title=Best website design, 8 tips to keep in mind|last=|first=|date=2019-07-17|website=Spixel Agency|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Message matching ====\nMessage Matching is the idea of matching the pre-click message to the post-click message on the landing page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business.monash.edu/marketing/marketing-dictionary/m/message-match|title=Message Match - Monash Business School|website=business.monash.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}</ref> The goal of message matching is to create a landing page that directs individuals to a page on a product or subject they are expecting.\n\nThis could be done by displaying a statement to the visitors utilizing the same keywords and the right images on the landing page that was found in the advertisement they clicked on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://instapage.com/blog/advertising-agency-accelerated-growth-with-landing-pages|title=How Message Matching and Landing Pages Build Successful Advertising Agencies|date=2016-04-25|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe messaging on the page reinforces the reason for their click, reducing or removing confusion and therefore increasing conversion rates. This improves overall user experience and reduces the [[bounce rate]] (individuals leaving the site without converting or navigating to another portion of the site) for the page. Good message matching can increase conversion by up to 50% in many cases.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Design matching ====\nDesign Matching takes the design on the display ad and repeats it on the landing page. Ensuring the look, feel and sentiment is the same in order to smooth the transition between clicking the ad and completing a conversion.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Conversion path]]\n*[[Home page]]\n*[[Splash screen]]\n*[[Landing page optimization]]\n*[[Multivariate testing in marketing]]\n*[[Multivariate landing page optimization]]\n*[[Online marketing]]\n*[[Pay per click]]\n*[[Search engine marketing]]\n*[[Social media optimization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{SearchEngineOptimization}}\n{{Blog topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Online advertising methods]]\n[[Category:Compensation methods]]\n", "text_old": "In [[Internet marketing|online marketing]], a '''landing page''', sometimes known as a \"'''lead capture page'''\", \"'''static page'''\", or a \"'''destination page'''\", is a single [[web page]] that appears in response to clicking on a [[search engine optimization|search engine optimized]] search result, marketing promotion, [[Email marketing|marketing email]], or an [[Ad serving|online advertisement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.znetlive.com/blog/search-engine-optimization-seo-terminology/|title=Search Engine Optimization Terminology|last=|first=|date=2016-07-15|website=|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}</ref> The landing page will usually display directed sales copy that is a logical extension of the advertisement, search result or link.

The rise of [[cloud computing]] and [[e-commerce]] around 2009 provided ideal conditions for these startups to flourish.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since then the customer requirements changed, requesting integrations with other solutions such as [[email marketing]], lead nurturing and [[customer relationship management]] systems.\n\n===Typical format===\nLanding pages often contain clear, concise action-oriented headlines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/best-selling-headline-david-ogilvys-copywriting-career-7-others/|title=The Best Selling Headline Of David Ogilvy's Copywriting Career (and 7 others!) - Word-of-Mouth and Referral Marketing Blog|website=www.referralcandy.com|publisher=Visakan Veerasamy blog editor at ReferralCandy|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-31|date=2014-06-04}}</ref> A good landing page explains the product offer in a clear manner and places visual emphasis on the value of the product or service presented.\n\nMarketing experts recommend websites remove the navigation menu and limit internal and external links on the page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thefinancialbrand.com/63081/website-conversions-landing-pages/|title=Increase Conversions By Maximizing Your Website Landing Pages|date=2017-01-05|work=The Financial Brand|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref> Any signup forms on the landing page should reflect the value of the offer. For example, a free offer or newsletter sign up form may only request an email address, whereas high value offers may have longer forms with more details required. They may also include a relevant image, animation or short video. These pages also tend to contain small icons (i.e. of [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]]) to facilitate [[social media]] sharing.\n\n==Landing page optimization==\n''Landing page optimization'' (LPO) is one part of a broader [[Internet marketing]] process called [[conversion optimization]], or conversion rate optimization (CRO), with the goal of improving the percentage of visitors to the website that become sales leads and customers. A landing page is a webpage that is displayed when a potential customer clicks an [[advertisement]] or a [[search engine]] result link. This webpage typically displays content that is a relevant extension of the advertisement or link. LPO aims to provide page content and appearance that makes the webpage more appealing to target audiences.\n\nThere are three major types of LPO based on [[targeting (advertising)|targeting]]:<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1108/07363760910965882|title=Integrating science into web design: Consumer\u2010driven web site optimization|year=2009|last1=Gofman|first1=Alex|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Howard R.|last3=Mets|first3=T\u00f5nis|journal=Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume=26|issue=4|pages=286\u2013298}}.</ref>\n# '''Associative content targeting''' (also called ''rule-based optimization'' or ''passive targeting''). The page content is modified based on information obtained about the visitor's search criteria, geographic information of source traffic, or other known generic parameters that can be used for explicit non-research-based consumer [[market segmentation|segmentation]].\n# '''Predictive content targeting''' (also called ''active targeting''). The page content is adjusted by correlating any known information about the visitor (e.g., prior purchase behavior, personal demographic information, browsing patterns, etc.) to anticipate (desired) future actions based on [[predictive analytics]].\n# '''Consumer directed targeting''' (also called ''social targeting''). The page content is created using the relevance of publicly available information through a mechanism based on reviews, ratings, [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], referrals, etc.\n\nThere are two major types of LPO based on experimentation:\n# '''Closed-ended experimentation'''. Consumers are exposed to several variations of landing pages, altering elements like headlines, formatting and layout while their behavior is observed in an attempt to remove distractions that will take the lead away from the page, including the primary navigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.teknicks.com/make-your-landing-pages-convert-faster-than-a-cheetah-on-steroids#.U-T5tmOO2So|title=How To Create Landing Pages That Will Increase Your Conversion Rate|first=Matthew|last=Campion|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> At the conclusion of the experiment, an optimal page is selected based on the outcome of the experiment.\n# '''Open-ended experimentation'''. This approach is similar to closed-ended experimentation except that more variations will be added for testing and experimentation will not stop when a winner is found. This method is used by large corporation to dynamically improve their conversion rates and improve user experience. Landing page can also be adjusted dynamically as the experiment results change to further enhance user experience.\n\n=== Experimentation-based ===\nExperimentation-based LPO can be achieved using A/B testing, multivariate LPO, and total-experience testing. These methodologies are applicable to both closed- and open-ended experimentation. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gafni|first=Ruti|last2=Dvir|first2=Nim|date=2018|title=How Content Volume on Landing Pages Influences Consumer Behavior: Empirical Evidence|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 InSITE Conference|language=en|publisher=Informing Science Institute|volume=|pages=|doi=10.28945/4016|arxiv=1806.00923}}</ref>\n\n==== A/B testing ====\n[[A/B testing]], or ''A/B split testing'', is a method for testing two versions of a webpage: version \"A\" and version \"B\". The goal is to test multiple versions of webpages (e.g., home page vs. product page) or one specific element that changes between variation A and variation B (such as having a lead form on the left hand side or having it placed on the right hand side), [[FAQ]] to determine which version is most appealing/effective. This testing method may also be known as ''A/B/n split testing''; the ''n'' denoting more than 2 tests being measured and compared. The data for A/B testing is usually measured via [[click-through rate]] or an alternative [[conversion tracking]] method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2013/08/13/adwords-conversion-tracking-guide|title=Conversion Tracking in AdWords: Complete Guide [PPC U] {{!}} WordStream|website=www.wordstream.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref>\n\nTesting can be conducted sequentially or in parallel. In sequential testing, often the easiest to implement, the various versions of the webpages are made available online for a specified time period. In parallel (split) testing, both versions are made available, and the traffic is divided between the two. The results of sequential split testing can be skewed by differing time periods and traffic patterns in which the different tests are run.\n\nA/B testing has the following advantages:\n* Inexpensive because existing resources and tools are used.\n* Simple because no complex statistical analysis is required.\n\nA/B testing has the following disadvantages:\n* Difficult to control all external factors (e.g., [[advertising campaign|campaigns]], search traffic, [[press releases]], [[seasonality]]) when using sequential testing.\n* Very limited in that reliable conclusions cannot be drawn for pages that contain multiple elements that vary in each version.\n\n==== Multivariate testing ====\n[[Multivariate landing page optimization]] (MVLPO) accounts for multiple variations of visual elements (e.g., graphics, text) on a page. For example, a given page may have ''k'' choices for the title, ''m'' choices for the featured image or graphic, and ''n'' choices for the company logo. This example yields ''k\u00d7m\u00d7n'' landing page configurations. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nSignificant improvements can be seen through testing different copy text, form layouts, landing page images and background colours. However, not all elements produce the same improvements in conversions, and by looking at the results from different tests, it is possible to identify the elements that consistently tend to produce the greatest increase in conversions. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe first application of an experimental design for MVLPO was performed by Moskowitz Jacobs Inc. in 1998 as a simulation/demonstration project for [[Lego]]. MVLPO did not become a mainstream approach until 2003 or 2004. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMVLPO has the following advantages:\n* Provides a reliable, scientifically based approach for understanding customers' preferences and optimizing their experience.\n* Has evolved to be an easy-to-use approach in which not much [[Information technology|IT]] involvement is required. In many cases, a few lines of [[JavaScript]] allow remote vendor servers to control changes, collect data, and analyze the results.\n* Provides a  foundation for open-ended experimentation.\n\nMVLPO has the following disadvantages:\n* As with any quantitative consumer research, there is a danger of [[GIGO]] (garbage in, garbage out). Ideas that are sourced from known customer [[touchpoint]]s or strategic business objectives are needed to obtain optimal results.\n* Focuses on optimizing one page at a time. Website experiences for most sites involve multiple pages, which are typically complex. For an [[e-commerce]] website, it is typical for a successful purchase to involve between twelve and eighteen pages; for a support site, even more pages are often required. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== Total-experience testing ====\nTotal-experience testing, or ''experience testing'', is a type of experiment-based testing in which the entire website experience of the visitor is examined using technical capabilities of the website platform (e.g., [[Art Technology Group|ATG]], [[Blue Martini Software]], etc.). Rather than creating multiple websites, total-experience testing uses the website platform to create several persistent experiences, and monitors which one is preferred by the customers. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAn advantage of total-experience testing is that it reflects the customer's total website experience, not just the experience with a single page. Two disadvantages are that total-experience testing requires a website platform that supports experience testing, and it takes longer to obtain results than A/B testing and MVLPO. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== \u201cF-like\u201d layout ====\nVarious eye tracking tools have proven that people scan webpages in various patterns, but one of the most common for both desktop and mobile being the letter F shape. This means that most of website visitors see the top and left side of the screen in the first place and only then they move to other parts of the screen line by line. As the result, [[Web developer|web developers]] are including the most important website content into first lines and first words of the website text to improve visitors understanding of overall content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spixel.agency/blog/best-website-design|title=Best website design, 8 tips to keep in mind|last=|first=|date=2019-07-17|website=Spixel Agency|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Message matching ====\nMessage Matching is the idea of matching the pre-click message to the post-click message on the landing page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://business.monash.edu/marketing/marketing-dictionary/m/message-match|title=Message Match - Monash Business School|website=business.monash.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-28}}</ref> The goal of message matching is to create a landing page that directs individuals to a page on a product or subject they are expecting.\n\nThis could be done by displaying a statement to the visitors utilizing the same keywords and the right images on the landing page that was found in the advertisement they clicked on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://instapage.com/blog/advertising-agency-accelerated-growth-with-landing-pages|title=How Message Matching and Landing Pages Build Successful Advertising Agencies|date=2016-04-25|access-date=2017-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe messaging on the page reinforces the reason for their click, reducing or removing confusion and therefore increasing conversion rates. This improves overall user experience and reduces the [[bounce rate]] (individuals leaving the site without converting or navigating to another portion of the site) for the page. Good message matching can increase conversion by up to 50% in many cases.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Design matching ====\nDesign Matching takes the design on the display ad and repeats it on the landing page. Ensuring the look, feel and sentiment is the same in order to smooth the transition between clicking the ad and completing a conversion.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Conversion path]]\n*[[Home page]]\n*[[Splash screen]]\n*[[Landing page optimization]]\n*[[Multivariate testing in marketing]]\n*[[Multivariate landing page optimization]]\n*[[Online marketing]]\n*[[Pay per click]]\n*[[Search engine marketing]]\n*[[Social media optimization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{SearchEngineOptimization}}\n{{Blog topics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Online advertising]]\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n[[Category:Online advertising methods]]\n[[Category:Compensation methods]]\n", "name_user": "2605:a000:1331:23:8ba:4d30:842:9ed4", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page"}

The successful defence of the [[mission (station)|mission station]] of Rorke's Drift, under the command of Lieutenants [[John Chard]] of the [[Royal Engineers]] and [[Gonville Bromhead]], began when a large contingent of [[Impi|Zulu warriors]] broke off from their main force during the final hour of the British defeat at the day-long [[Battle of Isandlwana]] on 22 January 1879, diverting {{convert|6|miles}} to attack Rorke's Drift later that day and continuing into the following day.\n\nJust over 150 British and colonial troops defended the station against attacks by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. The massive but [[wikt:piecemeal#English|piecemeal]] attacks by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison, but were consistently repelled.<ref>Knight 2003, p. 37.</ref> Eleven [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded to the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.\n\n==Prelude==\nRorke's Drift, known as ''kwaJimu''<ref>Morris, p. 168.</ref> (\"Jim's Land\") in the [[Zulu language]], was a [[mission (station)|mission station]] and the former [[trading post]] of James Rorke, an Irish merchant. It was located near a drift, or [[ford (crossing)|ford]], on the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo]] (Mzinyathi) River, which at the time formed the border between the British colony of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. On 9 January 1879, the British No. 3 (Centre) Column, under [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], arrived and encamped at the drift.\n\nOn 11 January, the day after the British [[Anglo-Zulu War#The terms of the ultimatum|ultimatum]] to the Zulus expired, the column crossed the river and encamped on the Zulu bank. A small force consisting of B Company, 2nd Battalion, [[South Wales Borderers|24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot]] (2nd/24th) under Lieutenant [[Gonville Bromhead]] was detailed to garrison the post, which had been turned into a supply depot and hospital under the overall command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet Major]] Henry Spalding, [[104th Foot]], a member of Chelmsford's staff.\n\nOn 20 January, after reconnaissance patrolling and building of a track for its wagons, Chelmsford's column marched to [[Isandlwana]], approximately {{convert|6|miles}} to the east, leaving behind the small garrison. A large company of the 2nd/3rd [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC) under Captain William Stevenson was ordered to remain at the post to strengthen the garrison.<ref>Knight 1996, p.23, \"The post was guarded by one company of 2/24&nbsp;... and a company of the NNC&nbsp;...\".</ref> This company numbered between 100 and 350 men.<ref>Estimates vary: Thompson 2006, p. 65, gives 100.

''Redcoats and Zulus'', 2004, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCaptain Thomas Rainforth's G Company of the 1st/24th Foot was ordered to move up from its station at Helpmekaar, {{convert|10|miles}} to the southeast, after its own relief arrived, to further reinforce the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talana.co.za/html/map.html |title=Map |publisher=Talana.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317184009/http://www.talana.co.za/html/map.html |archivedate=17 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> Later that evening a portion of the No. 2 Column under Brevet Colonel [[Anthony Durnford]], late of the [[Royal Engineers]], arrived at the drift and camped on the Zulu bank, where it remained through the next day.\n\n[[File:Military Map of Zulu Land.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|British Army \"Military Map of Zulu Land\", 1879. Rorke's Drift is at the convergence of the red, green and blue border lines, Islandlwana is slightly to the right]]\nLate on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, [[Royal Engineers]], commanded by Lieutenant [[John Rouse Merriott Chard|John Chard]], which had arrived on the 19th to repair the [[Pontoon bridge|pontoons]] that bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke's Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford's column ''en route'' in the opposite direction.\n\nSometime around noon on the 22nd, Major Spalding left the station for Helpmekaar to ascertain the whereabouts of Rainforth's G Company, which was now overdue. He left Chard in temporary command. Chard rode down to the drift itself where the engineers' camp was located. Soon thereafter, two survivors from Isandlwana \u2013 Lieutenant [[Gert Adendorff]] of the 1st/3rd NNC and a trooper from the [[Natal Carbineers]] \u2013 arrived bearing the news of the defeat and that a part of the Zulu [[impi]] was approaching the station.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Chard, Bromhead, and another of the station's officers, Acting Assistant Commissary [[James Langley Dalton|James Dalton]] (of the [[Commissariat and Transport Department]]), held a quick meeting to decide the best course of action \u2013 whether to attempt a retreat to Helpmekaar or to defend their current position. Dalton pointed out that a small column, travelling in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital patients, would be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior Zulu force, and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight.<ref>Knight 1996, p. 25.</ref>\n\n=== Defensive preparations ===\nOnce the British officers decided to stay, Chard and Bromhead directed their men to make preparations to defend the station. With the garrison's some 400 men<ref>Knight 1996, p. 28, \"With 400 men to build them&nbsp;...\"</ref> working quickly, a defensive perimeter was constructed out of [[mealie]] bags. This perimeter incorporated the storehouse, the hospital, and a stout stone [[kraal]]. The buildings were fortified, with [[loophole]]s (firing holes) knocked through the external walls and the external doors barricaded with furniture.\n\nAt about 3:30 pm, a mixed troop of about 100 [[Natal Native Contingent#Natal Native Horse|Natal Native Horse]] (NNH) under Lieutenant Alfred Henderson arrived at the station after having retreated in good order from Isandlwana. They volunteered to picket the far side of the [[Oscarberg]] (''Shiyane''), the large hill that overlooked the station and from behind which the Zulus were expected to approach.<ref>Knight 1996, p.36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|thumb|upright|Prince [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\nWith the defences nearing completion and battle approaching, Chard had several hundred men available to him: Bromhead's B Company, Stevenson's large NNC company, Henderson's NNH troop, and various others (most of them hospital patients, but 'walking wounded') drawn from various British and colonial units. Adendorff also stayed, while the trooper who had ridden in with him galloped on to warn the garrison at Helpmekaar.<ref name=\"autogenerated401\">Morris 1998, p. 401</ref>\n\nThe force was sufficient, in Chard's estimation, to fend off the Zulus. Chard posted the British soldiers around the perimeter, adding some of the more able patients, the 'casuals' and civilians, and those of the NNC who possessed firearms along the barricade. The rest of the NNC, armed only with spears, were posted outside the mealie bag and biscuit box barricade within the stone-walled cattle kraal.<ref name=\"autogenerated401\"/>\n\nThe approaching Zulu force was vastly larger; the [[uDloko]], [[uThulwana]], [[inDlondo]] ''amabutho'' (regiments) of married men aged in their 30s and 40s and the [[inDlu-yengwe]] ''ibutho'' of young unmarried men mustered 3,000 to 4,000 warriors, none of them engaged during the battle at Isandlwana.<ref>Morris 1998, p. 370, \"played no part in the battle\"</ref> This Zulu force was the 'loins' or reserve of the army at Isandlwana and is often referred to as the [[Undi Corps]]. It was directed to swing wide of the British left flank and pass west and south of Isandlwana hill itself, in order to position itself across the [[line of communication]] and retreat of the British and their colonial allies in order to prevent their escape back into Natal by way of the Buffalo River ford leading to Rorke's Drift.\n\nBy the time the Undi Corps reached Rorke's Drift at 4:30 pm, they had fast-marched some {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the morning encampment they had left at around 8 am, and they would spend almost the next eleven and a half hours continuously storming the British fortifications at Rorke's Drift.\n\nMost Zulu warriors were armed with an ''[[assegai]]'' (short spear) and a shield made of cowhide.<ref>Archer, Christon I.

Prince Dabulamanzi was considered rash and aggressive, and this characterisation was borne out by his violation of King Cetshwayo's order to act only in defence of Zululand against the invading British soldiers and not carry the war over the border into enemy territory.<ref>Knight 2003, p. 33.</ref> The Rorke's Drift attack was an unplanned raid rather than any organised counter-invasion, with many of the Undi Corps Zulus breaking off to raid other African kraals and homesteads while the main body advanced on Rorke's Drift.\n\nAt about 4:00 pm, [[James Henry Reynolds|Surgeon James Reynolds]], Otto Witt \u2013 the Swedish [[missionary]] who ran the mission at Rorke's Drift \u2013 and army chaplain [[George Smith (chaplain)|Reverend George Smith]] came down from the Oscarberg hillside with the news that a body of Zulus was fording the river to the southeast and was \"no more than five minutes away\". At this point, Witt decided to depart the station, as his family lived in an isolated farmhouse about {{convert|30|km|mi}} away, and he wanted to be with them. Witt's native servant, Umkwelnantaba, left with him; so too did one of the hospital patients, Lieutenant Thomas Purvis of the 1st/3rd NNC.\n\n==Battle==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2010}}\n[[File:Rorke's.Drift.Post.jpg|thumb|Contemporary drawing of Rorke's Drift Post, from ''The History of the Corps of Royal Engineers''.<ref name=Porter31/>]]\nAt about 4:20 pm, the battle began with Lieutenant Henderson's NNH troopers, stationed behind the Oscarberg, briefly engaging the vanguard of the main Zulu force.<ref>Knight 1996, p.36, and on p.88 this is described by Knight as \"the first shots of the battle\".</ref> However, tired from the battle at Isandlwana and retreat to Rorke's Drift as well as being short of carbine ammunition, Henderson's men departed for Helpmekaar. Henderson himself reported to Lieutenant Chard the enemy were close and that \"his men would not obey his orders but were going off to Helpmekaar\".<ref name=\"autogenerated401\"/>\n\nHenderson then followed his departing men. Upon witnessing the withdrawal of Henderson's NNH troop, Captain Stevenson's NNC company abandoned the cattle kraal and fled, greatly reducing the strength of the defending garrison.<ref>Morris, p. 402.

[[Frederick Hitch|Private Frederick Hitch]], posted as lookout atop the storehouse, reported a large column of Zulus approaching. The Zulu vanguard, 600 men of the iNdluyengwe, attacked the south wall, which joined the hospital and the storehouse. The British opened fire when the Zulus were {{convert|500|yd}} away.\n\n[[File:Lady butler defense rorkes drift.jpg|thumb|''[[The Defence of Rorke's Drift]]'' by [[Elizabeth Thompson|Lady Butler]] (1880).{{efn|Lieutenants [[John Chard]] and [[Gonville Bromhead]] (centre) commanding, behind them Padre [[George Smith (chaplain)|George Smith]] hands out ammunition, Private [[Frederick Hitch]] (right, standing) handing out ammunition while wounded; Surgeon [[James Henry Reynolds]] and Storekeeper Byrne tending to the wounded Corporal Scammell (Reynolds kneeling; Byrne falling, shot). Possibly Corporal [[Ferdinand Schiess]] at centre background at the barricade, left of Chard and Bromhead, face not shown.}}]]\nThe majority of the attacking Zulu force swept around to attack the north wall, while a few took cover and were either pinned down by continuing British fire or retreated to the terraces of Oscarberg. There they began a harassing fire of their own. As this occurred, another Zulu force swept on to the hospital and northwestern wall.\n\nThose British on the barricades \u2014 including Dalton and Bromhead \u2014 were soon engaged in fierce [[hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand fighting]]. The British wall was too high for the Zulus to scale, so they resorted to crouching under the wall, trying to get hold of the defenders' [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifles, slashing at British soldiers with [[assegai]]s or firing their weapons through the wall. At places, they clambered over each other's bodies to drive the British off the walls but were driven back.\n\nZulu fire, both from those under the wall and around the Oscarberg, inflicted a few casualties, and five of the seventeen defenders who were killed or mortally wounded in the action were struck while at the north wall.\n\n=== Defence of the hospital ===\nChard realised that the north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, he pulled his men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles poking out were grabbed at by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal [[William Wilson Allen]] and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, [[John Williams (VC)|John Williams]], Joseph Williams, [[Alfred Henry Hook]], [[Robert Jones (VC)|Robert Jones]], and [[William Jones (VC)|William Jones]].\n\nPrivates Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams and other patients tried to hold the hospital entrance with rifles and fixed bayonets. Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath that window. As it became clear the front of the building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room in the back of the hospital. As he made a passable breach, the door into the central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he only had time to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way.\n\nThe corner room that John Williams had pulled the two patients into was occupied by Private Hook and another nine patients. John Williams hacked at the wall to the next room with his pick-axe, as Hook held off the Zulus. A firefight erupted as the Zulus fired through the door and Hook returned fire \u2013 but not without an assegai striking his helmet and stunning him.<ref>Private Henry Hook's account in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' 1905.</ref>\n\nWilliams made the hole big enough to get into the next room, which was occupied only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived through the hole. John Williams once again went to work, spurred on by the fact that the roof was now ablaze, as Hook defended the hole and Waters continued to fire through a loophole.\n\nAfter fifty minutes, the hole was large enough to drag the patients through, and the men\u2013 save Privates Waters and Beckett, who hid in the wardrobe (Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds)\u2013 were now in the last room, being defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones. From here, the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way across the yard to the barricade.\n\nOf the eleven patients, nine survived the trip to the barricade, as did all the able-bodied men. According to [[James Henry Reynolds]], only four defenders were killed in the hospital: one was a member of the Natal Native Contingent with a broken leg; Sergeant Maxfield and Private Jenkins, who were ill with fever and refused to be moved were also killed. Reportedly, Jenkins was killed after being seized and stabbed, together with Private Adams who also refused to move. Private Cole, assigned to the hospital, was killed when he ran outside. Another hospital patient killed was Trooper Hunter of the Natal Mounted Police.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=M.J.|title=Leaders and Battles: The Art of Military Leadership|year=2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=138|isbn=9780307537034|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GCkXtLTgs6UC&pg=PT202&lpg=PT202&dq=%22Trooper+Hunter%22+%22Natal+Mounted+Police%22#v=onepage}}</ref> Among the hospital patients who escaped were a Corporal Mayer of the NNC; Bombardier Lewis of the Royal Artillery, and Trooper Green of the Natal Mounted Police, who was wounded in the thigh by a spent bullet.

As night fell, the Zulu attacks grew stronger. The cattle kraal came under renewed assault and was evacuated by 10:00 pm, leaving the remaining men in a small bastion around the storehouse. Throughout the night, the Zulus kept up a constant assault against the British positions; Zulu attacks only began to slacken after midnight, and they finally ended by 2:00 am, being replaced by a constant harassing fire from Zulu firearms until 4:00 am.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nBy that time, the garrison had suffered fourteen dead. Two others were mortally wounded and eight more \u2013 including Dalton \u2013 were seriously wounded. Almost every man had some kind of wound. They were all exhausted, having fought for the better part of ten hours and were running low on ammunition. Of 20,000 rounds in reserve at the mission, only 900 remained.<ref>Machanik, Major (Dr) Felix.

The massive but [[wikt:piecemeal#English|piecemeal]] attacks by the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison, but were consistently repelled.<ref>Knight 2003, p. 37.</ref> Eleven [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded to the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.\n\n==Prelude==\nRorke's Drift, known as ''kwaJimu''<ref>Morris, p. 168.</ref> (\"Jim's Land\") in the [[Zulu language]], was a [[mission (station)|mission station]] and the former [[trading post]] of James Rorke, an Irish merchant. It was located near a drift, or [[ford (crossing)|ford]], on the [[Buffalo River (KwaZulu-Natal)|Buffalo]] (Mzinyathi) River, which at the time formed the border between the British colony of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and the [[Zulu Kingdom]]. On 9 January 1879, the British No. 3 (Centre) Column, under [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], arrived and encamped at the drift.\n\nOn 11 January, the day after the British [[Anglo-Zulu War#The terms of the ultimatum|ultimatum]] to the Zulus expired, the column crossed the river and encamped on the Zulu bank. A small force consisting of B Company, 2nd Battalion, [[South Wales Borderers|24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot]] (2nd/24th) under Lieutenant [[Gonville Bromhead]] was detailed to garrison the post, which had been turned into a supply depot and hospital under the overall command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet Major]] Henry Spalding, [[104th Foot]], a member of Chelmsford's staff.\n\nOn 20 January, after reconnaissance patrolling and building of a track for its wagons, Chelmsford's column marched to [[Isandlwana]], approximately {{convert|6|miles}} to the east, leaving behind the small garrison.

Rorke's Drift is at the convergence of the red, green and blue border lines, Islandlwana is slightly to the right]]\nLate on the evening of 21 January, Durnford was ordered to Isandlwana, as was a small detachment of No. 5 Field Company, [[Royal Engineers]], commanded by Lieutenant [[John Rouse Merriott Chard|John Chard]], which had arrived on the 19th to repair the [[Pontoon bridge|pontoons]] that bridged the Buffalo. Chard rode ahead of his detachment to Isandlwana on the morning of 22 January to clarify his orders, but was sent back to Rorke's Drift with only his wagon and its driver to construct defensive positions for the expected reinforcement company, passing Durnford's column ''en route'' in the opposite direction.\n\nSometime around noon on the 22nd, Major Spalding left the station for Helpmekaar to ascertain the whereabouts of Rainforth's G Company, which was now overdue. He left Chard in temporary command. Chard rode down to the drift itself where the engineers' camp was located. Soon thereafter, two survivors from Isandlwana \u2013 Lieutenant [[Gert Adendorff]] of the 1st/3rd NNC and a trooper from the [[Natal Carbineers]] \u2013 arrived bearing the news of the defeat and that a part of the Zulu [[impi]] was approaching the station.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Chard, Bromhead, and another of the station's officers, Acting Assistant Commissary [[James Langley Dalton|James Dalton]] (of the [[Commissariat and Transport Department]]), held a quick meeting to decide the best course of action \u2013 whether to attempt a retreat to Helpmekaar or to defend their current position. Dalton pointed out that a small column, travelling in open country and burdened with carts full of hospital patients, would be easily overtaken and defeated by a numerically superior Zulu force, and so it was soon agreed that the only acceptable course was to remain and fight.<ref>Knight 1996, p. 25.</ref>\n\n=== Defensive preparations ===\nOnce the British officers decided to stay, Chard and Bromhead directed their men to make preparations to defend the station. With the garrison's some 400 men<ref>Knight 1996, p. 28, \"With 400 men to build them&nbsp;...\"</ref> working quickly, a defensive perimeter was constructed out of [[mealie]] bags. This perimeter incorporated the storehouse, the hospital, and a stout stone [[kraal]]. The buildings were fortified, with [[loophole]]s (firing holes) knocked through the external walls and the external doors barricaded with furniture.\n\nAt about 3:30 pm, a mixed troop of about 100 [[Natal Native Contingent#Natal Native Horse|Natal Native Horse]] (NNH) under Lieutenant Alfred Henderson arrived at the station after having retreated in good order from Isandlwana. They volunteered to picket the far side of the [[Oscarberg]] (''Shiyane''), the large hill that overlooked the station and from behind which the Zulus were expected to approach.<ref>Knight 1996, p.36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|thumb|upright|Prince [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\nWith the defences nearing completion and battle approaching, Chard had several hundred men available to him: Bromhead's B Company, Stevenson's large NNC company, Henderson's NNH troop, and various others (most of them hospital patients, but 'walking wounded') drawn from various British and colonial units. Adendorff also stayed, while the trooper who had ridden in with him galloped on to warn the garrison at Helpmekaar.<ref name=\"autogenerated401\">Morris 1998, p. 401</ref>\n\nThe force was sufficient, in Chard's estimation, to fend off the Zulus. Chard posted the British soldiers around the perimeter, adding some of the more able patients, the 'casuals' and civilians, and those of the NNC who possessed firearms along the barricade. The rest of the NNC, armed only with spears, were posted outside the mealie bag and biscuit box barricade within the stone-walled cattle kraal.<ref name=\"autogenerated401\"/>\n\nThe approaching Zulu force was vastly larger; the [[uDloko]], [[uThulwana]], [[inDlondo]] ''amabutho'' (regiments) of married men aged in their 30s and 40s and the [[inDlu-yengwe]] ''ibutho'' of young unmarried men mustered 3,000 to 4,000 warriors, none of them engaged during the battle at Isandlwana.<ref>Morris 1998, p. 370, \"played no part in the battle\"</ref> This Zulu force was the 'loins' or reserve of the army at Isandlwana and is often referred to as the [[Undi Corps]]. It was directed to swing wide of the British left flank and pass west and south of Isandlwana hill itself, in order to position itself across the [[line of communication]] and retreat of the British and their colonial allies in order to prevent their escape back into Natal by way of the Buffalo River ford leading to Rorke's Drift.\n\nBy the time the Undi Corps reached Rorke's Drift at 4:30 pm, they had fast-marched some {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the morning encampment they had left at around 8 am, and they would spend almost the next eleven and a half hours continuously storming the British fortifications at Rorke's Drift.\n\nMost Zulu warriors were armed with an ''[[assegai]]'' (short spear) and a shield made of cowhide.<ref>Archer, Christon I.

Prince Dabulamanzi was considered rash and aggressive, and this characterisation was borne out by his violation of King Cetshwayo's order to act only in defence of Zululand against the invading British soldiers and not carry the war over the border into enemy territory.<ref>Knight 2003, p. 33.</ref> The Rorke's Drift attack was an unplanned raid rather than any organised counter-invasion, with many of the Undi Corps Zulus breaking off to raid other African kraals and homesteads while the main body advanced on Rorke's Drift.\n\nAt about 4:00 pm, [[James Henry Reynolds|Surgeon James Reynolds]], Otto Witt \u2013 the Swedish [[missionary]] who ran the mission at Rorke's Drift \u2013 and army chaplain [[George Smith (chaplain)|Reverend George Smith]] came down from the Oscarberg hillside with the news that a body of Zulus was fording the river to the southeast and was \"no more than five minutes away\". At this point, Witt decided to depart the station, as his family lived in an isolated farmhouse about {{convert|30|km|mi}} away, and he wanted to be with them.

[[Frederick Hitch|Private Frederick Hitch]], posted as lookout atop the storehouse, reported a large column of Zulus approaching. The Zulu vanguard, 600 men of the iNdluyengwe, attacked the south wall, which joined the hospital and the storehouse.

There they began a harassing fire of their own. As this occurred, another Zulu force swept on to the hospital and northwestern wall.\n\nThose British on the barricades \u2014 including Dalton and Bromhead \u2014 were soon engaged in fierce [[hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand fighting]]. The British wall was too high for the Zulus to scale, so they resorted to crouching under the wall, trying to get hold of the defenders' [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifles, slashing at British soldiers with [[assegai]]s or firing their weapons through the wall. At places, they clambered over each other's bodies to drive the British off the walls but were driven back.\n\nZulu fire, both from those under the wall and around the Oscarberg, inflicted a few casualties, and five of the seventeen defenders who were killed or mortally wounded in the action were struck while at the north wall.\n\n=== Defence of the hospital ===\nChard realised that the north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, he pulled his men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles poking out were grabbed at by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal [[William Wilson Allen]] and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, [[John Williams (VC)|John Williams]], Joseph Williams, [[Alfred Henry Hook]], [[Robert Jones (VC)|Robert Jones]], and [[William Jones (VC)|William Jones]].\n\nPrivates Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams and other patients tried to hold the hospital entrance with rifles and fixed bayonets. Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath that window. As it became clear the front of the building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room in the back of the hospital. As he made a passable breach, the door into the central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he only had time to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way.\n\nThe corner room that John Williams had pulled the two patients into was occupied by Private Hook and another nine patients. John Williams hacked at the wall to the next room with his pick-axe, as Hook held off the Zulus. A firefight erupted as the Zulus fired through the door and Hook returned fire \u2013 but not without an assegai striking his helmet and stunning him.<ref>Private Henry Hook's account in ''[[The Royal Magazine]]'' 1905.</ref>\n\nWilliams made the hole big enough to get into the next room, which was occupied only by patient Private Waters, and dragged the patients through. The last man out was Hook, who killed some Zulus who had knocked down the door before he dived through the hole. John Williams once again went to work, spurred on by the fact that the roof was now ablaze, as Hook defended the hole and Waters continued to fire through a loophole.\n\nAfter fifty minutes, the hole was large enough to drag the patients through, and the men\u2013 save Privates Waters and Beckett, who hid in the wardrobe (Waters was wounded and Beckett died of assegai wounds)\u2013 were now in the last room, being defended by Privates Robert Jones and William Jones. From here, the patients clambered out through a window and then made their way across the yard to the barricade.\n\nOf the eleven patients, nine survived the trip to the barricade, as did all the able-bodied men. According to [[James Henry Reynolds]], only four defenders were killed in the hospital: one was a member of the Natal Native Contingent with a broken leg; Sergeant Maxfield and Private Jenkins, who were ill with fever and refused to be moved were also killed. Reportedly, Jenkins was killed after being seized and stabbed, together with Private Adams who also refused to move. Private Cole, assigned to the hospital, was killed when he ran outside. Another hospital patient killed was Trooper Hunter of the Natal Mounted Police.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=M.J.|title=Leaders and Battles: The Art of Military Leadership|year=2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCkXtLTgs6UC&pg=PT202&lpg=PT202&dq=%22Trooper+Hunter%22+%22Natal+Mounted+Police%22&source=bl&ots=chrv4Zb2K-&sig=d4Jx--8yWD_hkTzQBAI1dT6FV2g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9LA-UcX_GIrnrAH_pIHADg&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22Trooper%20Hunter%22%20%20%22Natal%20Mounted%20Police%22&f=false}}</ref> Among the hospital patients who escaped were a Corporal Mayer of the NNC; Bombardier Lewis of the Royal Artillery, and Trooper Green of the Natal Mounted Police, who was wounded in the thigh by a spent bullet.

As night fell, the Zulu attacks grew stronger. The cattle kraal came under renewed assault and was evacuated by 10:00 pm, leaving the remaining men in a small bastion around the storehouse. Throughout the night, the Zulus kept up a constant assault against the British positions; Zulu attacks only began to slacken after midnight, and they finally ended by 2:00 am, being replaced by a constant harassing fire from Zulu firearms until 4:00 am.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nBy that time, the garrison had suffered fourteen dead. Two others were mortally wounded and eight more \u2013 including Dalton \u2013 were seriously wounded. Almost every man had some kind of wound.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14{{nbsp}}weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs until weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves.<ref name=\"laurenson\">{{cite journal |last1 = Laurenson |first1 = M.

Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the [[Wildlife Safari]] ([[Oregon]], United States) died due to a [[peritonitis]] epidemic.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Rare breed: can Laurie Marker help the world's fastest mammal outrun its fate? |last = Gugliotta |first = G. |journal = Smithsonian Magazine |year = 2008 |url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/making-a-difference/rare-breed-20811232/ |pages = 1\u20134 }}</ref>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nCheetahs occur in a variety of habitats; areas with greater availability of prey, good visibility and minimal chances of encountering larger predators are preferred. Compared to other felids, cheetahs appear to be less selective in habitat choice. Cheetahs in eastern and southern Africa occur mostly in [[savanna]]s such as the Kalahari and Serengeti.; the open space is suitable for high-speed runs, and the tall grasses and bush conceal the cheetah as it stalks the prey. The dense vegetation in [[veld]]s and woodlands protects juveniles from predators and reduces the chances of [[kleptoparasitism]]. In central, northern and western Africa cheetahs inhabit arid mountain ranges and valleys; in the harsh climate of Sahara cheetahs prefer high mountains, which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert. The vegetation and water resources in these mountains supports antelopes. Iranian cheetahs occur in hilly terrain of deserts at elevation up to {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, where annual precipitation is generally below {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the primary vegetation in these areas is thinly distributed shrubs, less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Cheetahs seldom occur in [[Tropical forest|tropical]] and [[montane forest]]s, though there have been reports of cheetahs at elevations of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} on [[Mount Kenya]].<ref name=iucn/><ref name=marker8>{{cite book |editor1=Marker, L. |editor2=Boast, L.

Nearly 500 years ago, the cheetah was still common throughout Africa, though it avoided deserts and tropical forests. In [[Eurasia]], Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, and the [[Ganga river|Ganga]] and [[Indus River Valley|Indus]] [[river valley]]s in [[South Asia]] sheltered large numbers of cheetahs.<ref name=wcw/> However, today the cheetah has been exterminated from the majority of its earlier range. The IUCN estimates that the total expanse of the range of the cheetah in earlier times was approximately {{convert|25344648|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}; the range ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}) has since then reduced to {{convert|2709054|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, a substantial decline of 89%.<ref name=iucn/> Unlike other big cats in Africa, the cheetah tends to occur in low densities typically between 0.3 and 3 adults per {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}\u2014these values are 10\u201330% of  those reported for leopards and lions.

These numbers, however, might not give an accurate idea of populations in an area as cheetahs often do not occur uniformly in a region.<ref name=marker8/>\n\n===Africa===\nThe [[African cheetah]] is found mainly in the eastern and southern regions; its presence across the continent has declined to a mere 10% of the historical range. The range in eastern Africa has reduced to 6% of its original extent, so that presently it is distributed in an area of {{convert|310586|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/> In the [[Horn of Africa]], the cheetah occurs in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Marker |first1 = L. |title = Current status of the cheetah (''Acinonyx jubatus'') |journal = Proceedings of a Symposium on Cheetahs as Game Ranch Animals: Onderstepoort, Republic of South Africa |year = 1998 |pages = 1\u201317 |url = http://cheetah.org/site/wp-content/uploads/1998/10/status_of_the_cheetah.pdf }}</ref> The range has not reduced as much in the southern part of the continent, where it occurs in an area of {{convert|1223388|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, 22% of its original range.

They occur in very low numbers in northern and western Africa.\n\nThe distribution of prey may influence habitat preferences; in a study in the Kruger National Park, female cheetahs were found to spend a significant amount of time in woodlands, where impala occurred. It was suggested that though the forested area was unsuitable for hunting, the females preferred woodlands to encounter more impala. Male coalitions, on the other hand, shunned dense habitats and spent most of the time in open savannahs. An explanation given for this was that the coalitions prefer larger prey than impala.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Broomhall |first1 = L. S. |last2 = Mills |first2 = M. G.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

In addition to spitting, the cheetah hits the ground with its front paws.<ref name=Eklund_al2012/>\n* Bleating: Similar to the meow of the domestic cat, the cheetah can bleat, and sometimes moan, when a larger predator deprives it of its prey.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Chirping or stutter-barking: A cheetah chirps when excited (for instance, when gathered around a kill). This vocalisation can also be used at social meetings, during courtship, or in attempting to find another; the chirp of a mother searching for her cubs, which sounds more like the yelp of a dog than the chirp of a bird, can be heard up to {{convert|2|km|mi}} away. A study estimated the chirp's total duration as 0.09 to 0.5 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Churring: The purpose of this sound is similar to that of the chirp. It may resemble a growl. The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr is [[staccato]] and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3\u201315 separate pulses and last 0.1\u20131.3 seconds.<ref name=\"volodina\"/>\n* Mother-cub vocalizations: Apart from chirping, mothers use some other sounds to interact with their cubs. A repeated ''ihn ihn'' is used to gather the cubs, while a ''prr prr'' is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still in the presence of danger.<ref name=Estes/>\n* Whirring: This sound is produced by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Other methods====\n[[File:Two cheetahs together.jpg|thumbnail|left|Cheetahs grooming each other]]\nScent plays a significant role in [[olfactory communication]]. Cheetahs often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then the male will itself urinate there and sniff at its own scent before leaving. Other observing individuals will repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males. Females in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and her excrement can attract males from far off.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/>\n\nSocial meetings are marked by mutual sniffing in oral and genital areas, grooming one another, rubbing the cheeks, and face-licking. Further physical contact has not been observed.<ref name=Estes/>\n\nTear streaks are a means of visual communication. The tear streaks combined with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions when viewed from a close range. The ears and the face are obscured from a distance, and so are the expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n====Display behavior====\nCheetahs engage in several [[Display (zoology)|displays]] during fights, hunting, or self-defense. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah will hold its head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, the ground is hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=\"soc\">{{cite journal |last1=Wielebnowski |first1=N.

In a 1994 study, nearly 77% of litters died before eight weeks of birth, and nearly 83% of those alive could not make it to adolescence (14{{nbsp}}weeks). Lions emerged as the major predator of juveniles, accounting for nearly 78% of the deaths. The study concluded that the survival rate of cubs until weaning was a mere 4.8%. This was attributed to the open terrain of the region, which does not allow cheetahs to conceal themselves.<ref name=\"laurenson\">{{cite journal |last1 = Laurenson |first1 = M.

Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the [[Wildlife Safari]] ([[Oregon]], United States) died due to a [[peritonitis]] epidemic.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Rare breed: can Laurie Marker help the world's fastest mammal outrun its fate? |last = Gugliotta |first = G. |journal = Smithsonian Magazine |year = 2008 |url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/making-a-difference/rare-breed-20811232/ |pages = 1\u20134 }}</ref>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nCheetahs occur in a variety of habitats; areas with greater availability of prey, good visibility and minimal chances of encountering larger predators are preferred. Compared to other felids, cheetahs appear to be less selective in habitat choice. Cheetahs in eastern and southern Africa occur mostly in [[savanna]]s such as the Kalahari and Serengeti.; the open space is suitable for high-speed runs, and the tall grasses and bush conceal the cheetah as it stalks the prey. The dense vegetation in [[veld]]s and woodlands protects juveniles from predators and reduces the chances of [[kleptoparasitism]]. In central, northern and western Africa cheetahs inhabit arid mountain ranges and valleys; in the harsh climate of Sahara cheetahs prefer high mountains, which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert. The vegetation and water resources in these mountains supports antelopes. Iranian cheetahs occur in hilly terrain of deserts at elevation up to {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, where annual precipitation is generally below {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the primary vegetation in these areas is thinly distributed shrubs, less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Cheetahs seldom occur in [[Tropical forest|tropical]] and [[montane forest]]s, though there have been reports of cheetahs at elevations of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} on [[Mount Kenya]].<ref name=iucn/><ref name=marker8>{{cite book |editor1=Marker, L. |editor2=Boast, L.

Nearly 500 years ago, the cheetah was still common throughout Africa, though it avoided deserts and tropical forests. In [[Eurasia]], Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, and the [[Ganga river|Ganga]] and [[Indus River Valley|Indus]] [[river valley]]s in [[South Asia]] sheltered large numbers of cheetahs.<ref name=wcw/> However, today the cheetah has been exterminated from the majority of its earlier range. The IUCN estimates that the total expanse of the range of the cheetah in earlier times was approximately {{convert|25344648|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}; the range ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}) has since then reduced to {{convert|2709054|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, a substantial decline of 89%.<ref name=iucn/> Unlike other big cats in Africa, the cheetah tends to occur in low densities typically between 0.3 and 3 adults per {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}\u2014these values are 10\u201330% of  those reported for leopards and lions.

These numbers, however, might not give an accurate idea of populations in an area as cheetahs often do not occur uniformly in a region.<ref name=marker8/>\n\n===Africa===\nThe [[African cheetah]] is found mainly in the eastern and southern regions; its presence across the continent has declined to a mere 10% of the historical range. The range in eastern Africa has reduced to 6% of its original extent, so that presently it is distributed in an area of {{convert|310586|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/> In the [[Horn of Africa]], the cheetah occurs in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Marker |first1 = L. |title = Current status of the cheetah (''Acinonyx jubatus'') |journal = Proceedings of a Symposium on Cheetahs as Game Ranch Animals: Onderstepoort, Republic of South Africa |year = 1998 |pages = 1\u201317 |url = http://cheetah.org/site/wp-content/uploads/1998/10/status_of_the_cheetah.pdf }}</ref> The range has not reduced as much in the southern part of the continent, where it occurs in an area of {{convert|1223388|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, 22% of its original range.

They occur in very low numbers in northern and western Africa.\n\nThe distribution of prey may influence habitat preferences; in a study in the Kruger National Park, female cheetahs were found to spend a significant amount of time in woodlands, where impala occurred. It was suggested that though the forested area was unsuitable for hunting, the females preferred woodlands to encounter more impala. Male coalitions, on the other hand, shunned dense habitats and spent most of the time in open savannahs. An explanation given for this was that the coalitions prefer larger prey than impala.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Broomhall |first1 = L. S. |last2 = Mills |first2 = M. G.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].
