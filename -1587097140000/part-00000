As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.  She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities.\n \nShe has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.\n\n==Legislative Session 2011\u201312==\nIn the 2011-2012 legislative session, Assemblywoman Ma had 25 bills chaptered into law, 4 Assembly Concurrent Resolutions and 1 Assembly Joint Resolution signed by Governor Brown.\n\nA few of the Assemblywoman's bills are as follows:\n\n'''AB 74 Public event action plans and cooperative management'''<br> \nIn response to substance abuse-related deaths, injuries and arrests involving electronic-music shows at San Francisco's Cow Palace and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues. If the agency concludes there's a strong possibility for loss of life or harm to participants, the show's promoter would be required to prepare a plan to provide an adequate law-enforcement presence, control drug use and potentially prohibit minors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18151243?nclick_check=1 |title=Ma's bill targeting raves passes Assembly - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\n'''AB 183 (2011) Alcoholic beverage licenses: self-service checkout'''<br/>\nThis bill prohibits off-sale licensees from selling alcoholic beverages using a customer-operated checkout stand located on the licensee's physical premises.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.  She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities.\n \nShe has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.\n\n==Legislative Session 2011\u201312==\nIn the 2011-2012 legislative session, Assemblywoman Ma had 25 bills chaptered into law, 4 Assembly Concurrent Resolutions and 1 Assembly Joint Resolution signed by Governor Brown.\n\nA few of the Assemblywoman's bills are as follows:\n\n'''AB 74 Public event action plans and cooperative management'''<br> \nIn response to substance abuse-related deaths, injuries and arrests involving electronic-music shows at San Francisco's Cow Palace and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues. If the agency concludes there's a strong possibility for loss of life or harm to participants, the show's promoter would be required to prepare a plan to provide an adequate law-enforcement presence, control drug use and potentially prohibit minors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18151243?nclick_check=1 |title=Ma's bill targeting raves passes Assembly - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\n'''AB 183 (2011) Alcoholic beverage licenses: self-service checkout'''<br/>\nThis bill prohibits off-sale licensees from selling alcoholic beverages using a customer-operated checkout stand located on the licensee's physical premises.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

A fourth person, Mark Haydon, was convicted for helping to dispose of the bodies. The trial was one of the longest and most publicised in [[Australia]]n legal history.\n\nMost of the bodies were found in [[barrels]] in an abandoned [[bank vault]] in [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown]], hence the names given in the press for the murders. Only one of the victims was killed in Snowtown itself, which is approximately {{convert|140|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Adelaide]], and neither the eleven victims nor the three perpetrators were from the town. Although motivation for the murders is unclear, the killers were led by Bunting to believe that the victims were [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], or \"weak\". In the case of some victims, the murders were preceded by torture, and efforts were made to appropriate victims' identities, [[social security]] payments and bank accounts.\n\nAlthough initially the notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, it created a lasting stigma, with authorities considering a change of the town's name and identity.\n\n==Investigation==\nInitially, the body of Clinton Trezise was found at [[Lower Light, South Australia|Lower Light]] in 1994,<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/> although no connection to Bunting was made at this time. Similarly, the death of Thomas Trevilyan in 1997 was initially treated as a [[suicide]]. It was police inquiries into Elizabeth Haydon's disappearance which eventually led them to Snowtown, and on 20 May 1999, the remains of eight victims were found by the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]] in six plastic barrels in a disused bank vault.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> For this reason, the murders were dubbed the \"bodies in barrels murders\".<ref name=\"haydon trial\"/>\n\nIt is believed that the bodies had been held in several locations in South Australia before being moved to Snowtown in 1999. Prosecutors believe that the killers moved the bodies after they became aware of the ongoing police investigation. Two more bodies were found buried in the backyard of Bunting's house in Adelaide.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> Police later arrested and charged Bunting, Wagner, Vlassakis and Mark Haydon on 21 May 1999 for the murders. At the time of the arrest, Vlassakis lived in Bunting's home.<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/>\n\n==Trials and verdicts==\nThe trial of Bunting and Wagner lasted almost twelve months, the longest in the history of South Australia.

A fourth person, Mark Haydon, was convicted for helping to dispose of the bodies. The trial was one of the longest and most publicised in [[Australia]]n legal history.\n\nMost of the bodies were found in [[barrels]] in an abandoned [[bank vault]] in [[Snowtown, South Australia|Snowtown]], hence the names given in the press for the murders. Only one of the victims was killed in Snowtown itself, which is approximately {{convert|140|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Adelaide]], and neither the eleven victims nor the three perpetrators were from the town. Although motivation for the murders is unclear, the killers were led by Bunting to believe that the victims were [[Pedophilia|paedophiles]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], or \"weak\". In the case of some victims, the murders were preceded by torture, and efforts were made to appropriate victims' identities, [[social security]] payments and bank accounts.\n\nAlthough initially the notoriety of the murders led to a short-term economic boost from tourists visiting Snowtown, it created a lasting stigma, with authorities considering a change of the town's name and identity.\n\n==Investigation==\nInitially, the body of Clinton Trezise was found at [[Lower Light, South Australia|Lower Light]] in 1994,<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/> although no connection to Bunting was made at this time. Similarly, the death of Thomas Trevilyan in 1997 was initially treated as a [[suicide]]. It was police inquiries into Elizabeth Haydon's disappearance which eventually led them to Snowtown, and on 20 May 1999, the remains of eight victims were found by the [[South Australia Police|South Australian Police]] in six plastic barrels in a disused bank vault.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> For this reason, the murders were dubbed the \"bodies in barrels murders\".<ref name=\"haydon trial\"/>\n\nIt is believed that the bodies had been held in several locations in South Australia before being moved to Snowtown in 1999. Prosecutors believe that the killers moved the bodies after they became aware of the ongoing police investigation. Two more bodies were found buried in the backyard of Bunting's house in Adelaide.<ref name=\"sentencing\"/> Police later arrested and charged Bunting, Wagner, Vlassakis and Mark Haydon on 21 May 1999 for the murders. At the time of the arrest, Vlassakis lived in Bunting's home.<ref name=\"Newton2006\"/>\n\n==Trials and verdicts==\nThe trial of Bunting and Wagner lasted almost twelve months, the longest in the history of South Australia.

The foundation of [[Paksan]] dates from the late nineteenth century. In 1836, the Siamese assumed suzerainty over Laos.{{sfn|Brow|1976|p=48}} After 1865, the [[Haw wars|invasions of \"Hos\"]], Chinese gangs from southern China, affected the provinces of Xieng Khouang and Bolikhamsai (Borikhane). In 1876, the King of Siam, [[Rama V]], ordered the creation of the Muong Borikhane with the last survivors of the Ho invasion of 1874. The Muong of Borikhane was placed under the authority of Governor of [[Nong Khai Province|Nong Khai]].\n\nIn the 1890s, Christian missionaries of the Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris arrived on the Mekong River, a few miles from the mouth of the [[Nam Sane]]. They built a church at Paksan. By 1911, the Muong Borikhane had about 61 villages housing a population of about 4000 inhabitants. Paksane had grown to several thousand in 1937. On 14 April 1958, the soldiers of Muong Kao Post (Borikham District) under the command of sergeant May arrested Thao Am of Ban Boky.{{sfn|Great Britain|1958|p=98}}\n\nThe modern province was formed in 1986 from parts of the [[Vientiane Province]] and [[Khammouan|Khammuan]].{{sfn|Sachs|1997|p=18}} In recent times, religious tension has been apparent in the province.

The foundation of [[Paksan]] dates from the late nineteenth century. In 1836, the Siamese assumed suzerainty over Laos.{{sfn|Brow|1976|p=48}} After 1865, the [[Haw wars|invasions of \"Hos\"]], Chinese gangs from southern China, affected the provinces of Xieng Khouang and Bolikhamsai (Borikhane). In 1876, the King of Siam, [[Rama V]], ordered the creation of the Muong Borikhane with the last survivors of the Ho invasion of 1874. The Muong of Borikhane was placed under the authority of Governor of [[Nong Khai Province|Nong Khai]].\n\nIn the 1890s, Christian missionaries of the Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris arrived on the Mekong River, a few miles from the mouth of the [[Nam Sane]]. They built a church at Paksan. By 1911, the Muong Borikhane had about 61 villages housing a population of about 4000 inhabitants. Paksane had grown to several thousand in 1937. On 14 April 1958, the soldiers of Muong Kao Post (Borikham District) under the command of sergeant May arrested Thao Am of Ban Boky.{{sfn|Great Britain|1958|p=98}}\n\nThe modern province was formed in 1986 from parts of the [[Vientiane Province]] and [[Khammouan|Khammuan]].{{sfn|Sachs|1997|p=18}} In recent times, religious tension has been apparent in the province.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.
