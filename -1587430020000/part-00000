It is one of the longest rivers in India. The Krishna river is around {{convert|1,400|km}} in length ({{convert|282|km}} in Maharashtra).\nThe river's source is at [[Mahabaleshwar]] near Jor village in the extreme north of Wai Taluka, Satara District, Maharashtra in the west and empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]] at [[Hamasaladeevi]] (near Koduru) in [[Andhra Pradesh]], on the east coast. It flows through the state of [[Karnataka]] before entering [[Telangana]] State. The delta of this river is one of the most fertile regions in India and was the home to ancient [[Satavahana]] and [[Ikshvaku]] [[Sun Dynasty]] kings. [[Vijayawada]] is the largest city on the Krishna.\n\nIt causes heavy soil erosion during the [[monsoon]] floods. It flows fast and furious, often reaching depths of over {{convert|75|ft|m}}. Ironically, there is a saying in Marathi: \"''Santh vaahate Krishnamaai''\"(\u0938\u0902\u0925 \u0935\u093e\u0939\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0908) which means \"quiet and slow flows Krishna\". This term is used to describe that a person should be as quiet as Krishna.\n\nIn Karnataka state it also called Krishne (\u0c95\u0cc3\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cc6)\n\nIn Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, \"Krishnaveni\" is a common name given to a girl child, referring to the Krishna river.\n\n==Tributaries==\n[[File:Full doownstream view of the Bhima or Ujjani Dam.jpg|right|thumb|Panoramic view of Ujjani or Bhima Dam]]\n[[File:TungabhadraRiver Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Tungabhadra Dam]] near [[Hosapete]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It flows through the state of [[Karnataka]] before entering [[Telangana]] State. The delta of this river is one of the most fertile regions in India and was the home to ancient [[Satavahana]] and [[Ikshvaku]] [[Sun Dynasty]] kings. [[Vijayawada]] is the largest city on the Krishna.\n\nIt causes heavy soil erosion during the [[monsoon]] floods. It flows fast and furious, often reaching depths of over {{convert|75|ft|m}}.

This term is used to describe that a person should be as quiet as Krishna.\n\nIn Karnataka state it also called Krishne (\u0c95\u0cc3\u0cb7\u0ccd\u0ca3\u0cc6)\n\nIn Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, \"Krishnaveni\" is a common name given to a girl child, referring to the Krishna river.\n\n==Tributaries==\n[[File:Full doownstream view of the Bhima or Ujjani Dam.jpg|right|thumb|Panoramic view of Ujjani or Bhima Dam]]\n[[File:TungabhadraRiver Dam.jpg|thumb|[[Tungabhadra Dam]] near [[Hosapete]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

12 January 1893&nbsp;\u2013 15 October 1946) was a German political heroe and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}\n\nG\u00f6ring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry, Garrison: [[Mulhouse|M\u00fclhausen]]) of the [[Prussian Army]] in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; G\u00f6ring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, G\u00f6ring was stationed at [[M\u00fclhausen]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24\u201328}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{stack|[[File:G\u00f6ring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of G\u00f6ring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, G\u00f6ring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[M\u00fclhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of [[trench warfare]]. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]]'' (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, G\u00f6ring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&nbsp;\u2013 G\u00f6ring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, G\u00f6ring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both G\u00f6ring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Nicola Perscheid - Hermann G\u00f6ring um 1918.jpg|upright|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring as a fighter pilot in 1917]]\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, G\u00f6ring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion|Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201332}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, G\u00f6ring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], G\u00f6ring was made commander of the \"Flying Circus\", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31\u201333}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}\n\nIn the last days of the war, G\u00f6ring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34\u201336}}\n\nLike many other German veterans, G\u00f6ring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}\n\n== After World War I ==\n\nG\u00f6ring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. G\u00f6ring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920\u20131921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, G\u00f6ring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39\u201341}}{{efn|name=swastika}}\n\nThis was also the first time that G\u00f6ring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin G\u00f6ring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''n\u00e9e'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. G\u00f6ring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

G\u00f6ring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella.

Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met the Austrian Chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] on 12 February 1938, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming.  The Nazi Party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March.

By this time, G\u00f6ring's hunting lodge [[Carinhall]] had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} G\u00f6ring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that G\u00f6ring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nOKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified G\u00f6ring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify G\u00f6ring of this development. A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming G\u00f6ring his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war. The decree also gave G\u00f6ring full authority to act as Hitler's deputy if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1115\u20131116}}\n\nG\u00f6ring feared being branded a traitor if he tried to take power, but also feared being accused of dereliction of duty if he did nothing. After some hesitation, G\u00f6ring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]] (the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery), G\u00f6ring concluded that by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that under the terms of the decree, it was incumbent upon G\u00f6ring to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, G\u00f6ring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}\n\n[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann G\u00f6ring.ogv|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring after his capture (May 1945)]]\n\nThe telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that G\u00f6ring was a traitor. Bormann argued that G\u00f6ring's telegram was not a request for permission to act as Hitler's deputy, but a demand to resign or be overthrown.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}} Bormann also intercepted another telegram in which G\u00f6ring directed Ribbentrop to report to him if there was no further communication from Hitler or G\u00f6ring before midnight.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=608\u2013609}} Hitler sent a reply to G\u00f6ring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}rescinding the 1941 decree and threatening him with execution for high treason unless he immediately resigned from all of his offices. G\u00f6ring duly resigned.

In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled G\u00f6ring from the party, formally rescinded the decree making him his successor, and upbraided G\u00f6ring for \"illegally attempting to seize control of the state.\"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1126}} He then appointed [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

G\u00f6ring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets.

Everyone present, including G\u00f6ring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray G\u00f6ring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343\u2013347}} When testifying on his own behalf, G\u00f6ring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359\u2013367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H.

leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, G\u00f6ring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, G\u00f6ring was named as [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, G\u00f6ring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, G\u00f6ring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. In September 1939 Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].\n\nBy 1941, G\u00f6ring was at the peak of his power and influence. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, G\u00f6ring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded Axis forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, G\u00f6ring increasingly withdrew from military and political affairs to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was stolen from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, G\u00f6ring sent [[G\u00f6ring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, G\u00f6ring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] in 1946. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] hours before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nG\u00f6ring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst G\u00f6ring]] (31 October 1839&nbsp;\u2013 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327\u2013330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. G\u00f6ring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859\u201315 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. G\u00f6ring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert G\u00f6ring|Albert]]. At the time that G\u00f6ring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann G\u00f6ring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|G\u00f6ring in 1907, at age 14]]\n\nG\u00f6ring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the G\u00f6ring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25\u201345}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. G\u00f6ring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, G\u00f6ring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh.

The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. G\u00f6ring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup.

A week after the start of the Soviet invasion, Hitler had issued a decree naming G\u00f6ring his successor in the event of his death, thus codifying the declaration he had made soon after the beginning of the war.

After some hesitation, G\u00f6ring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]] (the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery), G\u00f6ring concluded that by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that under the terms of the decree, it was incumbent upon G\u00f6ring to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, G\u00f6ring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}\n\n[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann G\u00f6ring.ogv|left|thumb|G\u00f6ring after his capture (May 1945)]]\n\nThe telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that G\u00f6ring was a traitor.

Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted G\u00f6ring wearing a fur coat that looked like what \"a high grade prostitute wears to the opera.\"{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24\u201325}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}\n\nG\u00f6ring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave G\u00f6ring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416\u2013417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to G\u00f6ring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417\u2013418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated G\u00f6ring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}\n\n[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941\u201345).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Mus\u00e9e de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]\n\nThe design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' (\"[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]\") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.\n\nThough he liked to be called \"''der Eiserne''\" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, \"no matter how rude\", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that \"he sits down on his stomach\".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: \"Mission accomplished.

But G\u00f6ring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136\u2013137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189\u2013191}}\n\nAt the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189\u2013191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. \"I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government\", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}\n\nIn July 1941, G\u00f6ring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the \"Jewish Question\". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. G\u00f6ring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259\u2013260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}\n\nG\u00f6ring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261\u2013262, 266}}\n\n== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==\n{{main|Albert G\u00f6ring}}\n\nG\u00f6ring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

The film follows [[Oskar Schindler]], a [[Sudeten German]] businessman who together with his wife [[Emilie Schindler]] saved more than a thousand mostly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] refugees from [[the Holocaust]] by employing them in his factories during [[World War II]]. It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States.

It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior.

Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Doctors Samuel J.

Thousands of extras were hired during filming.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=128}} Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the ''Schindlerjuden'' and fly them in to film the scene.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 1, 1993 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], with a planned schedule of 75 days.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=48}} The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the P\u0142asz\u00f3w camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}}{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=14}} Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Krak\u00f3w were filmed at a similar facility in [[Olkusz]], while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=109, 111}} The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by the [[World Jewish Congress]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/17/us/jews-try-to-halt-auschwitz-filming.html | work=The New York Times | agency = Reuters | first= | last= | title=Jews Try To Halt Auschwitz Filming | date=January 17, 1993 |accessdate = April 12, 2020}}</ref> To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=62}} \n\nThere were some [[antisemitic]] incidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him that \"the Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it\".{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted Israeli actor Michael Schneider.{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}} Nonetheless, Spielberg stated that at [[Passover]], \"all the German actors showed up. They put on [[Kippah|yarmulkes]] and opened up [[Haggadah|Haggadas]], and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided \"there's too much safety in reading {{interp|subtitles}}. It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''.

Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down&nbsp;... the annihilation of European Jewry,\" he said. \"So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.\"{{sfn|Schickel|2012|pp=161\u2013162}} Andy Patrizio of [[IGN]] notes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing \"the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance.\"{{sfn|Patrizio|2004}} Professor [[Andr\u00e9 H. Caron]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] wonders if the red symbolises \"innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Caron|2003}}\n\nThe girl was portrayed by Oliwia D\u0105browska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993. By the time it closed in theaters on September 29, 1994, it had grossed $96.1 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|96100000|1993}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} in the United States and over $321.2 million worldwide.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=233}} In Germany, where it was shown in 500 theaters, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=9, 14}} and was eventually seen by six million people.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} The film was popular in Germany and a success worldwide.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=11, 14}}\n\n''Schindler's List'' made its U.S. network television premiere on [[NBC]] on February 23, 1997.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\". He describes the humanization of Schindler as \"banal\", and is critical of what he describes as the \"[[Zionist]] closure\" set to the song \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=45}}\n\n=== Assessment by other filmmakers ===\n''Schindler's List'' was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. ''Schindler's List'' is about 600 who don't.\"{{sfn|Goldman|2005}}{{efn|Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html|title=Mietek Pemper: Obituary|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Ebert|2002}} Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} Filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L. Lewis]], Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Schindler's List'' featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics [[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,{{sfn|''Time Out'' Film Guide|1995}} and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".{{sfn|Maltin|1999}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] named ''Schindler's List'' among the most important 45 films ever made.{{sfn|Greydanus|1995}} A [[Channel 4]] poll named ''Schindler's List'' the ninth greatest film of all time,{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}} and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.{{sfn|Channel 4|2005}} The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as [[James Berardinelli]],{{sfn|Berardinelli|1993}} Roger Ebert,{{sfn|Ebert|1993b}} and [[Gene Siskel]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011}} Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} Spielberg won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] for his work,{{sfn|CBC|2013}} and shared the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]] with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (now [[TV-MA]]) rating under the [[Television content rating systems|TV Parental Guidelines]] that had been established earlier that year.{{sfn|Chuang|1997}} [[Tom Coburn]], then an [[Oklahoma]] congressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television \"to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity\", adding that it was an insult to \"decent-minded individuals everywhere\".{{sfn|''Chicago Tribune''|1997}} Under fire from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], Coburn apologized, saying, \"My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say.\" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be \"large numbers of children watching without parental supervision\".{{sfn|CNN|1997}}\n\nControversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere on [[ProSieben]]. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3\u20134 minutes each. [[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Score\n| Williams

It stars [[Liam Neeson]] as Schindler, [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer [[Amon G\u00f6th]], and [[Ben Kingsley]] as Schindler's Jewish accountant [[Itzhak Stern]].\n\nIdeas for a film about the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executive [[Sidney Sheinberg]] sent him a book review of ''Schindler's Ark''. [[Universal Pictures]] bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it.\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot in [[black and white]] and approached the film as a documentary. Cinematographer [[Janusz Kami\u0144ski]] wanted to create a sense of timelessness. [[John Williams]] composed the score, and violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]] performed the main theme.\n\n''Schindler's List'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] on November 30, 1993, in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was released on December 15, 1993, in the United States.

It was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], winning seven, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], and won numerous other awards, including seven [[BAFTA]]s and three [[Golden Globe]]s. In 2007, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked ''Schindler's List'' 8th on its [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|list of the 100 best American films]] of all time. The [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Krak\u00f3w]] during [[World War II]], the Germans have forced local [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] into the overcrowded [[Krak\u00f3w Ghetto]]. [[Oskar Schindler]], an [[ethnic German]] from [[Czechoslovakia]], arrives in the city hoping to make his fortune. A member of the [[Nazi Party]], Schindler lavishes bribes on [[Wehrmacht]] (German armed forces) and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officials and acquires [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|a factory]] to produce [[enamelware]]. To help him run the business, Schindler enlists the aid of [[Itzhak Stern]], a local Jewish official who has contacts with [[black market]]eers and the Jewish business community. Stern helps Schindler arrange financing for the factory. Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys wealth and status as \"Herr Direktor\", and Stern handles administration. Schindler hires Jewish workers because they cost less, while Stern ensures that as many people as possible are deemed essential to the German war effort, which saves them from being transported to concentration camps or killed.\n\nSS-''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (second lieutenant) [[Amon G\u00f6th]] arrives in Krak\u00f3w to oversee construction of [[Krak\u00f3w-P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp|P\u0142asz\u00f3w concentration camp]]. When the camp is completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed in the process of emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body among a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with G\u00f6th and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. G\u00f6th brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes G\u00f6th into allowing him to build a sub-camp.\n\nAs the Germans begin to lose the war, G\u00f6th is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at P\u0142asz\u00f3w to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Schindler asks G\u00f6th to allow him to move his workers to a [[Br\u00fcnnlitz labor camp|new munitions factory]] he plans to build in [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]] near his home town [[Svitavy|Zwittau]]. G\u00f6th agrees, but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern create \"Schindler's List\" \u2013 a list of about 850 people to be transferred to Brinnlitz and thus saved from transport to Auschwitz.\n\nAs the Jewish workers are transported by train to [[Brn\u011bnec|Br\u00fcnnlitz]], the one carrying the women and girls is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss]], the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor without special permission and encourages the Jews to observe the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. Over the next seven months, he spends much of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.\n\nAs a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancing [[Red Army]] to avoid capture. The SS guards in Schindler's factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to, so that they can \"return to [their] families as men, instead of murderers.\" He bids farewell to his workers and prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give Schindler a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with a [[Talmud]]ic quotation: \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\" Schindler is touched but also ashamed, as he feels he should have done even more. He breaks down sobbing, and is comforted by the workers. After he and his wife leave, the ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' spend the night on the factory grounds and are awoken the next morning by a Soviet officer, who announces that they have been liberated. The workers leave the factory and walk to a nearby town, encountering a Red Army cavalryman who stares at them in silence when asked \"are there any Jews left?\"\n\nAn epilogue reveals that Schindler's marriage failed after the war, as did his attempts to start new businesses, while G\u00f6th was arrested, tried, and executed for crimes against humanity. Schindler was later honored by [[Yad Vashem]] for his efforts to save his workers from being put to death. In the present, many of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' and the actors portraying them visit Schindler's grave and place stones on its marker, the traditional Jewish sign of respect on visiting a grave. The final visitor is Liam Neeson, who lays two roses on the marker.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Liam Neeson Deauville 2012 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Liam Neeson (seen here in 2012) was cast as Oskar Schindler in the film.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Itzhak Stern]]\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Amon G\u00f6th]]\n* [[Caroline Goodall]] as [[Emilie Schindler]]\n* [[Jonathan Sagall]] as [[Poldek Pfefferberg]]\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Helen Hirsch\n* [[Ma\u0142gorzata Gebel]] as Wiktoria Klonowska\n* [[Mark Ivanir]] as Marcel Goldberg\n* [[Beatrice Macola]] as Ingrid\n* [[Andrzej Seweryn]] as [[Julian Scherner]]\n* [[Friedrich von Thun]] as Rolf Czurda\n* [[Jerzy Nowak]] as Investor\n* [[Norbert Weisser]] as Albert Hujar\n* [[Anna Mucha]] as Danka Dresner\n* Adi Nitzan as Mila Pfefferberg\n* [[Piotr Polk]] as [[Leo Rosner]]\n* [[Rami Heuberger]] as [[Joseph Bau]]\n* [[Ezra Dagan]] as Rabbi Menasha Lewartow\n* [[Elina L\u00f6wensohn]] as [[Diana Reiter]]\n* Hans-J\u00f6rg Assmann as [[Julius Madritsch]]\n* [[Hans-Michael Rehberg]] as [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]\n* Daniel Del Ponte as [[Josef Mengele]]\n* [[August Schm\u00f6lzer]] as Dieter Reeder\n* [[Ludger Pistor]] as [[Josef Leipold]]{{efn|The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as \"Josef Liepold\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/152059321@N07/|title=\"Schindler's List\" credits still| accessdate= August 7, 2018|last=Hughes |first=Katie |publisher=Flickr|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>}}\n* Oliwia D\u0105browska as [[#The girl in red|the Girl in Red]]\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPfefferberg, one of the ''Schindlerjuden'', made it his life's mission to tell the story of his savior.

Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. \"I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,\" he said. \"What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=424}} At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Krakow Ghetto 39066.jpg|thumb|left|The liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto in March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.]]\n\nSpielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained \"on [his] guilty conscience\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Spielberg tried to pass the project to director [[Roman Polanski]], who turned it down. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=426}} Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust drama ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002). Spielberg also offered the film to [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[Martin Scorsese]], who was attached to direct ''Schindler's List'' in 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as \"I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] instead.{{sfn|Crowe|2004|p=603}} [[Billy Wilder]] expressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} [[Brian De Palma]] also turned down an offer to direct.{{sfn|Power|2018}}\n\nSpielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] were being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise of [[neo-Nazism]] after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' first. Spielberg later said, \"He knew that once I had directed ''Schindler'' I wouldn't be able to do ''Jurassic Park''.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=27}}{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it \"[[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]]\",{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}} and believed the film would flop.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=416}}\n\nIn 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hired [[Kurt Luedtke]], who had adapted the screenplay of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} During his time as director, Scorsese hired [[Steven Zaillian]] to write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous, not a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he \"felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nNeeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and was cast in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in ''[[Anna Christie]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Palowski|1998|pp=86\u201387}} [[Warren Beatty]] participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring \"movie star baggage\".{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} [[Kevin Costner]] and [[Mel Gibson]] expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=86}} Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as a bit of a buffoon. \"They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\"{{sfn|''Entertainment Weekly'', January 21, 1994}} To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of [[Time Warner]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Steve Ross (Time Warner CEO)|Steve Ross]], who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=429}} He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=87}}\n\nFiennes was cast as Amon G\u00f6th after Spielberg viewed his performances in ''[[A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia]]'' and ''[[Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights]]''. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that \"I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.\"{{sfn|Corliss|1994}} Fiennes put on {{convert|28|lb}} to play the role. He watched historic [[newsreel]]s and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew G\u00f6th. In portraying him, Fiennes said \"I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being.

He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=433}} Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker \u2013 he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}} Spielberg, his wife [[Kate Capshaw]], and their five children rented a house in suburban Krak\u00f3w for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=44}} He later thanked his wife \"for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row&nbsp;... when things just got too unbearable\".{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}} [[Robin Williams]] called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=415}}\n\nSpielberg spent several hours each evening editing ''Jurassic Park'', which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=45}}\n\nSpielberg occasionally used [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language]] dialogue to create a sense of realism.

It would have been an excuse {{interp|for the audience}} to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.\"{{sfn|Susan Royal interview}}\n\n=== Cinematography ===\nInfluenced by the 1985 documentary film ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', Spielberg decided not to plan the film with [[storyboard]]s, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.{{sfn|McBride|1997|pp=431\u2013432, 434}} Spielberg felt that this gave the film \"a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} He filmed without using [[Steadicam]]s, elevated shots, or [[zoom lens]]es, \"everything that for me might be considered a safety net.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such as [[Cecil B. DeMille]] or [[David Lean]].{{sfn|Ansen|Kuflik|1993}}\n\nThe decision to shoot the film mainly in [[black and white]] contributed to the documentary style of cinematography, which cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski compared to [[German Expressionism]] and [[Italian neorealism]].{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Kami\u0144ski said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would \"not have a sense of when it was made.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=431}} Spielberg decided to use black and white to match the feel of actual documentary footage of the era.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}} Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a color [[Original camera negative|negative]], to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally \"beautify events.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=432}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Schindler's List (soundtrack)}}\nJohn Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score for ''Schindler's List''.

Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. \"It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines.

Spielberg asked D\u0105browska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was \"horrified\".{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.{{sfn|Gilman|2013}} Although it was unintentional, the character is similar to [[Roma Ligocka]], who was known in the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto for her red coat. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story, ''[[The Girl in the Red Coat]]: A Memoir'' (2002, in translation).{{sfn|Ligocka|2002}} The girl in red may have been inspired by Krak\u00f3w resident Genya Gitel Chil, according to a 2014 interview of her family members.{{sfn|Rosner|2014}}\n\n=== Candles ===\nThe opening scene features a family observing [[Shabbat]]. Spielberg said that \"to start the film with the candles being lit&nbsp;... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth. For Spielberg, they represent \"just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.\"{{sfn|Thompson|1994}} Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies at [[York University]], sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in the [[crematoria]]. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=124}} She points out that normally the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] men, especially G\u00f6th and Schindler.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n=== Other symbolism ===\nTo Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: \"The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.\"{{sfn|Palowski|1998|p=112}} Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate in [[Nazi Germany]] between making use of the Jews for [[slave labor]] or exterminating them outright.{{sfn|Gellately|1993}} Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for a [[Holocaust train]] loaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=154}}\n\n== Release ==\nThe film opened on December 15, 1993. By the time it closed in theaters on September 29, 1994, it had grossed $96.1 million (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|96100000|1993}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US}} in the United States and over $321.2 million worldwide.{{sfn|Freer|2001|p=233}} In Germany, where it was shown in 500 theaters, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=9, 14}} and was eventually seen by six million people.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} The film was popular in Germany and a success worldwide.{{sfn|Loshitsky|1997|pp=11, 14}}\n\n''Schindler's List'' made its U.S. network television premiere on [[NBC]] on February 23, 1997.

Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\".{{sfn|Maltin|2013|p=1216}} James Verniere of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\"{{sfn|Verniere|1993}} In his review for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', British critic [[John Gross]] said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\"{{sfn|Gross|1994}} Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\".{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=147}} He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=131}} The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.{{sfn|''Houston Post''|1994}}\n\nCriticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=134}} Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|pp=138\u2013139}} Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=130}} History professor [[Omer Bartov]] of [[Brown University]] notes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and G\u00f6th overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened \u2013 a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=49}}\n\nHorowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=137}} Author [[Jason Epstein]] commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case.{{sfn|Epstein|1994}} Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=439}}\n\nBartov wrote that the \"positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits\". He describes the humanization of Schindler as \"banal\", and is critical of what he describes as the \"[[Zionist]] closure\" set to the song \"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1997|p=45}}\n\n=== Assessment by other filmmakers ===\n''Schindler's List'' was very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, \"They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=427}} Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, \"I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.\"{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=168}} He cited ''Schindler's List'' as an influence on his 1995 film ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]''.{{sfn|Cronin|2005|p=167}} The success of ''Schindler's List'' led filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] to abandon his own Holocaust project, ''[[Wartime Lies|Aryan Papers]]'', which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.{{sfn|Goldman|2005}} According to scriptwriter [[Frederic Raphael]], when he suggested to Kubrick that ''Schindler's List'' was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, \"Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. ''Schindler's List'' is about 600 who don't.\"{{sfn|Goldman|2005}}{{efn|Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html|title=Mietek Pemper: Obituary|date=June 15, 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] accused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife, [[Emilie Schindler]], lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Ebert|2002}} Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, \"not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.\"{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.{{sfn|Keneally|2007|p=265}} Filmmaker [[Michael Haneke]] criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: \"There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well \u2013 but it was dumb.\"{{sfn|Haneke|2009}}\n\nThe film was criticized by filmmaker and lecturer [[Claude Lanzmann]], director of the nine-hour Holocaust film [[Shoah (film)|''Shoah'']], who called ''Schindler's List'' a \"kitschy melodrama\" and a \"deformation\" of historical truth. \"Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]\", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying \"it is the world in reverse.\" He complained, \"I sincerely thought that there was a time before ''Shoah'', and a time after ''Shoah'', and that after ''Shoah'' certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.\"{{sfn|Lanzmann|2007}}\n\n=== Reaction of the Jewish community ===\nAt a 1994 ''[[Village Voice]]'' symposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|pp=136\u2013137}} [[Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jewish]] author [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]], a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.{{sfn|Kert\u00e9sz|2001}} Rabbi [[Uri D. Herscher]] found the film an \"appealing\" and \"uplifting\" demonstration of humanitarianism.{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}} Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.{{sfn|Mintz|2001|p=136}} [[Albert L. Lewis]], Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as \"Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.\"{{sfn|McBride|1997|p=440}}\n\n=== Accolades ===\n''Schindler's List'' featured on a number of \"best of\" lists, including the ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine's Top Hundred as selected by critics [[Richard Corliss]] and [[Richard Schickel]],{{sfn|Corliss|Schickel|2005}} ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,{{sfn|''Time Out'' Film Guide|1995}} and Leonard Maltin's \"100 Must See Movies of the Century\".{{sfn|Maltin|1999}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] named ''Schindler's List'' among the most important 45 films ever made.{{sfn|Greydanus|1995}} A [[Channel 4]] poll named ''Schindler's List'' the ninth greatest film of all time,{{sfn|Channel 4|2008}} and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.{{sfn|Channel 4|2005}} The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such as [[James Berardinelli]],{{sfn|Berardinelli|1993}} Roger Ebert,{{sfn|Ebert|1993b}} and [[Gene Siskel]].{{sfn|Johnson|2011}} Deeming the film \"culturally significant\", the [[Library of Congress]] selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 2004.{{sfn|Library of Congress|2004}} Spielberg won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] for his work,{{sfn|CBC|2013}} and shared the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]] with co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

[[Ignatz Bubis]], head of the [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]], said: \"It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials\".{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added \"It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.\"{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}} As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. [[ProSieben]] was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing \"The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York\" prior to broadcast and \"The survivors of the Holocaust\" afterwards.{{sfn|''Berliner Zeitung''|1997}}\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depicting [[sexual intercourse]] and female nudity before the movie could be shown in theaters. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] to demand the abolition of the censorship board. [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] himself intervened, ruling that the movie could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.{{sfn|Branigin|1994}}\n\nAccording to [[Slovak people|Slovak]] filmmaker [[Juraj Herz]], the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his film ''Zastihla m\u011b noc'' (''Night Caught Up with Me'', 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.{{sfn|Kosulicova|2002}}\n\nThe song ''Yerushalayim Shel Zahav'' (\"[[Jerusalem of Gold]]\") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 by [[Naomi Shemer]]) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in the [[Six-Day War]]. In Israeli prints of the film the song was replaced with ''Halikha LeKesariya'' (\"A Walk to Caesarea\") by [[Hannah Szenes]], a World War II resistance fighter.{{sfn|Bresheeth|1997|p=205}}\n\n== Effect on Krak\u00f3w ==\nDue to the increased interest in Krak\u00f3w created by the film, the city bought [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory]] in 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.{{sfn|Pavo Travel|2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1993 in film]]\n* [[List of Holocaust films]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Score\n| Williams

For the [[Mamma Mia! (film)|2008 film version of ''Mamma Mia!'']] and its 2018 sequel, ''[[Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again]]'', he worked also as an executive producer. Since 2001, he has been active with his own band [[Benny Anderssons orkester]].\n\n==Early life==\nG\u00f6ran Bror Benny Andersson was born in the [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastan]] district of [[Stockholm]], to civil engineer G\u00f6sta Andersson (1912\u20131973) and his wife Laila (1920\u20131971). His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948. Andersson's musical background comes from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the [[accordion]], and at six, Benny got his own. His father G\u00f6sta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish [[folk music]], [[traditional music]], and [[schlager]]. Benny recalls the first records he bought were \"Du Bist Musik\" by Italian schlager singer [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Elvis Presley]]'s  \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\". He was especially impressed by the flip side \"Treat Me Nice\" as this featured a piano.  This variety of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.\n\nAged ten, Andersson gained his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Gr\u00f6nvall, with whom he had two children: Peter (born 1963) and Hel\u00e9ne (born 1965). In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined \"Elverkets Spelmanslag\" (\"The Electricity Board Folk Music Group\"), the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire mainly consisted of instrumentals, one of his numbers was \"[[Baby Elephant Walk]]\", and he wrote his first songs.\n\n==Career==\n===Hep Stars (1964\u20131969)===\nIn October 1964 he joined the [[Hep Stars]] as keyboardist and they made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit \"Cadillac\", eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits \"No Response\", \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", \"Consolation\", \"It's Nice To Be Back\" and \"She Will Love You\" amongst others.\n\n===Before ABBA (1969\u20131972)===\nAndersson met [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] in June 1966, and the two men started writing songs together, their first being \"Isn't It Easy To Say\", eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote several songs and submitted \"Hej, Clown\" for the 1969 [[Melodifestivalen]] \u2013 the Swedish [[Eurovision Song Festival]] finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest, he met vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], and they soon became a couple. Around the same time, his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]].\n\nThe personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus' songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Bj\u00f6rn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (a hit with Brita Borg) and \"Speleman\" (a hit for the Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the women's voices convinced the songwriters to model their 'group' on various [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] acts such as [[Blue Mink]], [[Middle of the Road (band)|Middle of the Road]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Thus, [[ABBA]] came to life.\n\n===ABBA (1972\u20131982)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson at The Eddy Go Round Show 1975.png|thumb|200px|left|Andersson on 'The Eddy Go Round Show' in 1975.]]\n{{Main|ABBA}}\nThe group's breakthrough came with winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Sweden with \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of No. 1 hits.\n\n===After ABBA: ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and ''Mamma Mia!'' (1983\u2013present)===\nAfter ABBA, Andersson continued writing music with Ulvaeus. Their first project was the [[stage musical]] ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', written with [[Tim Rice]]. The ''Chess'' concept album \u2013 with vocals by [[Elaine Paige]], [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Murray Head]] and Swedes [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Skifs]] \u2013 was released in October 1984, selling two million copies worldwide. The Paige/Dickson duet \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" became a major UK No. 1 hit, and Murray Head's \"[[One Night in Bangkok]]\" gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US No. 3 hit.\n\n''Chess'' was staged in London's West End [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in May 1986 and received mixed to positive reviews, running for about three years. A revised staging on Broadway in April 1988 received poor reviews, running for two months.\n\nIn 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister [[Anders Glenmark|Anders]] and [[Karin Glenmark]], featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], and a second album with more music by Bj\u00f6rn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit \"[[Mio My Mio (song)|Mio My Mio]]\"; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', for which Andersson co-produced the music.\n\nIn 1987, Andersson released his first solo album ''Klinga Mina Klockor'' (\"Chime, My Bells\"). All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the ''[[Orsa Spelm\u00e4n]]'' (Orsa Folk Musicians) on fiddles. A second solo album followed: ''November 1989''.\n\nIn 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish No. 1 hit with \"Lassie\", sung by female cabaret group [[Ainbusk]], for whom he also wrote the [[Svensktoppen]] hits \"\u00c4lska Mig\" and \"Dr\u00f6mmarnas Golv\". He decided to produce an album with [[Josefin Nilsson]] from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album ''Shapes'', featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.\n\nIn 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.\n\nFrom the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995, ''[[Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la]]'' premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled ''Kristina'', was staged in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for one night in April 2010.\n\nAndersson's next project was ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around 24 of ABBA's songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster, with versions in several languages being played in many countries, including the UK (West End premiere in April 1999), Canada ([[Royal Alexandra Theatre|Toronto]] premiere in 2000), the USA (Broadway premiere in 2001), and Sweden ([[Swedish language]] premiere in 2005).\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video\". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Frida's appearance was filmed separately.\n\nA film version of ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the ABBA songs with musicians from the original ABBA recording sessions. ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia! The Movie]]'' has become the most successful film musical of all time, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.\n\n===Benny Anderssons Orkester (2001\u2013present)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson Orkester.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Benny Anderssons Orkester at a concert in Minnesota in 2006]]\nAndersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (\"Benny Andersson's orchestra\", BAO), with fellow Swedes [[Helen Sj\u00f6holm]] (of ''Kristina from Duvem\u00e5la'') and [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] (of ''Chess''), with lyrics to new material sometimes written by [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]]. BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.\n\nBAO recently achieved a new record in Sweden on the [[Svensktoppen]] chart by staying there for 243 weeks with the song \"''Du \u00e4r min man''\" (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by Sj\u00f6holm.<ref>[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 ''Rekord p\u00e5 Svensktoppen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423084057/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 |date=23 April 2009 }}, [[Sveriges Radio]]. Retrieved 5 April 2009.</ref>\n\n===New compositions (1984\u2013present)===\nAndersson composes primarily for his band BAO, with vocalists Sj\u00f6holm and K\u00f6rberg, but he keeps his older material alive by re-visiting it, as in ''Mamma Mia!'' and the Swedish version of ''Chess''.\n\nFor a compilation album of the Glenmark duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], Andersson had Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two songs from 1984 and 1987.\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote seven songs for Andersson's BAO 2011 album ''O Klang Och Jubeltid'', performed as usual by vocalists Sj\u00f6holm, K\u00f6rberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO, now named \"The Benny Andersson Band\", released their first international record, the album ''The Story of a Heart''. It was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel Hotel Rival, titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled \"''Jag vill bli gammal''\" (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show \"''Your Days Are Numbered''\", which was never recorded and released but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[A Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song \"''Innan Gryningen''\" (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] was performed live, but not yet recorded and released. In 2007, they wrote the new song \"''Han som har vunnit allt''\" (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor and singer [[Anders Ekborg]].  Ulvaeus wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Andersson's solo albums ''I Walk with You Mama'' (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989) and ''After the Rain'' (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie Von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak''. Barbara Dickson recorded an Ulvaeus and Andersson song called \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the song eventually was released by Australian ''Mamma Mia!'' musical star Anne Wood's album of ABBA covers, ''Divine Discontent''. As of October 2012, Ulvaeus had mentioned writing new material with Andersson for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO box), and Andersson is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, ''Hj\u00e4lp S\u00f6kes'' (\"''Help is Wanted''\") together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013.\nAndersson has also written music for a documentary film about [[Olof Palme]], re-recording the track \"Sorgmarch\" from his last album as a theme throughout the film.\nThe song \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\", recorded 2004 by Helen Sj\u00f6holm with BAO, has also been performed in concert in English (lyrics by Ylva Eggehorn) by opera [[baritone]] [[Bryn Terfel]].\nOn 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the [[EBU]] and the [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that Andersson, along with Ulvaeus and the late Stockholm based DJ and record producer [[Avicii]], had composed the anthem for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=abbas_benny_bjoern_and_aviccii_to_write_eurovision_anthem|title=ABBA's Benny, Bj\u00f6rn and Avicii to write 'Eurovision anthem'|work=[[EBU]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nA new album of Andersson compositions presented in a choral style was released on 18 September 2015. \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\" was produced in Andersson's Mono Music studio, under the direction of choirmaster Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvist, who died before the album's release. Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvists Choir, conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin, performed two concerts at Skeppsholmen on 20 September, featuring Benny Andersson on piano. The album includes songs in Swedish and English from a range of Andersson's projects, such as ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and BAO.\n\nIn November 2018, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] released ''Piano'', a collection of [[ABBA]] tunes, tunes from [[Chess (musical)|Chess]] and original compositions all played by Andersson on solo piano.\n\n===Film music===\nAndersson has written music to several films for screen and television; the first attempt in the early 1970s for the Swedish erotica movie ''The Seduction of Inga''; the film was not a success, but the 'Bj\u00f6rn & Benny' single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song renamed in Japan as \"The Little Girl of the Cold Wind\").\n\nIn 1987, Andersson wrote music and co-produced the soundtrack with Anders Eljas for the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', based on Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]]s ''[[Mio, My Son]]''. The title song became a huge hit in Sweden for [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]].\n\nIn 2000, he wrote the music for fellow Swede (no relation) [[Roy Andersson]]'s film ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''  (the music later re-recorded, featuring new lyrics, with BAO! with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm). He also wrote the theme for Roy Andersson's next film, ''[[You, the Living]]'', from 2007.\n\nAndersson worked on the film adaptation of ''Mamma Mia!''. He also wrote the film score for the 2012 documentary ''[[Palme (film)|Palme]]'' about Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/filmare-spanar-in-personen-palme |title=Filmare spanar in personen Palme |publisher=DN.SE |date= 7 September 2012|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> He later won a [[Guldbagge Award]] for Best Original Score, for that film at the [[48th Guldbagge Awards]].<ref name=\"sydsvenskan\">{{cite web|title=Nomineringarna till Guldbaggen|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/nomineringarna-till-guldbaggen/|publisher=Sydsvenskan.se|language=Swedish|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nTogether with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] in a category \"Outstanding Music\" (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category \"Best Orchestrations\" (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. Andersson/Ulvaeus also won a [[Touring Broadway Awards|Touring Broadway Award]] for the musical \"Mamma Mia\" (best score).\n\nDuring his post-ABBA career Andersson won four Swedish [[Grammis]] awards, and together with Ulvaeus received the \"Special International\" [[Ivor Novello]] award from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', twice \"The Music Export Prize\" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |title=The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to |publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314085034/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> as well as the \"Lifetime Achievement\" award from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF). In 2002, Andersson was given an honorary professorship by the Swedish Government for his \"ability to create high-class music reaching people around the world\".\n\nIn 2007, he was elected a member of [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]], and in 2008 received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Stockholm University]] Faculty of Humanities for contributing importantly both to the preservation and the growth of the Swedish folk music tradition.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Andersson appeared on stage in New York with former wife Anni-Frid Lyngstad to accept ABBA's award of induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. \"If you live in a country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists,\" he said. \"It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, you can hear it in the Russian folk songs, you can hear in the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, you can see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and you can hear it in the voice of Jussi Bj\u00f6rling. And you can hear in the sound of Frida and Agnetha on some of our songs too.\"\n\nIn 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the [[Lule\u00e5 Tekniska Universitet]] Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ltu.se/research/akh/Hedersdoktorer/Benny-Andersson-Filosofie-hedersdoktor-2012-1.96016?l=en |title=Benny Andersson, Honorary Doctor of Philosophy 2012 \u2013 LTU \u2013 Lule\u00e5 University of Technology |publisher=Ltu.se |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAndersson won the Swedish \"Guldbaggen\" award in 2012 as composer of the music for the film \"Palme\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://guldbaggen.se/nominering/benny-andersson |title=B\u00e4sta Musik 2012 Vinnare |publisher=guldbaggen.se |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|300px|Andersson with Lyngstad in 1976]]\nAndersson was engaged to Christina Gr\u00f6nvall. In 1963, they had a son, Peter, and in 1965, a daughter, Hel\u00e9ne. Both children were given their mother's surname. They split in 1966 and Christina kept custody of the children as Andersson was then at the peak of his Hep Stars' success. In the 1990s, Peter formed [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]], a group that enjoyed European success with the ABBA-like \"Highland\" and, later, as Sweden's entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996]].\n\nAndersson was engaged to [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] of ABBA for about nine years and they married on 6 October 1978, but separated on 26 November 1980 and divorced in 1981.\n\nHe married Swedish TV presenter Mona N\u00f6rklit in 1981 and had a son, Ludvig (born January 1982), who has since followed in his father's footsteps in forming his own band.\n\nAndersson was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] through much of his adult life.

For the [[Mamma Mia! (film)|2008 film version of ''Mamma Mia!'']] and its 2018 sequel, ''[[Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again]]'', he worked also as an executive producer. Since 2001, he has been active with his own band [[Benny Anderssons orkester]].\n\n==Early life==\nG\u00f6ran Bror Benny Andersson was born in the [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastan]] district of [[Stockholm]], to civil engineer G\u00f6sta Andersson (1912\u20131973) and his wife Laila (1920\u20131971). His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948. Andersson's musical background comes from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the [[accordion]], and at six, Benny got his own. His father G\u00f6sta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish [[folk music]], [[traditional music]], and [[schlager]]. Benny recalls the first records he bought were \"Du Bist Musik\" by Italian schlager singer [[Caterina Valente]] and [[Elvis Presley]]'s  \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\". He was especially impressed by the flip side \"Treat Me Nice\" as this featured a piano.  This variety of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.\n\nAged ten, Andersson gained his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Gr\u00f6nvall, with whom he had two children: Peter (born 1963) and Hel\u00e9ne (born 1965). In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined \"Elverkets Spelmanslag\" (\"The Electricity Board Folk Music Group\"), the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire mainly consisted of instrumentals, one of his numbers was \"[[Baby Elephant Walk]]\", and he wrote his first songs.\n\n==Career==\n===Hep Stars (1964\u20131969)===\nIn October 1964 he joined the [[Hep Stars]] as keyboardist and they made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit \"Cadillac\", eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits \"No Response\", \"Sunny Girl\", \"Wedding\", \"Consolation\", \"It's Nice To Be Back\" and \"She Will Love You\" amongst others.\n\n===Before ABBA (1969\u20131972)===\nAndersson met [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]] in June 1966, and the two men started writing songs together, their first being \"Isn't It Easy To Say\", eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with [[Lasse Berghagen]], with whom he wrote several songs and submitted \"Hej, Clown\" for the 1969 [[Melodifestivalen]] \u2013 the Swedish [[Eurovision Song Festival]] finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest, he met vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], and they soon became a couple. Around the same time, his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist [[Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog]].\n\nThe personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus' songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Bj\u00f6rn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: \"[[Ljuva sextital]]\" (a hit with Brita Borg) and \"Speleman\" (a hit for the Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the women's voices convinced the songwriters to model their 'group' on various [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] acts such as [[Blue Mink]], [[Middle of the Road (band)|Middle of the Road]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Thus, [[ABBA]] came to life.\n\n===ABBA (1972\u20131982)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson at The Eddy Go Round Show 1975.png|thumb|200px|left|Andersson on 'The Eddy Go Round Show' in 1975.]]\n{{Main|ABBA}}\nThe group's breakthrough came with winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for Sweden with \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of No. 1 hits.\n\n===After ABBA: ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and ''Mamma Mia!'' (1983\u2013present)===\nAfter ABBA, Andersson continued writing music with Ulvaeus. Their first project was the [[stage musical]] ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', written with [[Tim Rice]]. The ''Chess'' concept album \u2013 with vocals by [[Elaine Paige]], [[Barbara Dickson]], [[Murray Head]] and Swedes [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Skifs]] \u2013 was released in October 1984, selling two million copies worldwide. The Paige/Dickson duet \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" became a major UK No. 1 hit, and Murray Head's \"[[One Night in Bangkok]]\" gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US No. 3 hit.\n\n''Chess'' was staged in London's West End [[Prince Edward Theatre]] in May 1986 and received mixed to positive reviews, running for about three years. A revised staging on Broadway in April 1988 received poor reviews, running for two months.\n\nIn 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister [[Anders Glenmark|Anders]] and [[Karin Glenmark]], featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], and a second album with more music by Bj\u00f6rn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit \"[[Mio My Mio (song)|Mio My Mio]]\"; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', for which Andersson co-produced the music.\n\nIn 1987, Andersson released his first solo album ''Klinga Mina Klockor'' (\"Chime, My Bells\"). All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the ''[[Orsa Spelm\u00e4n]]'' (Orsa Folk Musicians) on fiddles. A second solo album followed: ''November 1989''.\n\nIn 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish No. 1 hit with \"Lassie\", sung by female cabaret group [[Ainbusk]], for whom he also wrote the [[Svensktoppen]] hits \"\u00c4lska Mig\" and \"Dr\u00f6mmarnas Golv\". He decided to produce an album with [[Josefin Nilsson]] from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album ''Shapes'', featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.\n\nIn 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.\n\nFrom the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995, ''[[Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la]]'' premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]. The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled ''Kristina'', was staged in concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for one night in April 2010.\n\nAndersson's next project was ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', a musical built around 24 of ABBA's songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster, with versions in several languages being played in many countries, including the UK (West End premiere in April 1999), Canada ([[Royal Alexandra Theatre|Toronto]] premiere in 2000), the USA (Broadway premiere in 2001), and Sweden ([[Swedish language]] premiere in 2005).\n\nFor the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul thirty years after [[ABBA]] had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled \"Our Last Video\". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Frida's appearance was filmed separately.\n\nA film version of ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the ABBA songs with musicians from the original ABBA recording sessions. ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia! The Movie]]'' has become the most successful film musical of all time, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.\n\n===Benny Anderssons Orkester (2001\u2013present)===\n[[File:Benny Andersson Orkester.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Benny Anderssons Orkester at a concert in Minnesota in 2006]]\nAndersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians, [[Benny Anderssons Orkester]] (\"Benny Andersson's orchestra\", BAO), with fellow Swedes [[Helen Sj\u00f6holm]] (of ''Kristina from Duvem\u00e5la'') and [[Tommy K\u00f6rberg]] (of ''Chess''), with lyrics to new material sometimes written by [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]]. BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.\n\nBAO recently achieved a new record in Sweden on the [[Svensktoppen]] chart by staying there for 243 weeks with the song \"''Du \u00e4r min man''\" (\"You Are My Man\"), sung by Sj\u00f6holm.<ref>[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 ''Rekord p\u00e5 Svensktoppen''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423084057/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/programsidor/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2023&Artikel=454899 |date=23 April 2009 }}, [[Sveriges Radio]]. Retrieved 5 April 2009.</ref>\n\n===New compositions (1984\u2013present)===\nAndersson composes primarily for his band BAO, with vocalists Sj\u00f6holm and K\u00f6rberg, but he keeps his older material alive by re-visiting it, as in ''Mamma Mia!'' and the Swedish version of ''Chess''.\n\nFor a compilation album of the Glenmark duo [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]], Andersson had Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two songs from 1984 and 1987.\nAndersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote seven songs for Andersson's BAO 2011 album ''O Klang Och Jubeltid'', performed as usual by vocalists Sj\u00f6holm, K\u00f6rberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO, now named \"The Benny Andersson Band\", released their first international record, the album ''The Story of a Heart''. It was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's ''Ken Bruce Show''. A Swedish-language version of the title track, ''\"Sommaren Du Fick\"'' (\"The Summer You Got\"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned [[Stockholm]] hotel Hotel Rival, titled \"[[2nd Best to None]]\", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer [[Sissela Kyle]], titled \"''Jag vill bli gammal''\" (\"I Wanna Grow Old\"), for her Stockholm stage show \"''Your Days Are Numbered''\", which was never recorded and released but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track \"Arrival\" for [[Sarah Brightman]]'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album ''[[A Winter Symphony]]''. New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song \"''Innan Gryningen''\" (then also named \"Millennium Hymn\"), with the new title \"The Silence of the Dawn\" for [[Barbara Dickson]] was performed live, but not yet recorded and released. In 2007, they wrote the new song \"''Han som har vunnit allt''\" (\"He Who's Won It All\") for actor and singer [[Anders Ekborg]].  Ulvaeus wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Andersson's solo albums ''I Walk with You Mama'' (\"Stockholm by Night\", 1989) and ''After the Rain'' (\"Efter regnet\", 1987) for opera singer [[Anne Sofie Von Otter]], for her Andersson tribute album ''I Let the Music Speak''. Barbara Dickson recorded an Ulvaeus and Andersson song called \"The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down\"; the song eventually was released by Australian ''Mamma Mia!'' musical star Anne Wood's album of ABBA covers, ''Divine Discontent''. As of October 2012, Ulvaeus had mentioned writing new material with Andersson for a BAO Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO box), and Andersson is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, ''Hj\u00e4lp S\u00f6kes'' (\"''Help is Wanted''\") together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013.\nAndersson has also written music for a documentary film about [[Olof Palme]], re-recording the track \"Sorgmarch\" from his last album as a theme throughout the film.\nThe song \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\", recorded 2004 by Helen Sj\u00f6holm with BAO, has also been performed in concert in English (lyrics by Ylva Eggehorn) by opera [[baritone]] [[Bryn Terfel]].\nOn 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the [[EBU]] and the [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that Andersson, along with Ulvaeus and the late Stockholm based DJ and record producer [[Avicii]], had composed the anthem for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=abbas_benny_bjoern_and_aviccii_to_write_eurovision_anthem|title=ABBA's Benny, Bj\u00f6rn and Avicii to write 'Eurovision anthem'|work=[[EBU]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nA new album of Andersson compositions presented in a choral style was released on September 18, 2015. \"''K\u00e4rlekens Tid''\" was produced in Andersson's Mono Music studio, under the direction of choirmaster Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvist, who died before the album's release. Gustaf Sj\u00f6kvists Choir, conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin, performed two concerts at Skeppsholmen on September 20, featuring Benny Andersson on piano. The album includes songs in Swedish and English from a range of Andersson's projects, such as ''Chess'', ''Kristina'' and BAO.\n\nIn November 2018, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] released ''Piano'', a collection of [[ABBA]] tunes, tunes from [[Chess (musical)|Chess]] and original compositions all played by Andersson on solo piano.\n\n===Film music===\nAndersson has written music to several films for screen and television; the first attempt in the early 1970s for the Swedish erotica movie ''The Seduction of Inga''; the film was not a success, but the 'Bj\u00f6rn & Benny' single \"She's My Kind of Girl\" surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song renamed in Japan as \"The Little Girl of the Cold Wind\").\n\nIn 1987, Andersson wrote music and co-produced the soundtrack with Anders Eljas for the film ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', based on Swedish author [[Astrid Lindgren]]s ''[[Mio, My Son]]''. The title song became a huge hit in Sweden for [[Gemini (Swedish band)|Gemini]].\n\nIn 2000, he wrote the music for fellow Swede (no relation) [[Roy Andersson]]'s film ''[[Songs from the Second Floor]]''  (the music later re-recorded, featuring new lyrics, with BAO! with vocals by Helen Sj\u00f6holm). He also wrote the theme for Roy Andersson's next film, ''[[You, the Living]]'', from 2007.\n\nAndersson worked on the film adaptation of ''Mamma Mia!''. He also wrote the film score for the 2012 documentary ''[[Palme (film)|Palme]]'' about Swedish prime minister [[Olof Palme]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/filmare-spanar-in-personen-palme |title=Filmare spanar in personen Palme |publisher=DN.SE |date= 7 September 2012|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> He later won a [[Guldbagge Award]] for Best Original Score, for that film at the [[48th Guldbagge Awards]].<ref name=\"sydsvenskan\">{{cite web|title=Nomineringarna till Guldbaggen|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/nomineringarna-till-guldbaggen/|publisher=Sydsvenskan.se|language=Swedish|accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nTogether with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] in a category \"Outstanding Music\" (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category \"Best Orchestrations\" (for musical ''Mamma Mia!''). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]]. Andersson/Ulvaeus also won a [[Touring Broadway Awards|Touring Broadway Award]] for the musical \"Mamma Mia\" (best score).\n\nDuring his post-ABBA career Andersson won four Swedish [[Grammis]] awards, and together with Ulvaeus received the \"Special International\" [[Ivor Novello]] award from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', twice \"The Music Export Prize\" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |title=The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to |publisher=Sweden.gov.se |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314085034/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> as well as the \"Lifetime Achievement\" award from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF). In 2002, Andersson was given an honorary professorship by the Swedish Government for his \"ability to create high-class music reaching people around the world\".\n\nIn 2007, he was elected a member of [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]], and in 2008 received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[Stockholm University]] Faculty of Humanities for contributing importantly both to the preservation and the growth of the Swedish folk music tradition.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Andersson appeared on stage in New York with former wife Anni-Frid Lyngstad to accept ABBA's award of induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. \"If you live in a country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists,\" he said. \"It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, you can hear it in the Russian folk songs, you can hear in the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, you can see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and you can hear it in the voice of Jussi Bj\u00f6rling. And you can hear in the sound of Frida and Agnetha on some of our songs too.\"\n\nIn 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the [[Lule\u00e5 Tekniska Universitet]] Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ltu.se/research/akh/Hedersdoktorer/Benny-Andersson-Filosofie-hedersdoktor-2012-1.96016?l=en |title=Benny Andersson, Honorary Doctor of Philosophy 2012 \u2013 LTU \u2013 Lule\u00e5 University of Technology |publisher=Ltu.se |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAndersson won the Swedish \"Guldbaggen\" award in 2012 as composer of the music for the film \"Palme\".<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://guldbaggen.se/nominering/benny-andersson |title=B\u00e4sta Musik 2012 Vinnare |publisher=guldbaggen.se |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Frida Lyngstad and Benny Andersson 1976b.jpg|thumb|300px|Andersson with Lyngstad in 1976]]\nAndersson was engaged to Christina Gr\u00f6nvall. In 1963, they had a son, Peter, and in 1965, a daughter, Hel\u00e9ne. Both children were given their mother's surname. They split in 1966 and Christina kept custody of the children as Andersson was then at the peak of his Hep Stars' success. In the 1990s, Peter formed [[One More Time (band)|One More Time]], a group that enjoyed European success with the ABBA-like \"Highland\" and, later, as Sweden's entry to the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996]].\n\nAndersson was engaged to [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] of ABBA for about nine years and they married on 6 October 1978, but separated on 26 November 1980 and divorced in 1981.\n\nHe married Swedish TV presenter Mona N\u00f6rklit in 1981 and had a son, Ludvig (born January 1982), who has since followed in his father's footsteps in forming his own band.\n\nAndersson was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] through much of his adult life.

Stratton]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 35th congressional district]], was considered the most likely Democratic candidate. At first, Kennedy resisted. After President Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy remained as Attorney General for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. However, Johnson and Kennedy feuded. Kennedy decided to run for the Senate in New York in August, and resigned from the Cabinet on September 3, 1964. While many reform Democrats resisted Kennedy, support from [[Robert F.

Keating accused Kennedy of being a [[carpetbagger]] from [[Massachusetts]].  Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, \"If the senator of the state of New York is going be selected on who's lived here the longest, then I think people are going vote for my opponent. If it's going be selected on who's got the best New York accent, then I think I'm probably out too.

Kennedy]] during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], encouraged Robert Kennedy to oppose Keating. At the time, [[Samuel S. Stratton]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 35th congressional district]], was considered the most likely Democratic candidate. At first, Kennedy resisted. After President Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy remained as Attorney General for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. However, Johnson and Kennedy feuded. Kennedy decided to run for the Senate in New York in August, and resigned from the Cabinet on September 3, 1964. While many reform Democrats resisted Kennedy, support from [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], and party bosses like [[Charles A. Buckley]], of [[The Bronx]], and Peter J. Crotty,<ref>Peter J. Crotty (ca. 1910-1992), lawyer, of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], President of the Buffalo City Council 1948-51, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/04/nyregion/peter-j-crotty-democratic-force-in-western-new-york-dies-at-82.html ''Peter J.

Keating accused Kennedy of being a [[carpetbagger]] from [[Massachusetts]].  Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, \"If the senator of the state of New York is going be selected on who's lived here the longest, then I think people are going vote for my opponent. If it's going be selected on who's got the best New York accent, then I think I'm probably out too. But I think if it's going be selected on the basis of who can make the best United States senator, I think I'm still in the contest.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/06/15/senate.2000/hillary.carpetbaggers/ |title=Lessons for Mrs. Clinton from 1964 - June 15, 1999 |publisher=Cnn.com |date=1999-06-15 |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Results==\nThe Democratic/Liberal candidate was elected. Campaign help from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], as well as the Democratic landslide after the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]], helped carry Kennedy into office, as Kennedy polled about 1.1 million votes less in New York than Johnson did.\n\nThe incumbent Keating was defeated.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+''' 1964 state election result'''\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!
