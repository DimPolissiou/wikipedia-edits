Though Turner acknowledged that the Lyman Family had been portrayed as a cult she argued against using the word to describe them. In accordance with the customs of the Lyman Family, Turner was not raised by her mother, but she and her younger sister were eventually ejected from the Family after their mother chose to leave.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peleg |first1=Oren |title=How to Understand Charles Manson: Hire a Screenwriter Who Grew Up in a Cult |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/charles-manson-charlie-says-cult-movie-mary-harron-guinevere-turner |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Turner considered rejoining the group when she was 18, but eventually chose to attend college instead in part because of the deeply misogynistic and sexist attitudes of the group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Guinevere |title=My Childhood in a Cult |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/my-childhood-in-a-cult |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nTurner and ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' director [[Mary Harron]] wrote a screenplay, which ended up being selected for the [[American Psycho (film)|film version]] of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]''.

Director [[Kevin Smith]] was a fan of the movie, particularly a scene in it wherein, in an imagined sequence, some of a character's friends chastise her for \"selling out\" and sleeping with a man, and used it as an inspiration for his own take on a similar theme in his own film ''[[Chasing Amy]]''. Turner has cameos in both ''Chasing Amy'' and Smith's later film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. Smith also named [[Joey Lauren Adams]]' character in Smith's ''[[Mallrats]]'' after Turner.\n\nA writer and story editor for the first two seasons of ''[[The L Word]]'', Turner also made several guest appearances on the show as [[Alice Pieszecki]]'s screenwriter ex-girlfriend, [[Lesbian X|Gabby]].\n\nIn 2005, Turner wrote the script for ''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]''.

Turner''' (born May 23, 1968){{citation needed|date = May 2019}} is an American actress, screenwriter and film director. She has written such films as ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'' and ''[[The Notorious Bettie Page]]'' and played the lead role of the [[dominatrix]] Tanya Cheex in ''[[Preaching to the Perverted (film)|Preaching to the Perverted]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nTurner was born in [[Boston]], and is the oldest of six children. She has three brothers and two sisters. She is also an aunt to one niece and two nephews. Her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth Hobbs Turner, was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1944 during [[World War II]].<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BqC-QQvnZBY/</ref>\n\nTurner spent the first eleven years of her life as part of the Lyman Family, raised in various communes around the U.S. with over 100 members who were devotees of [[Mel Lyman]] and who believed they would eventually live on [[Venus]]. Though Turner acknowledged that the Lyman Family had been portrayed as a cult she argued against using the word to describe them. In accordance with the customs of the Lyman Family, Turner was not raised by her mother, but she and her younger sister were eventually ejected from the Family after their mother chose to leave.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peleg |first1=Oren |title=How to Understand Charles Manson: Hire a Screenwriter Who Grew Up in a Cult |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/charles-manson-charlie-says-cult-movie-mary-harron-guinevere-turner |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Turner considered rejoining the group when she was 18, but eventually chose to attend college instead in part because of the deeply misogynistic and sexist attitudes of the group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Guinevere |title=My Childhood in a Cult |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/my-childhood-in-a-cult |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nTurner and ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' director [[Mary Harron]] wrote a screenplay, which ended up being selected for the [[American Psycho (film)|film version]] of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]''. She has a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film, in which she delivers the in-joke, \"I'm not a [[lesbian]]!\". There is also a line about attending [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Turner's real-life [[alma mater]].\n\nTurner emerged on the scene with the film ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'', which she co-wrote and co-produced with her then-girlfriend, [[Rose Troche]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A03E1DA133AF933A25755C0A962958260|title=Review/Film; Girl Meets Girl, Laughter Included|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York Times Company|date=June 10, 1994|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref> Turner also starred in the film, portraying a young woman named Max whose friends help her find a new girlfriend, Ely, portrayed by VS Brodie. Director [[Kevin Smith]] was a fan of the movie, particularly a scene in it wherein, in an imagined sequence, some of a character's friends chastise her for \"selling out\" and sleeping with a man, and used it as an inspiration for his own take on a similar theme in his own film ''[[Chasing Amy]]''. Turner has cameos in both ''Chasing Amy'' and Smith's later film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. Smith also named [[Joey Lauren Adams]]' character in Smith's ''[[Mallrats]]'' after Turner.\n\nA writer and story editor for the first two seasons of ''[[The L Word]]'', Turner also made several guest appearances on the show as [[Alice Pieszecki]]'s screenwriter ex-girlfriend, [[Lesbian X|Gabby]].\n\nIn 2005, Turner wrote the script for ''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]''. It was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[27th Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Screenplay]] in 2006. In the documentary ''Tales from the Script'', she stated in an interview that director [[Uwe Boll]] only used about 25% of her screenplay.<ref>{{cite

A doctoral student must already hold a master's degree, and are typically employed by the university, or enjoy a similar grant, and will be called ''tohtorikoulutettava'' (doctoral candidate), ''tutkija'' (researcher) or ''assistentti'' (teaching assistant). Besides post-doctoral researchers (''tutkijatohtori'') and senior teaching assistants (''yliassistentti''), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions such as teaching researcher (''opettava tutkija''). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as e.g. ''erikoistutkija'' (\"special researcher\") or ''yliopistotutkija'' (university researcher). Docent (''dosentti'') is a non-professiorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (''professori'') are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there's no direct equivalent of an assistant / associate / full professor career path, although [[Aalto University]] is introducing these. Qualifications for a professor's position are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (''laitosjohtaja'' or ''osastonjohtaja'') and deans (head of faculty, ''dekaani''). The leader of a university is called a rector (''rehtori''), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (''vararehtori''). Vice-rectors may retain their professor's positions or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (''kansleri''), which works more with outreach and public relations than daily management.\n\n==France==\n{{main|Academic ranks in France}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!title| ||title|Faculty||title|Research-only||title|Teaching-only||title|Part-time\n|-\n!rowspan=2 title|Permanent positions||Professeur des universit\u00e9s ''or'' Directeur d'\u00e9tudes||Directeur de recherche|| ||Professeur des universit\u00e9s associ\u00e9\n|-\n!Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences||Charg\u00e9 de recherche||professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 ''or'' professeur certifi\u00e9||Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences associ\u00e9\n|-\n!rowspan=2 title|Temporary positions||Attach\u00e9 temporaire d'enseignement et de recherches (<small>ATER</small>)||Post-doctorant||rowspan=2 colspan=2|Charg\u00e9 d'enseignement\n|-\n!Doctorant contractuel charg\u00e9 d'enseignement||Doctorant contractuel\n|}\n\nIn French business schools, ranks are the same as in the United States: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and finally (Full) Professor.\n\n==Germany==\n{{main|Academic ranks in Germany}}\n\n==Greece==\n* Professor Emeritus ({{Lang-el|\u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}} (male) / {{lang|el|\u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 or \u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1}} (female)). \u0391n honorary title for people at the rank of Professor who have reached the legal age for retirement; If they wish, they have the right, for a limited time after retirement, to continue their research projects. \n* Professor (\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Associate Professor (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Assistant Professor (\u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Lecturer (in universities and technical universities: \u039b\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (both male and female) / in technological educational institutes: \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd (male) / \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd (female)). \u0399n universities and technical universities this academic rank existed only from 1982 to 2011, but people holding the rank remain as teaching staff until retirement.<ref>[http://www.mred.tuc.gr/p0141.htm \"Academic Ranks (in Greece)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916085305/http://www.mred.tuc.gr/p0141.htm |date=2006-09-16 }}; [http://www.posdep.gr/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=991&Itemid=438 \"Lecturers after Law 4009\"].</ref>\n* Laboratory Teaching Staff member ({{Lang-el|\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0394\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd (\u0395.\u0394\u0399.\u03a0.)}}).

Until the early 1990s no upward mobility was available in the Icelandic system. Most university teachers were hired as \"pr\u00f3fessor.\" A \"d\u00f3sent\" or a \"lektor\" wishing to ascend to a higher rank had to apply for a new position when it became available. Currently (since the 1990s) much more university teachers are hired as junior rank \"lektor\" and are promoted to \"d\u00f3sent\" and \"pr\u00f3fessor\" if their work proves worthy of it.\n\n* ''Pr\u00f3fessor''\n* ''D\u00f3sent'' (associate-professors)\n* ''Lektor'' (assistant-professors)\n\n==India==\n{{main|Academic ranks in India}}\n\n'''Regular Academic ranks''' (Hierarchy from top): Academic institutions in India have the mandate of teaching, training and research.

To have 10% as maximum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.\n\n* Emeritus professor (Profesor Em\u00e9rito) - For this recognition, the candidate should be faculty member (former ordinary professor in retiring process).\n* Honorary professor (Profesor Honorario) - For this recognition, the candidate is not related to a faculty member. For instance, in this category is the Doctor Honoris Causa.\n\n'''Research Professors''': Principally, full-time research position with few teaching responsibilities. Research professorships are almost always funded by grants or fellowships apart from the regular university budget. He is designated because of its academic excellence. He has a special bonus of fifty percent (50%) of its total payments. The competent authority of each university evaluates every two years, the production of the ordinary professors, for their permanence as a researcher.\n\n'''Ordinary Professors''': Often full-time (with exclusivity) professors with research competences. Principal faculty. To have 25% as minimum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.\n\n* Full professor (Profesor Principal) - PhD and MSc required, and former Associate professor or 15 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.\n* Associate professor (Profesor Asociado) - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and former Assistant professor or 10 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.\n* Assistant professor (Profesor Auxiliar) - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and 5 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.\n\n'''Lecturer (Hired Professors)''': Often part-time (with non-exclusivity) professors. Complementary faculty. Generally, the primary employer is not the university with which they have the status. Principally, this kind of professor come from practitioner market and not develop research activities. MSc required.\n\nIn addition, the universities developed prior ranks, as junior temporary rank, to get experience and training (with strong motivation to be ordinary professor):\n\n* '''Instructor (Instructor, Jefe de Pr\u00e1ctica)''' - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level. \n* '''Teaching/Research Assistant (Asistente Acad\u00e9mico/Investigador)''' - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level.\n\nThe lectures are usually hired by private universities as they can offer this type of part-time contract. The instructors are usually hired by public universities as their type of contract has to be full-time.

A doctoral student must already hold a master's degree, and are typically employed by the university, or enjoy a similar grant, and will be called ''tohtorikoulutettava'' (doctoral candidate), ''tutkija'' (researcher) or ''assistentti'' (teaching assistant). Besides post-doctoral researchers (''tutkijatohtori'') and senior teaching assistants (''yliassistentti''), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions such as teaching researcher (''opettava tutkija''). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as e.g. ''erikoistutkija'' (\"special researcher\") or ''yliopistotutkija'' (university researcher). Docent (''dosentti'') is a non-professiorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (''professori'') are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there's no direct equivalent of an assistant / associate / full professor career path, although [[Aalto University]] is introducing these. Qualifications for a professor's position are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (''laitosjohtaja'' or ''osastonjohtaja'') and deans (head of faculty, ''dekaani''). The leader of a university is called a rector (''rehtori''), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (''vararehtori''). Vice-rectors may retain their professor's positions or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (''kansleri''), which works more with outreach and public relations than daily management.\n\n==France==\n{{main|Academic ranks in France}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!title| ||title|Faculty||title|Research-only||title|Teaching-only||title|Part-time\n|-\n!rowspan=2 title|Permanent positions||Professeur des universit\u00e9s ''or'' Directeur d'\u00e9tudes||Directeur de recherche|| ||Professeur des universit\u00e9s associ\u00e9\n|-\n!Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences||Charg\u00e9 de recherche||professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 ''or'' professeur certifi\u00e9||Ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences associ\u00e9\n|-\n!rowspan=2 title|Temporary positions||Attach\u00e9 temporaire d'enseignement et de recherches (<small>ATER</small>)||Post-doctorant||rowspan=2 colspan=2|Charg\u00e9 d'enseignement\n|-\n!Doctorant contractuel charg\u00e9 d'enseignement||Doctorant contractuel\n|}\n\nIn French business schools, ranks are the same as in the United States: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and finally (Full) Professor.\n\n==Germany==\n{{main|Academic ranks in Germany}}\n\n==Greece==\n* Professor Emeritus ({{Lang-el|\u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}} (male) / {{lang|el|\u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 or \u039f\u03bc\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1}} (female)). \u0391n honorary title for people at the rank of Professor who have reached the legal age for retirement; If they wish, they have the right, for a limited time after retirement, to continue their research projects. \n* Professor (\u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Associate Professor (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Assistant Professor (\u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (male) / \u0395\u03c0\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 (female)).\n* Lecturer (in universities and technical universities: \u039b\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 (both male and female) / in technological educational institutes: \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd (male) / \u039a\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03b3\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u0395\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd (female)). \u0399n universities and technical universities this academic rank existed only from 1982 to 2011, but people holding the rank remain as teaching staff until retirement.<ref>[http://www.mred.tuc.gr/p0141.htm \"Academic Ranks (in Greece)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916085305/http://www.mred.tuc.gr/p0141.htm |date=2006-09-16 }}; [http://www.posdep.gr/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=991&Itemid=438 \"Lecturers after Law 4009\"].</ref>\n* Laboratory Teaching Staff member ({{Lang-el|\u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0395\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u0394\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd (\u0395.\u0394\u0399.\u03a0.)}}).

The family contains about 1,600 described species worldwide, most diverse in arid and [[semiarid]] regions with sandy soils. The larvae are predators of insect larvae in soil.<ref>[[:de:Luchsfliegen|German Wikipedia: Luchsfliegen]]</ref>\n[[File:Europ\u00e4ischenZweifl\u00fcgeligen1790TafXXXVII.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Plate from [[Johann Wilhelm Meigen]] ''Europ\u00e4ischenZweifl\u00fcgeligen''.Showing the gross features mentioned in the text (figures 5-9)]]\n\n==Description==\nAdult Therevidae are small- to medium-sized with a body length of 2.4 to 18&nbsp;mm and a hairy integument. The coloration ranges from shades of yellow to black, but commonly the background colour is masked by the [[tomentum (anatomy)|tomentum]].\n\nThe compound eyes are generally larger in males, which in many species are actually [[Arthropod eye#Anatomical distribution of compound eyes|holoptic]]. Females have well-developed compound eyes, but are clearly [[Arthropod eye#Anatomical distribution of compound eyes|dichoptic]]. There are three ocelli. The antennae are relatively short. The scape is elongated, the pedicel very short, and the first [[Glossary of entomology terms|flagellomere]] is conical and elongated, the apex bearing a compound stylus with one to three segments. The [[Glossary of entomology terms|scape]] and pedicel are pubescent;\n\nIn contrast to the related and confusingly similar family [[Asilidae]], the [[Insect mouthparts|labium]] in the Therevidae is not a piercing, predatory organ, but ends in two fleshy [[Labellum (insect anatomy)|labella]] adapted to the sucking of liquid foods. Another difference is that, though Therevidae commonly have fluffy [[seta]]e above the mouthparts, the setae are not stiff bristles like the protective [[seta|chaetae]] comprising the [[Asilidae#Overview|mystax]] of most species of Asilidae. Furthermore, in the Asilidae the depression on the [[Insect morphology#Head|vertex]] between the eyes, tends to be more obvious than in the Therevidae.\n\nThe thorax is broad and moderately convex, with long bristles ([[macrotrichae]]). The legs are long and slender, with femora and tibiae bearing bristles; the tibiae are without apical spurs and the tarsi are provided with [[Glossary of entomology terms|empodia]] or without the median pretarsal. The wings are well developed, hyaline or opaque, often with pigmentation of the veins located at the termination of the transverse and longitudinal veins.\n\nThe abdomen is tapered and elongated, typically 3 to 4 times as long as its broadest width when not extended for activities such as oviposition. Eight abdominal segments ([[Glossary of entomology terms|uriti]]) are externally visible.\n\n[[Image:Therevidae wing veins.svg|thumb|230px|left|Diagram of wing veins. Longitudinal veins: C: costa; Sc: subcosta; R: radius; M: media; Cu: cubitus; A: anal. Crossveins: h: humeral; r-m: radio-medial; m-m: medial; m-cu: medio-cubital.Cells: d: discal; br: 1st basal; bm: 2nd basal; r1: marginal; r3: 1st submarginal; r4: 2nd submarginal; r5: 1st posterior; m1: 2nd posterior; m2: 3rd posterior; m3: 4th posterior; cup: cell cup]]\n\nThe [[Morphology of Diptera|wing venation]] is relatively complex but without a particular conformation to distinguish the Therevidae from other families of Asiloidea. The radius is divided into four branches, with R 2 +3 undivided. The branch R 4 is long and winding and reaches the costal margin, the branch R 5 terminates on the posterior border, so the second submarginal cell is open at the apex of the wing. The media is divided into four branches, all independent but with M 3 and M 4 convergent. The transverse medial vein closes the discal cell. This has an elongated shape and terminates at the apex with three angles from which the first three branches of media spring. The fourth branch, M 4 (or CuA 1 according to a different interpretation), originates from the apex of the posterior basal discal cell. The cubit and anal converge on a short common branch before reaching the apex.\n\nThe larva is [[Morphology of Diptera|apodous]] and [[Morphology of Diptera|eucephalic]], cylindrical, very long and thin, and with tapered ends. The integument is smooth, white, or pink. The head capsule is well developed, but narrower than the other regions.\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Therevidae-2014-09-05.webm|thumb|thumbtime=1:58|Oviposition of ''Thereva cincta'']]\nKnowledge of the biology of the Therevidae is limited and fragmented. The lifecycle is usually carried out in a single generation per year, although some European Therevidae have a cycle of two or more years. The overwintering stage is represented by the mature larva. The postembryonic development in known forms, five [[instars]] and pupation takes place in the spring.\n\nThe larvae, like those of other Asiloidea, have an entomophagous diet and they live as predators. They are generally found on dry, sandy soils and dry litter. Larvae also are located in other substrates such as decomposing organic matter and under the bark of trees. Among the prey are the larvae and pupae of Diptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The observation of the behaviour of known forms highlights voracious feeding and agile movements. When exposed to light, the larvae of the Therevidae dig back into the substrate with rapid movements.\n\nAdults feed mainly on nectar, honeydew, and pollen, but they occasionally feed on liquid secretions of animal or vegetable origin. They are found in various environments and can be found in streams, meadows, open woodlands, or, like many other Asiloidea, in dry and sandy places or on beaches. At rest, they choose various substrates according to the species: some species rest on the ground, others on rocks, vegetation, or intertidal debris. They are generally [[diurnality|diurnal]] and move in short, quick flights. Although inhabiting semiarid regions, or possibly for that very reason, since that is where prey for their larvae are likely to be plentiful, adults are particularly attracted to water, generally remaining near pools or other sources of moisture.\n\n==Systematics and phylogeny==\nThe family Therevidae is little known and it resembles other many other [[Brachycera]], both in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[ethology]]. The taxonomic history of the Therevidae accordingly has undergone repeated revisions; in the past, many therevids were assigned to other families, and many other Brachycera were assigned to the Therevidae. Since the 1970s however, there has been a great deal of rationalisation of the taxonomy, particularly by Lyneborg and Irwin. Revision of the higher taxa, based on the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] [[Cladistics|cladistic]] relationships between various groups of Asiloidea has led to a better understanding of their ranks and interrelationships.\n\nOriginally the Therevidae ''[[sensu]] lato'', were [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]]. It required the reassignment of some subfamilies to other families, together with adjustments to closely related families in the [[Asiloidea]], to establish consistent phylogenetic relationships. The Therevidae now constitute a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] clade that English-speaking dipterologists call the therevoid clade (clade of \"Terevoidi\"). This group has not been assigned a ranking at any taxonomic level above the rank of family, but for the present is recognised as a group of families within the superfamily Asiloidea.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tolweb.org/Brachycera/10500|title= Brian M.

After taxonomic revisions by Lyneborg (1976) and Winterston et al. (2001), the family is divided into four subfamilies, among which the most representative in size and diffusion is the Therevinae:\n\n*Agapophytinae: 12 genera\n*Phycinae: 13 genera\n*Therevinae: 84 genera\n*Xestomyzinae: 12 genera\n\nTo the 121 living genera are added extinct genera, dating back to the [[Cenozoic]], ''[[Dasystethos]]'' , ''[[Glaesorthactia]]'' , ''[[Kroeberiella]]'', and ''[[Palaeopherocera]]'', in doubt is  ''[[Helicorhaphe]]''\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThe habitat of the Therevidae is more varied than that of other Asiloidea, but as in Asiloidea, preferred ecosystems better suit the larvae, so these insects are more common in thickets of xerophilous plants ([[garrigue]] and [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], in deserts and on sandy beaches.\n\nThe Therevidae are represented in all zoogeographical regions of the Earth. The Therevinae are present in all continents,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} <!-- Antarctica? -->with a lower frequency in the eastern region . The Phycinae have spread to the [[Afrotropical ecozone|Afrotropical]] and the [[Holarctic]]. The Xestomyzinae are mainly Afrotropical. The Agapophytinae are [[endemic]] to the [[Australasia ecozone]].\n\nIn Europe, only the subfamilies are represented:- Phycinae , with two genera, and Therevinae , with 15 genera. A total of 98 species are reported, two-thirds of which belong to the genus ''Thereva''.\n\n==Species lists==\n*[http://www.faunaeur.org/full_results.php?id=10968 Palaearctic]\n*[http://www.nearctica.com/nomina/main.htm Nearctic]\n*[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/aocat/therevidae.html Australasian/Oceanian]\n*[http://konchudb.agr.agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mokuroku/ Japan]\n*[http://eol.org/pages/9027/overview World list]\n*[[List of soldierflies and allies of Great Britain]]\n\n==Identification==\n\nCole, F.R., 1923.

The family contains about 1,600 described species worldwide, most diverse in arid and [[semiarid]] regions with sandy soils. The larvae are predators of insect larvae in soil.<ref>[[:de:Luchsfliegen|German Wikipedia: Luchsfliegen]]</ref>\n[[File:Europ\u00e4ischenZweifl\u00fcgeligen1790TafXXXVII.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Plate from [[Johann Wilhelm Meigen]] ''Europ\u00e4ischenZweifl\u00fcgeligen''.Showing the gross features mentioned in the text (figures 5-9)]]\n\n==Description==\nAdult Therevidae are small- to medium-sized with a body length of 2.4 to 18&nbsp;mm and a hairy integument. The coloration ranges from shades of yellow to black, but commonly the background colour is masked by the [[tomentum (anatomy)|tomentum]].\n\nThe compound eyes are generally larger in males, which in many species are actually [[Arthropod eye#Anatomical distribution of compound eyes|holoptic]]. Females have well-developed compound eyes, but are clearly [[Arthropod eye#Anatomical distribution of compound eyes|dichoptic]]. There are three ocelli. The antennae are relatively short. The scape is elongated, the pedicel very short, and the first [[Glossary of entomology terms|flagellomere]] is conical and elongated, the apex bearing a compound stylus with one to three segments. The [[Glossary of entomology terms|scape]] and pedicel are pubescent;\n\nIn contrast to the related and confusingly similar family [[Asilidae]], the [[Insect mouthparts|labium]] in the Therevidae is not a piercing, predatory organ, but ends in two fleshy [[Labellum (insect anatomy)|labella]] adapted to the sucking of liquid foods. Another difference is that, though Therevidae commonly have fluffy [[seta]]e above the mouthparts, the setae are not stiff bristles like the protective [[seta|chaetae]] comprising the [[Asilidae#Overview|mystax]] of most species of Asilidae. Furthermore, in the Asilidae the depression on the [[Insect morphology#Head|vertex]] between the eyes, tends to be more obvious than in the Therevidae.\n\nThe thorax is broad and moderately convex, with long bristles ([[macrotrichae]]). The legs are long and slender, with femora and tibiae bearing bristles; the tibiae are without apical spurs and the tarsi are provided with [[Glossary of entomology terms|empodia]] or without the median pretarsal. The wings are well developed, hyaline or opaque, often with pigmentation of the veins located at the termination of the transverse and longitudinal veins.\n\nThe abdomen is tapered and elongated, typically 3 to 4 times as long as its broadest width when not extended for activities such as oviposition. Eight abdominal segments ([[Glossary of entomology terms|uriti]]) are externally visible.\n\n[[Image:Therevidae wing veins.svg|thumb|230px|left|Diagram of wing veins. Longitudinal veins: C: costa; Sc: subcosta; R: radius; M: media; Cu: cubitus; A: anal. Crossveins: h: humeral; r-m: radio-medial; m-m: medial; m-cu: medio-cubital.Cells: d: discal; br: 1st basal; bm: 2nd basal; r1: marginal; r3: 1st submarginal; r4: 2nd submarginal; r5: 1st posterior; m1: 2nd posterior; m2: 3rd posterior; m3: 4th posterior; cup: cell cup]]\n\nThe [[Morphology of Diptera|wing venation]] is relatively complex but without a particular conformation to distinguish the Therevidae from other families of Asiloidea. The radius is divided into four branches, with R 2 +3 undivided. The branch R 4 is long and winding and reaches the costal margin, the branch R 5 terminates on the posterior border, so the second submarginal cell is open at the apex of the wing. The media is divided into four branches, all independent but with M 3 and M 4 convergent. The transverse medial vein closes the discal cell. This has an elongated shape and terminates at the apex with three angles from which the first three branches of media spring. The fourth branch, M 4 (or CuA 1 according to a different interpretation), originates from the apex of the posterior basal discal cell. The cubit and anal converge on a short common branch before reaching the apex.\n\nThe larva is [[Morphology of Diptera|apodous]] and [[Morphology of Diptera|eucephalic]], cylindrical, very long and thin, and with tapered ends. The integument is smooth, white, or pink. The head capsule is well developed, but narrower than the other regions.\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Therevidae-2014-09-05.webm|thumb|thumbtime=1:58|Oviposition of ''Thereva cincta'']]\nKnowledge of the biology of the Therevidae is limited and fragmented. The lifecycle is usually carried out in a single generation per year, although some European Therevidae have a cycle of two or more years. The overwintering stage is represented by the mature larva. The postembryonic development in known forms, five [[instars]] and pupation takes place in the spring.\n\nThe larvae, like those of other Asiloidea, have an entomophagous diet and they live as predators. They are generally found on dry, sandy soils and dry litter. Larvae also are located in other substrates such as decomposing organic matter and under the bark of trees. Among the prey are the larvae and pupae of Diptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The observation of the behaviour of known forms highlights voracious feeding and agile movements. When exposed to light, the larvae of the Therevidae dig back into the substrate with rapid movements.\n\nAdults feed mainly on nectar, honeydew, and pollen, but they occasionally feed on liquid secretions of animal or vegetable origin. They are found in various environments and can be found in streams, meadows, open woodlands, or, like many other Asiloidea, in dry and sandy places or on beaches. At rest, they choose various substrates according to the species: some species rest on the ground, others on rocks, vegetation, or intertidal debris. They are generally [[diurnality|diurnal]] and move in short, quick flights. Although inhabiting semiarid regions, or possibly for that very reason, since that is where prey for their larvae are likely to be plentiful, adults are particularly attracted to water, generally remaining near pools or other sources of moisture.\n\n==Systematics and phylogeny==\nThe family Therevidae is little known and it resembles other many other [[Brachycera]], both in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[ethology]]. The taxonomic history of the Therevidae accordingly has undergone repeated revisions; in the past, many therevids were assigned to other families, and many other Brachycera were assigned to the Therevidae. Since the 1970s however, there has been a great deal of rationalisation of the taxonomy, particularly by Lyneborg and Irwin. Revision of the higher taxa, based on the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] [[Cladistics|cladistic]] relationships between various groups of Asiloidea has led to a better understanding of their ranks and interrelationships.\n\nOriginally the Therevidae ''[[sensu]] lato'', were [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]]. It required the reassignment of some subfamilies to other families, together with adjustments to closely related families in the [[Asiloidea]], to establish consistent phylogenetic relationships. The Therevidae now constitute a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] clade that English-speaking dipterologists call the therevoid clade (clade of \"Terevoidi\"). This group has not been assigned a ranking at any taxonomic level above the rank of family, but for the present is recognised as a group of families within the superfamily Asiloidea.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tolweb.org/Brachycera/10500|title= Brian M.

After taxonomic revisions by Lyneborg (1976) and Winterston et al. (2001), the family is divided into four subfamilies, among which the most representative in size and diffusion is the Therevinae:\n\n*Agapophytinae: 12 genera\n*Phycinae: 13 genera\n*Therevinae: 84 genera\n*Xestomyzinae: 12 genera\n\nTo the 121 living genera are added extinct genera, dating back to the [[Cenozoic]], ''[[Dasystethos]]'' , ''[[Glaesorthactia]]'' , ''[[Kroeberiella]]'', and ''[[Palaeopherocera]]'', in doubt is  ''[[Helicorhaphe]]''\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\nThe habitat of the Therevidae is more varied than that of other Asiloidea, but as in Asiloidea, preferred ecosystems better suit the larvae, so these insects are more common in thickets of xerophilous plants ([[garrigue]] and [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], in deserts and on sandy beaches.\n\nThe Therevidae are represented in all zoogeographical regions of the Earth. The Therevinae are present in all continents,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} <!-- Antarctica? -->with a lower frequency in the eastern region . The Phycinae have spread to the [[Afrotropical ecozone|Afrotropical]] and the [[Holarctic]]. The Xestomyzinae are mainly Afrotropical. The Agapophytinae are [[endemic]] to the [[Australasia ecozone]].\n\nIn Europe, only the subfamilies are represented:- Phycinae , with two genera, and Therevinae , with 15 genera. A total of 98 species are reported, two-thirds of which belong to the genus ''Thereva''.\n\n==Species lists==\n*[http://www.faunaeur.org/full_results.php?id=10968 Palaearctic]\n*[http://www.nearctica.com/nomina/main.htm Nearctic]\n*[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/aocat/therevidae.html Australasian/Oceanian]\n*[http://konchudb.agr.agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mokuroku/ Japan]\n*[http://eol.org/pages/9027/overview World list]\n*[[List of soldierflies and allies of Great Britain]]\n\n==Identification==\n\nCole, F.R., 1923.

Prices are taken from the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] trading venue. According to [[Deutsche B\u00f6rse]], the operator of [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]], DAX measures the performance of the [[Prime Standard]]\u2019s 30 largest German companies in terms of order book volume and market capitalization.<ref>[http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/private_investors/20_Equities/20_Indices/10_DAX?module=InOverview_Index&wp=DE0008469008&wplist=DE0008469008&foldertype=_Index DAX]</ref> It is the equivalent of the [[FT 30]] and the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], and because of its small selection it does not necessarily represent the vitality of the economy as whole.\n\nThe L-DAX Index is an indicator of the German benchmark DAX index's performance after the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] trading venue closes based on the [[floor trading]] at the B\u00f6rse Frankfurt trading venue. The L-DAX Index basis is the \"floor\" trade (''Parketthandel'') at the Frankfurt stock exchange; it is computed daily between 08:00 and 17:45 Hours CET. The L/E-DAX index (Late/Early DAX) is calculated from 17:45 to 20:00 CET and from 08:00 to 09:00 CET. The [[Eurex]], a European electronic futures and options exchange based in [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]] with a subsidiary in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, offers options (ODAX) and Futures (FDAX) on the DAX from 08:00 to 22:00 CET.\n\nThe Base date for the DAX is 30 December 1987, and it was started from a base value of 1,000. The [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] technology calculates the index every 1 second since 1 January 2006.\n\n== Versions ==\nThe DAX has two versions, called performance index and price index, depending on whether dividends are counted. The performance index, which measures [[total return]], is the more commonly quoted, however the price index is more similar to commonly quoted indexes in other countries. There are two versions of futures contract available: FDAX (\u20ac25 per point) and FDXM (otherwise known as FDAX mini at \u20ac5 per point).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedaxtrader.co.uk/the-german-dax/|title=TheDaxTrader - The German Dax details|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711202912/https://thedaxtrader.co.uk/the-german-dax/|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Price history==\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the performance index first closed above 12,000.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/340af600-cbfa-11e4-beca-00144feab7de.html Dax breaks 12,000 barrier - FT.com]</ref> On April 10, 2015, the price index first closed above its closing high from 2000.\n\n==Record values==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"1\"|Category\n! colspan=\"2\"|All-time highs\n|-\n| Closing || 13,783.89 || Monday, February 17, 2020\n|-\n| Intraday || 13,795.24 || Monday, February 17, 2020\n|}\n\n== Annual returns ==\nThe following table shows the annual development of the DAX, calculated retroactively up to 1950.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019034637/http://tool.boerse.de/DAX-Indizes-846900-kurshistorie/|title=Index DAX (846900) {{!}} Indexstand {{!}} B\u00f6rsenkurs {{!}} Kurs {{!}} Tool - boerse.de|date=2010-10-19|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dax-indices.com/de/web/dax-indices/index-details?isin=DE0008469008|title=DAX Digital {{!}} DAX\u00ae (TR) EUR|last=DAX|website=dax-indices.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n!Year\n!Closing level\n!Change in Index<br />in Points\n!Change in Index<br />in %\n|-\n| 1950 || 30.18 || \u22122.42 || \u22127.42\n|-\n| 1951 || 65.01 || 34.83 || 115.41\n|-\n| 1952 || 59.75 || \u22125.26 || \u22128.09\n|-\n| 1953 || 74.09 || 14.34 || 24.00\n|-\n| 1954 || 135.28 || 61.19 || 82.59\n|-\n| 1955 || 148.81 || 13.53 || 10.00\n|-\n| 1956 || 137.80 || \u221211.01 || \u22127.40\n|-\n| 1957 || 144.97 || 7.17 || 5.20\n|-\n| 1958 || 232.23 || 87.26 || 60.19\n|-\n| 1959 || 417.79 || 185.56 || 79.90\n|-\n| 1960 || 534.09 || 116.30 || 27.84\n|-\n| 1961 || 489.79 || \u221244.30 || \u22128.29\n|-\n| 1962 || 386.32 || \u2212103.47 || \u221221.13\n|-\n| 1963 || 438.95 || 52.63 || 13.62\n|-\n| 1964 || 477.89 || 38.94 || 8.87\n|-\n| 1965 || 422.36 || \u221255.53 || \u221211.62\n|-\n| 1966 || 333.36 || \u221289.00 || \u221221.07\n|-\n| 1967 || 503.22 || 169.86 || 50.95\n|-\n| 1968 || 555.62 || 52.40 || 10.41\n|-\n| 1969 || 622.38 || 66.76 || 12.02\n|-\n| 1970 || 443.86 || \u2212178.52 || \u221228.68\n|-\n| 1971 || 473.46 || 29.60 || 6.67\n|-\n| 1972 || 536.36 || 62.90 || 13.29\n|-\n| 1973 || 403.88 || \u2212132.48 || \u221224.70\n|-\n| 1974 || 401.79 || \u22122.09 || \u22120.52\n|-\n| 1975 || 563.25 || 161.46 || 40.19\n|-\n| 1976 || 509.02 || \u221254.23 || \u22129.63\n|-\n| 1977 || 549.34 || 40.32 || 7.92\n|-\n| 1978 || 575.15 || 25.81 || 4.70\n|-\n| 1979 || 497.79 || \u221277.36 || \u221213.45\n|-\n| 1980 || 480.92 || \u221216.87 || \u22123.39\n|-\n| 1981 || 490.39 || 9.47 || 1.97\n|-\n| 1982 || 552.77 || 62.38 || 12.72\n|-\n| 1983 || 773.95 || 221.18 || 40.01\n|-\n| 1984 || 820.91 || 46.96 || 6.07\n|-\n| 1985 || 1,366.23 || 545.32 || 66.43\n|-\n| 1986 || 1,432.25 || 66.02 || 4.83\n|-\n| '''1987''' || '''1,000.00''' || \u2212432.25 || \u221230.18\n|-\n| 1988 || 1,327.87 || 327.87 || 32.79\n|-\n| 1989 || 1,790.37 || 462.50 || 34.83\n|-\n| 1990 || 1,398.23 || \u2212392.14 || \u221221.90\n|-\n| 1991 || 1,577.98 || 179.75 || 12.86\n|-\n| 1992 || 1,545.05 || \u221232.93 || \u22122.09\n|-\n| 1993 || 2,266.68 || 721.63 || 46.71\n|-\n| 1994 || 2,106.58 || \u2212160.10 || \u22127.06\n|-\n| 1995 || 2,253.88 || 147.30 || 6.99\n|-\n| 1996 || 2,888.69 || 634.81 || 28.17\n|-\n| 1997 || 4,249.69 || 1,361.00 || 47.11\n|-\n| 1998 || 5,002.39 || 752.70 || 17.71\n|-\n| 1999 || 6,958.14 || 1,955.75 || 39.10\n|-\n| 2000 || 6,433.61 || \u2212524.53 || \u22127.54\n|-\n| 2001 || 5,160.10 || \u22121,273.51 || \u221219.79\n|-\n| 2002 || 2,892.63 || \u22122,267.47 || \u221243.94\n|-\n| 2003 || 3,965.16 || 1,072.53 || 37.08\n|-\n| 2004 || 4,256.08 || 290.92 || 7.34\n|-\n| 2005 || 5,408.26 || 1,152.18 || 27.07\n|-\n| 2006 || 6,596.92 || 1,188.66 || 21.98\n|-\n| 2007 || 8,067.32 || 1,470.40 || 22.29\n|-\n| 2008 || 4,810.20 || \u22123,257.12 || \u221240.37\n|-\n| 2009 || 5,957.43 || 1,147.23 || 23.85\n|-\n| 2010 || 6,914.19 || 956.76 || 16.06\n|-\n| 2011 || 5,898.35 || \u22121,015.84 || \u221214.69\n|-\n| 2012 || 7,612.39 || 1,714.04 || 29.06\n|-\n| 2013 || 9,552.16 || 1,939.77 || 24.77\n|-\n| 2014 || 9,805.55 || 253.39 || 2.65\n|-\n| 2015 || 10,743.01 || 937.46 || 9.56\n|-\n| 2016 || 11,481.06 || 738.05 || 6.87\n|-\n| 2017 || 12,917.64 || 1,436.58 || 12.51\n|-\n| 2018 || 10,558.96 || \u22122,358.68 || \u221218.26\n|-\n|2019\n|13,249.01\n|2,690.05\n|25.48\n|}\n\n== Components ==\nBelow is the list of companies which are a component of the DAX 30, as of 2019.

Prices are taken from the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] trading venue. According to [[Deutsche B\u00f6rse]], the operator of [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]], DAX measures the performance of the [[Prime Standard]]\u2019s 30 largest German companies in terms of order book volume and market capitalization.<ref>[http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/private_investors/20_Equities/20_Indices/10_DAX?module=InOverview_Index&wp=DE0008469008&wplist=DE0008469008&foldertype=_Index DAX]</ref> It is the equivalent of the [[FT 30]] and the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], and because of its small selection it does not necessarily represent the vitality of the economy as whole.\n\nThe L-DAX Index is an indicator of the German benchmark DAX index's performance after the [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] trading venue closes based on the [[floor trading]] at the B\u00f6rse Frankfurt trading venue. The L-DAX Index basis is the \"floor\" trade (''Parketthandel'') at the Frankfurt stock exchange; it is computed daily between 08:00 and 17:45 Hours CET. The L/E-DAX index (Late/Early DAX) is calculated from 17:45 to 20:00 CET and from 08:00 to 09:00 CET. The [[Eurex]], a European electronic futures and options exchange based in [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Switzerland]] with a subsidiary in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, offers options (ODAX) and Futures (FDAX) on the DAX from 08:00 to 22:00 CET.\n\nThe Base date for the DAX is 30 December 1987, and it was started from a base value of 1,000. The [[Xetra (trading system)|Xetra]] technology calculates the index every 1 second since 1 January 2006.\n\n== Versions ==\nThe DAX has two versions, called performance index and price index, depending on whether dividends are counted. The performance index, which measures [[total return]], is the more commonly quoted, however the price index is more similar to commonly quoted indexes in other countries. There are two versions of futures contract available: FDAX (\u20ac25 per point) and FDXM (otherwise known as FDAX mini at \u20ac5 per point).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedaxtrader.co.uk/the-german-dax/|title=TheDaxTrader - The German Dax details|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711202912/https://thedaxtrader.co.uk/the-german-dax/|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Price history==\n\nOn March 16, 2015, the performance index first closed above 12,000.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/340af600-cbfa-11e4-beca-00144feab7de.html Dax breaks 12,000 barrier - FT.com]</ref> On April 10, 2015, the price index first closed above its closing high from 2000.\n\n==Record values==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"1\"|Category\n! colspan=\"2\"|All-time highs\n|-\n| Closing || 13,783.89 || Monday, February 17, 2020\n|-\n| Intraday || 13,795.24 || Monday, February 17, 2020\n|}\n\n== Annual Returns ==\nThe following table shows the annual development of the DAX, calculated retroactively up to 1950.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019034637/http://tool.boerse.de/DAX-Indizes-846900-kurshistorie/|title=Index DAX (846900) {{!}} Indexstand {{!}} B\u00f6rsenkurs {{!}} Kurs {{!}} Tool - boerse.de|date=2010-10-19|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dax-indices.com/de/web/dax-indices/index-details?isin=DE0008469008|title=DAX Digital {{!}} DAX\u00ae (TR) EUR|last=DAX|website=dax-indices.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n!Year\n!Closing level\n!Change in Index<br />in Points\n!Change in Index<br />in %\n|-\n| 1950 || 30.18 || \u22122.42 || \u22127.42\n|-\n| 1951 || 65.01 || 34.83 || 115.41\n|-\n| 1952 || 59.75 || \u22125.26 || \u22128.09\n|-\n| 1953 || 74.09 || 14.34 || 24.00\n|-\n| 1954 || 135.28 || 61.19 || 82.59\n|-\n| 1955 || 148.81 || 13.53 || 10.00\n|-\n| 1956 || 137.80 || \u221211.01 || \u22127.40\n|-\n| 1957 || 144.97 || 7.17 || 5.20\n|-\n| 1958 || 232.23 || 87.26 || 60.19\n|-\n| 1959 || 417.79 || 185.56 || 79.90\n|-\n| 1960 || 534.09 || 116.30 || 27.84\n|-\n| 1961 || 489.79 || \u221244.30 || \u22128.29\n|-\n| 1962 || 386.32 || \u2212103.47 || \u221221.13\n|-\n| 1963 || 438.95 || 52.63 || 13.62\n|-\n| 1964 || 477.89 || 38.94 || 8.87\n|-\n| 1965 || 422.36 || \u221255.53 || \u221211.62\n|-\n| 1966 || 333.36 || \u221289.00 || \u221221.07\n|-\n| 1967 || 503.22 || 169.86 || 50.95\n|-\n| 1968 || 555.62 || 52.40 || 10.41\n|-\n| 1969 || 622.38 || 66.76 || 12.02\n|-\n| 1970 || 443.86 || \u2212178.52 || \u221228.68\n|-\n| 1971 || 473.46 || 29.60 || 6.67\n|-\n| 1972 || 536.36 || 62.90 || 13.29\n|-\n| 1973 || 403.88 || \u2212132.48 || \u221224.70\n|-\n| 1974 || 401.79 || \u22122.09 || \u22120.52\n|-\n| 1975 || 563.25 || 161.46 || 40.19\n|-\n| 1976 || 509.02 || \u221254.23 || \u22129.63\n|-\n| 1977 || 549.34 || 40.32 || 7.92\n|-\n| 1978 || 575.15 || 25.81 || 4.70\n|-\n| 1979 || 497.79 || \u221277.36 || \u221213.45\n|-\n| 1980 || 480.92 || \u221216.87 || \u22123.39\n|-\n| 1981 || 490.39 || 9.47 || 1.97\n|-\n| 1982 || 552.77 || 62.38 || 12.72\n|-\n| 1983 || 773.95 || 221.18 || 40.01\n|-\n| 1984 || 820.91 || 46.96 || 6.07\n|-\n| 1985 || 1,366.23 || 545.32 || 66.43\n|-\n| 1986 || 1,432.25 || 66.02 || 4.83\n|-\n| '''1987''' || '''1,000.00''' || \u2212432.25 || \u221230.18\n|-\n| 1988 || 1,327.87 || 327.87 || 32.79\n|-\n| 1989 || 1,790.37 || 462.50 || 34.83\n|-\n| 1990 || 1,398.23 || \u2212392.14 || \u221221.90\n|-\n| 1991 || 1,577.98 || 179.75 || 12.86\n|-\n| 1992 || 1,545.05 || \u221232.93 || \u22122.09\n|-\n| 1993 || 2,266.68 || 721.63 || 46.71\n|-\n| 1994 || 2,106.58 || \u2212160.10 || \u22127.06\n|-\n| 1995 || 2,253.88 || 147.30 || 6.99\n|-\n| 1996 || 2,888.69 || 634.81 || 28.17\n|-\n| 1997 || 4,249.69 || 1,361.00 || 47.11\n|-\n| 1998 || 5,002.39 || 752.70 || 17.71\n|-\n| 1999 || 6,958.14 || 1,955.75 || 39.10\n|-\n| 2000 || 6,433.61 || \u2212524.53 || \u22127.54\n|-\n| 2001 || 5,160.10 || \u22121,273.51 || \u221219.79\n|-\n| 2002 || 2,892.63 || \u22122,267.47 || \u221243.94\n|-\n| 2003 || 3,965.16 || 1,072.53 || 37.08\n|-\n| 2004 || 4,256.08 || 290.92 || 7.34\n|-\n| 2005 || 5,408.26 || 1,152.18 || 27.07\n|-\n| 2006 || 6,596.92 || 1,188.66 || 21.98\n|-\n| 2007 || 8,067.32 || 1,470.40 || 22.29\n|-\n| 2008 || 4,810.20 || \u22123,257.12 || \u221240.37\n|-\n| 2009 || 5,957.43 || 1,147.23 || 23.85\n|-\n| 2010 || 6,914.19 || 956.76 || 16.06\n|-\n| 2011 || 5,898.35 || \u22121,015.84 || \u221214.69\n|-\n| 2012 || 7,612.39 || 1,714.04 || 29.06\n|-\n| 2013 || 9,552.16 || 1,939.77 || 24.77\n|-\n| 2014 || 9,805.55 || 253.39 || 2.65\n|-\n| 2015 || 10,743.01 || 937.46 || 9.56\n|-\n| 2016 || 11,481.06 || 738.05 || 6.87\n|-\n| 2017 || 12,917.64 || 1,436.58 || 12.51\n|-\n| 2018 || 10,558.96 || \u22122,358.68 || \u221218.26\n|-\n|2019\n|13,249.01\n|2,690.05\n|25.48\n|}\n\n== Components ==\nBelow is the list of companies which are a component of the DAX 30, as of 2019.

Originally, the college was established under Institute of Road and Transport by the [[Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation]].\n\n==History==\nOn the suggestion of Lord Willington (then Viceroy of India) in 1930 a district committee to combat tuberculosis was formed in Coimbatore and the decision to start a tuberculosis sanatorium in Perundurai was made. The foundation stone was laid by Sir K.V.Reddy Naidu on 1 July 1936. The sanatorium was declared open by Sri.C.Rajagopalachari. It was  renamed Ramalingam Tuberculosis Sanatorium in 1952. In 1986 the government of Tamil Nadu attached a medical college with the sanatorium. The college has 600 beds and started functioning in 1992. In 2004, doctors' quarters were added. In 2017, the strength of the Medical College was increased from 60 students to 100 students. A school of nursing was started in 2008. \nGraduation day ceremony ([https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=ul09SpdPf14 VIDAI 2018]) for 2012 batch students (Dravagonz) was conducted in the newly built auditorium on 25 April 2018. The chief guests were 1. The Honourable Vice-chancellor of Tamilnadu Dr.MGR Medical University, Dr. S.Geethalakshmi MD PHD; and 2. The Honourable Erode district collector, Dr. S.Prabakar IAS.
