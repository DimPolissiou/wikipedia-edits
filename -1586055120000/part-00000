It has the [[Bayer designation]] '''\u03b1 Lyrae''', which is [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha Lyrae''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Lyr''' or '''\u03b1 Lyr'''. This star is [[List of star systems within 25\u201330 light-years|relatively close]] at only 25 [[light-year]]s from the [[Sun]], and, together with [[Arcturus]] and [[Sirius]], one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. It is the [[list of brightest stars|fifth-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], and the second-brightest star in the [[Northern Celestial Hemisphere|northern celestial hemisphere]], after Arcturus.\n\nVega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed \u201carguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun\u201d.<ref name=apj429_2_L81/> Vega was the [[North Star|northern]] [[pole star]] around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727, when the declination will be +86\u00b014'.<ref name=stellarium/> Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be [[Astrophotography|photographed]] and the first to have its [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] recorded.<ref name=barger_white2000/><ref name=paps24_166/> It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through [[parallax]] measurements. Vega has functioned as the baseline for calibrating the [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] brightness scale and was one of the stars used to define the [[Zero Point (photometry)|zero point]] for the [[UBV photometric system]].\n\nVega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive, its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher [[atomic number]] than that of [[helium]].<ref name=aaa391_3_1039/> Vega is also a [[variable star]] that varies slightly in brightness. It is [[stellar rotation|rotating]] rapidly with a velocity of 236&nbsp;km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's [[photosphere]] that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.<ref name=nature440_7086_896/>\n\nBased on an observed excess emission of [[infrared]] radiation, Vega appears to have a [[circumstellar disk]] of [[Cosmic dust|dust]]. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting [[debris disk]], which is analogous to the [[Kuiper belt]] in the [[Solar System]].<ref name=apj628_1_487/> Stars that display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.<ref name=apj124_1_514/>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\n''\u03b1 Lyrae'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Alpha Lyrae'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]]. The traditional name ''Vega'' (earlier ''Wega''<ref name=allen1963/>) comes from a loose transliteration of the [[Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|w\u0101qi\u2018}}'' meaning \"falling\" or \"landing\", via the phrase ''{{transl|ar|an-nasr al-w\u0101qi\u2018}}'', \"the falling eagle\".<ref name=glasse2008/> In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\"/> to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016<ref name=\"WGSN1\"/> included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included ''Vega'' for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/>\n\n==Observation==\n[[Image:Summer triangle.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Summer Triangle]]]]\nVega can often be seen near the [[zenith]] in the mid-northern [[latitude]]s during the evening in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] summer.<ref name=pasachoff2000/> From mid-southern latitudes, it can be seen low above the northern horizon during the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter. With a [[declination]] of +38.78\u00b0, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of [[51st parallel south|51\u00b0 S]]. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in [[Antarctica]] or in the southernmost part of South America, including [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]] (53\u00b0 S). At latitudes to the north of +51\u00b0 N, Vega remains continuously above the horizon as a [[circumpolar star]]. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight [[culmination]] when it crosses the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] at that time.<ref name=burnham1978/>\n\n[[File:Precession N.gif|thumb|The path of the north celestial pole among the stars due to the precession. Vega is the bright star near the bottom|alt=Small white disks representing the northern stars on a black background, overlaid by a circle showing the position of the north pole over time]]\nEach night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a [[pole star]]. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the [[Precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]]. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770&nbsp;years,<ref name=chaikin1990/> during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the [[celestial sphere]] that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is [[Polaris]], but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000.<ref name=roy_clarke2003/> Vega is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.<ref name=\"allen1963\" />\n\nThis star lies at a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of a widely spaced [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] called the [[Summer Triangle]], which consists of Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars [[Altair]], in [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], and [[Deneb]] in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].<ref name=pasachoff2000/> This formation is the approximate shape of a [[right triangle]], with Vega located at its [[right angle]]. The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.<ref name=upgren1998/>\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:Vega by Stephen Rahn.jpg|thumb|Astrophoto of Vega]]\n[[Astrophotography]], the [[photography]] of celestial objects, began in 1840 when [[John William Draper]] took an image of the [[Moon]] using the [[daguerreotype]] process. On July 17, 1850, Vega became the first star (other than the Sun) to be photographed, when it was imaged by [[William Cranch Bond|William Bond]] and [[John Adams Whipple]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], also with a daguerreotype.<ref name=allen1963/><ref name=barger_white2000/><ref name=pasp2_10_249/> [[Henry Draper]] took the first photograph of a star's [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega, and he also became the first person to show [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of a star.<ref name=paps24_166/> Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun.<ref name=aip/> In 1879, [[William Huggins]] used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve \"very strong lines\" that were common to this stellar category. These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen [[Balmer series]].<ref name=klaus2002/> Since 1943, the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.<ref name=baas25_1319/>\n\nThe distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the [[Earth]] orbits the Sun. The first person to publish a star's parallax was [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve|Friedrich G. W. von Struve]], when he announced a value of 0.125&nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] (0.125\u2033) for Vega.<ref name=berry1899/> [[Friedrich Bessel]] was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314\u2033 for the star system [[61 Cygni]], Struve revised his value for Vega's parallax to nearly double the original estimate. This change cast further doubt on Struve's data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result. However, Struve's initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129\u2033,<ref name=debarbat1988/><ref name=astroprof/> as determined by the [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/><ref name=aaa323_L49/><ref name=GSM/>\n\nThe brightness of a star, as seen from Earth, is measured with a standardized, [[logarithmic scale]]. This [[apparent magnitude]] is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest in the night sky, [[Sirius]], is of magnitude \u22121.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] brightness scales.<ref name=garfinkle1997/> However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified [[flux]]. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration and varies in brightness.<ref name=ajss45_83/>\n\nThe [[UBV photometric system]] measures the magnitude of stars through [[ultraviolet]], blue, and yellow filters, producing ''U'', ''B'', and ''V'' values, respectively. Vega is one of six [[A-type main-sequence star|A0V stars]] that were used to set the initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in the 1950s. The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as: {{nowrap|''U'' \u2212 ''B''}} = {{nowrap|''B'' \u2212 ''V''}} =&nbsp;0. In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref name=apj117_313/> Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region\u2014wavelength range 350\u2013850 [[nanometer]]s, most of which can be seen with the human eye\u2014so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000\u20134000&nbsp;[[Jansky|Jy]].<ref name=eso20020306/> However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the [[infrared]], and is near 100 Jy at 5&nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometers]].<ref name=mcmahon2005/>\n\nPhotometric measurements of Vega during the 1930s appeared to show that the star had a low-magnitude variability on the order of \u00b10.03 magnitudes (around \u00b12.8%<ref group=note name=deltaLum/> luminosity). This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega's variability has been controversial. The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the [[David Dunlap Observatory]] and showed some slight variability. Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a [[Delta Scuti variable]].<ref name=asp93_2_333/> This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.<ref name=araa33_1_75/> Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation. Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement.<ref name=merezhin/><ref name=hayes1984/> However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that \"A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1-2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean\".<ref name=gray2007/> Also, a 2011 article affirms that \"The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed\".<ref name=butkovskaya2011/>\n\nVega became the first solitary [[main-sequence star]] beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an [[Aerobee]] 350 from the [[White Sands Missile Range]].<ref name=apj229_661/> In 1983, Vega became the first star found to have a disk of dust. The [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.<ref name=nature307_5950_441/>\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nVega's [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] is A0V, making it a blue-tinged white [[main sequence]] star that is [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] in its core. Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega's main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, a tenth of the Sun's.<ref name=ajss40_733/> The current age of this star is about 455&nbsp;million years,<ref name=apj708_1_71/> or up to about half its expected total main-sequence lifespan. After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M [[red giant]] and shed much of its mass, finally becoming a [[white dwarf]]. At present, Vega has more than twice the mass<ref name=nature440_7086_896/> of the Sun and its [[bolometric luminosity]] is about 40 times the Sun's. Because it is rapidly-rotating and seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity, calculated assuming it was the same brightness all over, is about 57 times the Sun's.<ref name=apj645_1_664/> If Vega is variable, then it may be a [[Delta Scuti variable|Delta Scuti type]] with a period of about 0.107&nbsp;days.<ref name=asp93_2_333/>\n\nMost of the energy produced at Vega's core is generated by the carbon&ndash;nitrogen&ndash;oxygen cycle ([[CNO cycle]]), a [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|nuclear fusion]] process that combines [[proton]]s to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process becomes dominant at a temperature of about 17&nbsp;million&nbsp;K,<ref name=salaris_cassisi2005/> which is slightly higher than the core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's [[proton-proton chain reaction]] fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a [[convection zone]] about the core<ref name=apj601_1_512/> that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in [[Radiative transfer|radiative equilibrium]]. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a [[radiation zone]] centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.<ref name=padmanabhan2002/>\n\nThe energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources. At 5480&nbsp;\u00c5, the flux density is 3,650&nbsp;[[Jansky|Jy]] with an error margin of 2%.<ref name=apj161_1015/> The visual spectrum of Vega is dominated by [[absorption line]]s of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] with the [[electron]] at the n=2 [[principal quantum number]].<ref name=richmond/><ref name=clayton1983/> The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[chromium]].<ref name=mnras197_57/> The [[X-ray]] emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the [[stellar corona|corona]] for this star must be very weak or non-existent.<ref name=aaa318_215/> However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar [[coronal hole]] may be present,<ref name=apj229_661/><ref name=sao389/> confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted along the line of sight.<ref name=sao389/><ref name=apj213_5_874/>\n\nUsing [[spectropolarimetry]], a [[magnetic field]] has been detected on the surface of Vega by a team of astronomers at the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Observatoire du Pic du Midi]]. This is the first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class A star that is not an [[Ap and Bp star|Ap]] [[chemically peculiar star]]. The average line of sight component of this field has a strength of {{nowrap|\u22120.6 \u00b1 0.3 [[Gauss (unit)|G]]}}.<ref name=aaa500_3_L41/> This is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun.<ref name=sd20090726/> Magnetic fields of roughly 30 gauss have been reported for Vega, compared to about 1 gauss for the Sun.<ref name=apj229_661/> In 2015, bright [[star spot]]s were detected on the star's surface\u2014the first such detection for a normal A-type star, and these features show evidence of [[rotational modulation]] with a period of 0.68&nbsp;days.<ref name=aa577_A64/>\n\n===Rotation===\nWhen the radius of Vega was measured to high accuracy with an [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometer]], it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of {{nowrap|2.73 \u00b1 0.01}} times the [[solar radius|radius of the Sun]]. This is 60% larger than the radius of the star Sirius, while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12% larger. However, this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from the direction of its pole of rotation. Observations by the [[CHARA array]] in 2005\u201306 confirmed this deduction.<ref name=apj645_1_664/>\n\n[[Image:Size Vega.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Size comparison of Vega (left) to the Sun (right)]]\nThe pole of Vega\u2014its axis of rotation\u2014is inclined no more than five degrees from the line-of-sight to the Earth. At the high end of estimates for the [[stellar rotation|rotation]] velocity for Vega is {{nowrap|236.2 \u00b1 3.7 km/s}}<ref name=apj708_1_71/> along the equator, much higher than the observed (i.e. [[projected rotational velocity|projected]]) rotational velocity because Vega is seen almost pole-on. This is 88% of the speed that would cause the star to start breaking up from [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] effects.<ref name=apj708_1_71/> This rapid rotation of Vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge, so the radius of the equator is 19% larger than the polar radius. (The estimated polar radius of this star is {{nowrap|2.362 \u00b1 0.012 }}[[solar radius|solar radii]], while the equatorial radius is {{nowrap|2.818 \u00b1 0.013}} solar radii.<ref name=apj708_1_71/>) From the Earth, this bulge is being viewed from the direction of its pole, producing the overly large radius estimate.\n\nThe local [[surface gravity]] at the poles is greater than at the equator, which produces a variation in [[effective temperature]] over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], while the equatorial temperature is about 8,152&nbsp;K.<ref name=apj708_1_71/>  This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong [[gravity darkening]] effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower-intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star.  The temperature gradient may also mean that Vega has a convection zone around the equator,<ref name=apj645_1_664/><ref name=noao2006/> while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure [[Radiation zone|radiative equilibrium]].<ref name=adelman2004/>  By the [[Von Zeipel theorem]], the local luminosity is higher at the poles.  As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its [[equator]] instead of almost pole-on, then its overall brightness would be lower.\n\nAs Vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow improved instrument calibrations.<ref name=science317_5836_325/>\n\n===Element abundance===\nIn astronomy, those elements with higher [[atomic number]]s than helium are termed \"metals\". The [[metallicity]] of Vega's [[photosphere]] is only about 32% of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun's atmosphere.<ref group=note name=metal/> (Compare this, for example, to a threefold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun.) For comparison, the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about Z<sub>Sol</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0172&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;0.002.<ref name=apj644_2_1291/> Thus, in terms of abundances, only about 0.54% of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium.\n\nThe unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak [[Lambda Bo\u00f6tis star]].<ref name=bicds38_137/><ref name=apj548_2_77/> However, the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar, [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of [[diffusion]] or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an [[interstellar medium]] of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.<ref name=mnras301_4_1099/>\n\nThe observed helium to hydrogen ratio in Vega is 0.030&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;0.005, which is about 40% lower than the Sun. This may be caused by the disappearance of a helium [[convection zone]] near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the [[radiation zone|radiative process]], which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.<ref name=apj348_712/>\n\n===Kinematics===\nThe [[radial velocity]] of Vega is the component of this star's motion along the line-of-sight to the Earth. Movement away from the Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower [[frequency]] (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion is toward the Earth. Thus the velocity can be measured from the amount of [[redshift]] (or [[blueshift]]) of the star's spectrum. Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of {{nowrap|\u221213.9 \u00b1 0.9 km/s}}.<ref name=rgcrv1966/> The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth.\n\nMotion transverse to the line of sight causes the position of Vega to shift with respect to the more distant background stars. Careful measurement of the star's position allows this angular movement, known as [[proper motion]], to be calculated. Vega's proper motion is {{nowrap|202.03 \u00b1 0.63 milli-[[Minute of arc|arcseconds]]}} (mas) per year in [[right ascension]]\u2014the celestial equivalent of [[longitude]]\u2014and {{nowrap|287.47 \u00b1 0.54 mas/y}} in [[declination]], which is equivalent to a change in [[latitude]]. The net proper motion of Vega is 327.78&nbsp;mas/y,<ref name=majewski2006/> which results in angular movement of a degree every 11,000&nbsp;years.\n\nIn the [[Galactic coordinate system]], the [[Space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]] components of Vega are (U, V, W) = {{nowrap|(\u221216.1 \u00b1 0.3, \u22126.3 \u00b1 0.8, \u22127.7 \u00b1 0.3) km/s}}, for a net space velocity of 19&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=aaa339/> The radial component of this velocity\u2014in the direction of the Sun\u2014is \u221213.9&nbsp;km/s, while the transverse velocity is 9.9&nbsp;km/s. Although Vega is at present only the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, the star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach the Sun.<ref name=moulton1906/> Vega will make its closest approach in an estimated 264,000 years at a [[perihelion]] distance of {{Convert|4.04|pc|ly|abbr=on|lk=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=aa575_A35/>\n\nBased on this star's kinematic properties, it appears to belong to a stellar association called the [[Castor Moving Group]]. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain.<ref name=apj708_1_71/> This group contains about 16 stars, including [[Alpha Librae]], [[Alpha Cephei]], [[Castor (star)|Castor]], [[Fomalhaut]] and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar [[Space velocity (astronomy)|space velocities]]. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an [[open cluster]] that has since become gravitationally unbound.<ref name=inglis2003/> The estimated age of this moving group is {{nowrap|200 \u00b1 100 million years}}, and they have an average space velocity of 16.5&nbsp;km/s.<ref group=note name=space_velocity/><ref name=aaa339/>\n\n==Possible planetary system==\n[[Image:Vega Spitzer.jpg|right|thumb|A mid-infrared (24&nbsp;\u03bcm) image of the [[debris disk]] around Vega]]\n\n=== Infrared excess ===\nOne of the early results from the [[Infrared Astronomy Satellite]] (IRAS) was the discovery of [[infrared excess|excess infrared flux]] coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at [[wavelength]]s of 25, 60, and 100&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u03bcm]], and came from within an angular radius of 10&nbsp;arcseconds (10\u2033) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension on the order of a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of [[Poynting\u2013Robertson effect|Poynting\u2013Robertson drag]].<ref name=\"apj285_808\" /> The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.<ref name=\"mnras_97_423\" />\n\nSubsequent measurements of Vega at 193&nbsp;\u03bcm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, suggesting that they must instead be on the order of 100&nbsp;\u03bcm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in the process of collapsing to form a planet.<ref name=apj285_808/> Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120&nbsp;AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80&nbsp;AU.<ref name=mnras314_4_702/>\n\nFollowing the discovery of an infrared excess around Vega, other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission. As of 2002, about 400 of these stars have been found, and they have come to be termed \"Vega-like\" or \"Vega-excess\" stars. It is believed that these may provide clues to the origin of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=apj124_1_514/>\n\n===Debris disks===\nBy 2005, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] had produced high-resolution infrared images of the dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43\u2033 (330&nbsp;AU) at a wavelength of 24&nbsp;\u03bcm, 70\u2033 (543&nbsp;AU) at 70&nbsp;\u03bcm and 105\u2033 (815&nbsp;AU) at 160&nbsp;\u03bcm. These much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1\u201350&nbsp;\u03bcm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3{{e|-3}} times the [[Earth mass|mass of the Earth]]. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the [[Kuiper Belt]] around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a [[debris disk]] around Vega, rather than from a [[protoplanetary disk]] as was earlier thought.<ref name=apj628_1_487/>\n\n[[Image:Massive Smash-Up at Vega.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Artist's concept of a recent massive collision of [[dwarf planet]]-sized objects that may have contributed to the dust ring around Vega]]\n\nThe inner boundary of the debris disk was estimated at 11\u2033&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;2\u2033, or 70\u2013100&nbsp;AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production of the amount of dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass\u2014estimated as hundreds of times the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]]. Hence it is more likely to have been produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.<ref name=apj628_1_487/>\n\nObservations, first with the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] by [[David Ciardi]] and [[Gerard van Belle]] in 2001<ref name=apj559_1_237/> and then later confirmed with the [[CHARA array]] at Mt. Wilson in 2006 and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array]] at Mt. Hopkins in 2011,<ref name=aaa534_1_237/> revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega. Originating within 8&nbsp;AU of the star, this [[exozodiacal dust]] may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system.<ref name=aaa452_1_237/> This may be caused by an intense bombardment of [[comet]]s or [[meteor]]s, and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system.<ref name=girault_rime_2006/>\n\n===Possible planets===\nObservations from the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] in 1997 revealed an \"elongated bright central region\" that peaked at 9\u2033 (70&nbsp;AU) to the northeast of Vega. This was hypothesized as either a perturbation of the dust disk by a [[extrasolar planet|planet]] or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust. However, images by the [[Keck telescope]] had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16, which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times the mass of Jupiter.<ref name=nature392_6678_788/> Astronomers at the [[Joint Astronomy Centre]] in Hawaii and at [[UCLA]] suggested that the image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation.<ref name=jac19980421/>\n\nDetermining the nature of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly [[Eccentric Jupiter|Jupiter-mass planet on an eccentric orbit]]. Dust would collect in orbits that have [[Orbital resonance|mean-motion resonances]] with this planet\u2014where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet\u2014producing the resulting clumpiness.<ref name=apj569_2_L115/>\n[[File:Vega (star).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Artist's impression of a planet around Vega]]\nIn 2003 it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly [[Neptune]]-mass planet having [[planetary migration|migrated]] from 40 to 65&nbsp;[[Astronomical Units|AU]] over 56&nbsp;million&nbsp;years,<ref name=apj598_2_1321/> an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller [[rocky planet]]s closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.<ref name=roe20031201/>\n\nUsing a [[coronagraph]] on the [[Subaru (telescope)|Subaru telescope]] in Hawaii in 2005, astronomers were able to further constrain the size of a planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5\u201310 times the mass of Jupiter.<ref name=apj652_2_1729/> The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the [[Plateau de Bure Interferometer]]. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet.<ref name=aaa531/> The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012)<ref name=\"hughes2012\"/> and the [[Herschel Space Telescope]].<ref name=\"sibthorpe2010\"/>\n\nAlthough a planet has yet to be directly observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, [[terrestrial planet]]s orbiting closer to the star. The [[inclination]] of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the [[equator]]ial plane of this star.<ref name=pasp97_180/>\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] constellation.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"coord\" />\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\n{{see also|Summer Triangle|Stars in astrology#Vega|Vega in fiction}}\nThe name is believed to be derived from the [[Arabic]] term ''Al Nesr al Waki'' '''\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639''' which appeared in the [[Al Achsasi al Mouakket]] star catalogue and was translated into [[Latin]] as ''Vultur Cadens'', \"the falling eagle/vulture\".<ref name=mnras55_429/><ref group=note name=vulture/> The constellation was represented as a vulture in [[ancient Egypt]],<ref name=massey2001/> and as an eagle or vulture in [[History of India|ancient India]].<ref name=olcott1911/><ref name=houlding2005/> The Arabic name then appeared in the [[western world]] in the [[Alfonsine Tables]],<ref name=Kunitzsch86/> which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of [[Alfonso&nbsp;X]].<ref name=brill7_292/> Medieval [[astrolabe]]s of England and [[Western Europe]] used the names Wega and Alvaca, and depicted it and [[Altair]] as birds.<ref name=Gingerish1987/>\n\nAmong the northern [[Polynesia]]n people, Vega was known as ''whetu o te tau'', the year star.

reference\n|Simbad=Vega\n}}\n{{Starbox end}}\n\n'''Vega''' is the brightest [[star]] in the northern [[constellation]] of [[Lyra]]. It has the [[Bayer designation]] '''\u03b1 Lyrae''', which is [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to '''Alpha Lyrae''' and abbreviated '''Alpha Lyr''' or '''\u03b1 Lyr'''. This star is [[List of star systems within 25\u201330 light-years|relatively close]] at only 25 [[light-year]]s from the [[Sun]], and, together with [[Arcturus]] and [[Sirius]], one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood. It is the [[list of brightest stars|fifth-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]], and the second-brightest star in the [[Northern Celestial Hemisphere|northern celestial hemisphere]], after Arcturus.\n\nVega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed \u201carguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun\u201d.<ref name=apj429_2_L81/> Vega was the [[North Star|northern]] [[pole star]] around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727, when the declination will be +86\u00b014'.<ref name=stellarium/> Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be [[Astrophotography|photographed]] and the first to have its [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] recorded.<ref name=barger_white2000/><ref name=paps24_166/> It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through [[parallax]] measurements. Vega has functioned as the baseline for calibrating the [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] brightness scale and was one of the stars used to define the [[Zero Point (photometry)|zero point]] for the [[UBV photometric system]].\n\nVega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive, its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher [[atomic number]] than that of [[helium]].<ref name=aaa391_3_1039/> Vega is also a [[variable star]] that varies slightly in brightness. It is [[stellar rotation|rotating]] rapidly with a velocity of 236&nbsp;km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's [[photosphere]] that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.<ref name=nature440_7086_896/>\n\nBased on an observed excess emission of [[infrared]] radiation, Vega appears to have a [[circumstellar disk]] of [[Cosmic dust|dust]]. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting [[debris disk]], which is analogous to the [[Kuiper belt]] in the [[Solar System]].<ref name=apj628_1_487/> Stars that display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.<ref name=apj124_1_514/>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\n''\u03b1 Lyrae'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Alpha Lyrae'') is the star's [[Bayer designation]]. The traditional name ''Vega'' (earlier ''Wega''<ref name=allen1963/>) comes from a loose transliteration of the [[Arabic]] word ''{{transl|ar|w\u0101qi\u2018}}'' meaning \"falling\" or \"landing\", via the phrase ''{{transl|ar|an-nasr al-w\u0101qi\u2018}}'', \"the falling eagle\".<ref name=glasse2008/> In 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] organized a [[IAU Working Group on Star Names|Working Group on Star Names]] (WGSN)<ref name=\"WGSN\"/> to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016<ref name=\"WGSN1\"/> included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included ''Vega'' for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/>\n\n==Observation==\n[[Image:Summer triangle.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Summer Triangle]]]]\nVega can often be seen near the [[zenith]] in the mid-northern [[latitude]]s during the evening in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] summer.<ref name=pasachoff2000/> From mid-southern latitudes, it can be seen low above the northern horizon during the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter. With a [[declination]] of +38.78\u00b0, Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of [[51st parallel south|51\u00b0 S]]. Therefore, it does not rise at all anywhere in [[Antarctica]] or in the southernmost part of South America, including [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]] (53\u00b0 S). At latitudes to the north of +51\u00b0 N, Vega remains continuously above the horizon as a [[circumpolar star]]. Around July 1, Vega reaches midnight [[culmination]] when it crosses the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] at that time.<ref name=burnham1978/>\n\n[[File:Precession N.gif|thumb|The path of the north celestial pole among the stars due to the precession. Vega is the bright star near the bottom|alt=Small white disks representing the northern stars on a black background, overlaid by a circle showing the position of the north pole over time]]\nEach night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it will remain in the same position and thus is called a [[pole star]]. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the [[Precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]]. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770&nbsp;years,<ref name=chaikin1990/> during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the [[celestial sphere]] that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is [[Polaris]], but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000.<ref name=roy_clarke2003/> Vega is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.<ref name=\"allen1963\" />\n\nThis star lies at a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of a widely spaced [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] called the [[Summer Triangle]], which consists of Vega plus the two first-magnitude stars [[Altair]], in [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]], and [[Deneb]] in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].<ref name=pasachoff2000/> This formation is the approximate shape of a [[right triangle]], with Vega located at its [[right angle]]. The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity.<ref name=upgren1998/>\n\n==Observational history==\n[[File:Vega by Stephen Rahn.jpg|thumb|Astrophoto of Vega]]\n[[Astrophotography]], the [[photography]] of celestial objects, began in 1840 when [[John William Draper]] took an image of the [[Moon]] using the [[daguerreotype]] process. On July 17, 1850, Vega became the first star (other than the Sun) to be photographed, when it was imaged by [[William Cranch Bond|William Bond]] and [[John Adams Whipple]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], also with a daguerreotype.<ref name=allen1963/><ref name=barger_white2000/><ref name=pasp2_10_249/> [[Henry Draper]] took the first photograph of a star's [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrum]] in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega, and he also became the first person to show [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of a star.<ref name=paps24_166/> Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun.<ref name=aip/> In 1879, [[William Huggins]] used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve \"very strong lines\" that were common to this stellar category. These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen [[Balmer series]].<ref name=klaus2002/> Since 1943, the [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]] of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.<ref name=baas25_1319/>\n\nThe distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the [[Earth]] orbits the Sun. The first person to publish a star's parallax was [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve|Friedrich G. W. von Struve]], when he announced a value of 0.125&nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] (0.125\u2033) for Vega.<ref name=berry1899/> [[Friedrich Bessel]] was skeptical about Struve's data, and, when Bessel published a parallax of 0.314\u2033 for the star system [[61 Cygni]], Struve revised his value for Vega's parallax to nearly double the original estimate. This change cast further doubt on Struve's data. Thus most astronomers at the time, including Struve, credited Bessel with the first published parallax result. However, Struve's initial result was actually close to the currently accepted value of 0.129\u2033,<ref name=debarbat1988/><ref name=astroprof/> as determined by the [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/><ref name=aaa323_L49/><ref name=GSM/>\n\nThe brightness of a star, as seen from Earth, is measured with a standardized, [[logarithmic scale]]. This [[apparent magnitude]] is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest in the night sky, [[Sirius]], is of magnitude \u22121.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] brightness scales.<ref name=garfinkle1997/> However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified [[flux]]. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration and varies in brightness.<ref name=ajss45_83/>\n\nThe [[UBV photometric system]] measures the magnitude of stars through [[ultraviolet]], blue, and yellow filters, producing ''U'', ''B'', and ''V'' values, respectively. Vega is one of six [[A-type main-sequence star|A0V stars]] that were used to set the initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in the 1950s. The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as: {{nowrap|''U'' \u2212 ''B''}} = {{nowrap|''B'' \u2212 ''V''}} =&nbsp;0. In effect, the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow, blue, and ultraviolet parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref name=apj117_313/> Thus, Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region\u2014wavelength range 350\u2013850 [[nanometer]]s, most of which can be seen with the human eye\u2014so the flux densities are roughly equal; 2000\u20134000&nbsp;[[Jansky|Jy]].<ref name=eso20020306/> However, the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the [[infrared]], and is near 100 Jy at 5&nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometers]].<ref name=mcmahon2005/>\n\nPhotometric measurements of Vega during the 1930s appeared to show that the star had a low-magnitude variability on the order of \u00b10.03 magnitudes (around \u00b12.8%<ref group=note name=deltaLum/> luminosity). This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time, and so the subject of Vega's variability has been controversial. The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the [[David Dunlap Observatory]] and showed some slight variability. Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low-amplitude pulsations associated with a [[Delta Scuti variable]].<ref name=asp93_2_333/> This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.<ref name=araa33_1_75/> Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable, other observers have found no such variation. Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement.<ref name=merezhin/><ref name=hayes1984/> However, a 2007 article surveyed these and other results, and concluded that \"A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1-2% range, with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4% from the mean\".<ref name=gray2007/> Also, a 2011 article affirms that \"The long-term (year-to-year) variability of Vega was confirmed\".<ref name=butkovskaya2011/>\n\nVega became the first solitary [[main-sequence star]] beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an [[Aerobee]] 350 from the [[White Sands Missile Range]].<ref name=apj229_661/> In 1983, Vega became the first star found to have a disk of dust. The [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]] (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.<ref name=nature307_5950_441/>\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nVega's [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] is A0V, making it a blue-tinged white [[main sequence]] star that is [[nuclear fusion|fusing]] [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]] in its core. Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones, Vega's main-sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years, a tenth of the Sun's.<ref name=ajss40_733/> The current age of this star is about 455&nbsp;million years,<ref name=apj708_1_71/> or up to about half its expected total main-sequence lifespan. After leaving the main sequence, Vega will become a class-M [[red giant]] and shed much of its mass, finally becoming a [[white dwarf]]. At present, Vega has more than twice the mass<ref name=nature440_7086_896/> of the Sun and its [[bolometric luminosity]] is about 40 times the Sun's. Because it is rapidly-rotating and seen nearly pole-on, its apparent luminosity, calculated assuming it was the same brightness all over, is about 57 times the Sun's.<ref name=apj645_1_664/> If Vega is variable, then it may be a [[Delta Scuti variable|Delta Scuti type]] with a period of about 0.107&nbsp;days.<ref name=asp93_2_333/>\n\nMost of the energy produced at Vega's core is generated by the carbon&ndash;nitrogen&ndash;oxygen cycle ([[CNO cycle]]), a [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|nuclear fusion]] process that combines [[proton]]s to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process becomes dominant at a temperature of about 17&nbsp;million&nbsp;K,<ref name=salaris_cassisi2005/> which is slightly higher than the core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's [[proton-proton chain reaction]] fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a [[convection zone]] about the core<ref name=apj601_1_512/> that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in [[Radiative transfer|radiative equilibrium]]. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a [[radiation zone]] centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.<ref name=padmanabhan2002/>\n\nThe energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources. At 5480&nbsp;\u00c5, the flux density is 3,650&nbsp;[[Jansky|Jy]] with an error margin of 2%.<ref name=apj161_1015/> The visual spectrum of Vega is dominated by [[absorption line]]s of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] with the [[electron]] at the n=2 [[principal quantum number]].<ref name=richmond/><ref name=clayton1983/> The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[chromium]].<ref name=mnras197_57/> The [[X-ray]] emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the [[corona]] for this star must be very weak or non-existent.<ref name=aaa318_215/> However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar [[coronal hole]] may be present,<ref name=apj229_661/><ref name=sao389/> confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted along the line of sight.<ref name=sao389/><ref name=apj213_5_874/>\n\nUsing [[spectropolarimetry]], a [[magnetic field]] has been detected on the surface of Vega by a team of astronomers at the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Observatoire du Pic du Midi]]. This is the first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class A star that is not an [[Ap and Bp star|Ap]] [[chemically peculiar star]]. The average line of sight component of this field has a strength of {{nowrap|\u22120.6 \u00b1 0.3 [[Gauss (unit)|G]]}}.<ref name=aaa500_3_L41/> This is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun.<ref name=sd20090726/> Magnetic fields of roughly 30 gauss have been reported for Vega, compared to about 1 gauss for the Sun.<ref name=apj229_661/> In 2015, bright [[star spot]]s were detected on the star's surface\u2014the first such detection for a normal A-type star, and these features show evidence of [[rotational modulation]] with a period of 0.68&nbsp;days.<ref name=aa577_A64/>\n\n===Rotation===\nWhen the radius of Vega was measured to high accuracy with an [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometer]], it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of {{nowrap|2.73 \u00b1 0.01}} times the [[solar radius|radius of the Sun]]. This is 60% larger than the radius of the star Sirius, while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12% larger. However, this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from the direction of its pole of rotation. Observations by the [[CHARA array]] in 2005\u201306 confirmed this deduction.<ref name=apj645_1_664/>\n\n[[Image:Size Vega.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Size comparison of Vega (left) to the Sun (right)]]\nThe pole of Vega\u2014its axis of rotation\u2014is inclined no more than five degrees from the line-of-sight to the Earth. At the high end of estimates for the [[stellar rotation|rotation]] velocity for Vega is {{nowrap|236.2 \u00b1 3.7 km/s}}<ref name=apj708_1_71/> along the equator, much higher than the observed (i.e. [[projected rotational velocity|projected]]) rotational velocity because Vega is seen almost pole-on. This is 88% of the speed that would cause the star to start breaking up from [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] effects.<ref name=apj708_1_71/> This rapid rotation of Vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge, so the radius of the equator is 19% larger than the polar radius. (The estimated polar radius of this star is {{nowrap|2.362 \u00b1 0.012 }}[[solar radius|solar radii]], while the equatorial radius is {{nowrap|2.818 \u00b1 0.013}} solar radii.<ref name=apj708_1_71/>) From the Earth, this bulge is being viewed from the direction of its pole, producing the overly large radius estimate.\n\nThe local [[surface gravity]] at the poles is greater than at the equator, which produces a variation in [[effective temperature]] over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], while the equatorial temperature is about 8,152&nbsp;K.<ref name=apj708_1_71/>  This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong [[gravity darkening]] effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower-intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star.  The temperature gradient may also mean that Vega has a convection zone around the equator,<ref name=apj645_1_664/><ref name=noao2006/> while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure [[Radiation zone|radiative equilibrium]].<ref name=adelman2004/>  By the [[Von Zeipel theorem]], the local luminosity is higher at the poles.  As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its [[equator]] instead of almost pole-on, then its overall brightness would be lower.\n\nAs Vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes, the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow improved instrument calibrations.<ref name=science317_5836_325/>\n\n===Element abundance===\nIn astronomy, those elements with higher [[atomic number]]s than helium are termed \"metals\". The [[metallicity]] of Vega's [[photosphere]] is only about 32% of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun's atmosphere.<ref group=note name=metal/> (Compare this, for example, to a threefold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun.) For comparison, the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about Z<sub>Sol</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.0172&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;0.002.<ref name=apj644_2_1291/> Thus, in terms of abundances, only about 0.54% of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium.\n\nThe unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak [[Lambda Bo\u00f6tis star]].<ref name=bicds38_137/><ref name=apj548_2_77/> However, the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar, [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of [[diffusion]] or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an [[interstellar medium]] of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.<ref name=mnras301_4_1099/>\n\nThe observed helium to hydrogen ratio in Vega is 0.030&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;0.005, which is about 40% lower than the Sun. This may be caused by the disappearance of a helium [[convection zone]] near the surface. Energy transfer is instead performed by the [[radiation zone|radiative process]], which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.<ref name=apj348_712/>\n\n===Kinematics===\nThe [[radial velocity]] of Vega is the component of this star's motion along the line-of-sight to the Earth. Movement away from the Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower [[frequency]] (toward the red), or to a higher frequency (toward the blue) if the motion is toward the Earth. Thus the velocity can be measured from the amount of [[redshift]] (or [[blueshift]]) of the star's spectrum. Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of {{nowrap|\u221213.9 \u00b1 0.9 km/s}}.<ref name=rgcrv1966/> The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth.\n\nMotion transverse to the line of sight causes the position of Vega to shift with respect to the more distant background stars. Careful measurement of the star's position allows this angular movement, known as [[proper motion]], to be calculated. Vega's proper motion is {{nowrap|202.03 \u00b1 0.63 milli-[[Minute of arc|arcseconds]]}} (mas) per year in [[right ascension]]\u2014the celestial equivalent of [[longitude]]\u2014and {{nowrap|287.47 \u00b1 0.54 mas/y}} in [[declination]], which is equivalent to a change in [[latitude]]. The net proper motion of Vega is 327.78&nbsp;mas/y,<ref name=majewski2006/> which results in angular movement of a degree every 11,000&nbsp;years.\n\nIn the [[Galactic coordinate system]], the [[Space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]] components of Vega are (U, V, W) = {{nowrap|(\u221216.1 \u00b1 0.3, \u22126.3 \u00b1 0.8, \u22127.7 \u00b1 0.3) km/s}}, for a net space velocity of 19&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=aaa339/> The radial component of this velocity\u2014in the direction of the Sun\u2014is \u221213.9&nbsp;km/s, while the transverse velocity is 9.9&nbsp;km/s. Although Vega is at present only the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, the star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach the Sun.<ref name=moulton1906/> Vega will make its closest approach in an estimated 264,000 years at a [[perihelion]] distance of {{Convert|4.04|pc|ly|abbr=on|lk=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=aa575_A35/>\n\nBased on this star's kinematic properties, it appears to belong to a stellar association called the [[Castor Moving Group]]. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain.<ref name=apj708_1_71/> This group contains about 16 stars, including [[Alpha Librae]], [[Alpha Cephei]], [[Castor (star)|Castor]], [[Fomalhaut]] and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar [[Space velocity (astronomy)|space velocities]]. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an [[open cluster]] that has since become gravitationally unbound.<ref name=inglis2003/> The estimated age of this moving group is {{nowrap|200 \u00b1 100 million years}}, and they have an average space velocity of 16.5&nbsp;km/s.<ref group=note name=space_velocity/><ref name=aaa339/>\n\n==Possible planetary system==\n[[Image:Vega Spitzer.jpg|right|thumb|A mid-infrared (24&nbsp;\u03bcm) image of the [[debris disk]] around Vega]]\n\n=== Infrared excess ===\nOne of the early results from the [[Infrared Astronomy Satellite]] (IRAS) was the discovery of [[infrared excess|excess infrared flux]] coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at [[wavelength]]s of 25, 60, and 100&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u03bcm]], and came from within an angular radius of 10&nbsp;arcseconds (10\u2033) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension on the order of a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of [[Poynting\u2013Robertson effect|Poynting\u2013Robertson drag]].<ref name=\"apj285_808\" /> The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.<ref name=\"mnras_97_423\" />\n\nSubsequent measurements of Vega at 193&nbsp;\u03bcm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, suggesting that they must instead be on the order of 100&nbsp;\u03bcm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in the process of collapsing to form a planet.<ref name=apj285_808/> Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120&nbsp;AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80&nbsp;AU.<ref name=mnras314_4_702/>\n\nFollowing the discovery of an infrared excess around Vega, other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission. As of 2002, about 400 of these stars have been found, and they have come to be termed \"Vega-like\" or \"Vega-excess\" stars. It is believed that these may provide clues to the origin of the [[Solar System]].<ref name=apj124_1_514/>\n\n===Debris disks===\nBy 2005, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] had produced high-resolution infrared images of the dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43\u2033 (330&nbsp;AU) at a wavelength of 24&nbsp;\u03bcm, 70\u2033 (543&nbsp;AU) at 70&nbsp;\u03bcm and 105\u2033 (815&nbsp;AU) at 160&nbsp;\u03bcm. These much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1\u201350&nbsp;\u03bcm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3{{e|-3}} times the [[Earth mass|mass of the Earth]]. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the [[Kuiper Belt]] around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a [[debris disk]] around Vega, rather than from a [[protoplanetary disk]] as was earlier thought.<ref name=apj628_1_487/>\n\n[[Image:Massive Smash-Up at Vega.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Artist's concept of a recent massive collision of [[dwarf planet]]-sized objects that may have contributed to the dust ring around Vega]]\n\nThe inner boundary of the debris disk was estimated at 11\u2033&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;2\u2033, or 70\u2013100&nbsp;AU. The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward. However, continuous production of the amount of dust observed over the course of Vega's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass\u2014estimated as hundreds of times the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]]. Hence it is more likely to have been produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate-sized (or larger) comet or asteroid, which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies. This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star's age, and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust.<ref name=apj628_1_487/>\n\nObservations, first with the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] by [[David Ciardi]] and [[Gerard van Belle]] in 2001<ref name=apj559_1_237/> and then later confirmed with the [[CHARA array]] at Mt. Wilson in 2006 and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array]] at Mt. Hopkins in 2011,<ref name=aaa534_1_237/> revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega. Originating within 8&nbsp;AU of the star, this [[exozodiacal dust]] may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system.<ref name=aaa452_1_237/> This may be caused by an intense bombardment of [[comet]]s or [[meteor]]s, and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system.<ref name=girault_rime_2006/>\n\n===Possible planets===\nObservations from the [[James Clerk Maxwell Telescope]] in 1997 revealed an \"elongated bright central region\" that peaked at 9\u2033 (70&nbsp;AU) to the northeast of Vega. This was hypothesized as either a perturbation of the dust disk by a [[extrasolar planet|planet]] or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust. However, images by the [[Keck telescope]] had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16, which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times the mass of Jupiter.<ref name=nature392_6678_788/> Astronomers at the [[Joint Astronomy Centre]] in Hawaii and at [[UCLA]] suggested that the image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation.<ref name=jac19980421/>\n\nDetermining the nature of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly [[Eccentric Jupiter|Jupiter-mass planet on an eccentric orbit]]. Dust would collect in orbits that have [[Orbital resonance|mean-motion resonances]] with this planet\u2014where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet\u2014producing the resulting clumpiness.<ref name=apj569_2_L115/>\n[[File:Vega (star).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Artist's impression of a planet around Vega]]\nIn 2003 it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly [[Neptune]]-mass planet having [[planetary migration|migrated]] from 40 to 65&nbsp;[[Astronomical Units|AU]] over 56&nbsp;million&nbsp;years,<ref name=apj598_2_1321/> an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller [[rocky planet]]s closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.<ref name=roe20031201/>\n\nUsing a [[coronagraph]] on the [[Subaru (telescope)|Subaru telescope]] in Hawaii in 2005, astronomers were able to further constrain the size of a planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5\u201310 times the mass of Jupiter.<ref name=apj652_2_1729/> The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer, more sensitive instrumentation on the [[Plateau de Bure Interferometer]]. The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric. No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier, casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet.<ref name=aaa531/> The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow-up observations by Hughes et al. (2012)<ref name=\"hughes2012\"/> and the [[Herschel Space Telescope]].<ref name=\"sibthorpe2010\"/>\n\nAlthough a planet has yet to be directly observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, [[terrestrial planet]]s orbiting closer to the star. The [[inclination]] of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the [[equator]]ial plane of this star.<ref name=pasp97_180/>\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] constellation.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"coord\" />\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\n{{see also|Summer Triangle|Stars in astrology#Vega|Vega in fiction}}\nThe name is believed to be derived from the [[Arabic]] term ''Al Nesr al Waki'' '''\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639''' which appeared in the [[Al Achsasi al Mouakket]] star catalogue and was translated into [[Latin]] as ''Vultur Cadens'', \"the falling eagle/vulture\".<ref name=mnras55_429/><ref group=note name=vulture/> The constellation was represented as a vulture in [[ancient Egypt]],<ref name=massey2001/> and as an eagle or vulture in [[History of India|ancient India]].<ref name=olcott1911/><ref name=houlding2005/> The Arabic name then appeared in the [[western world]] in the [[Alfonsine Tables]],<ref name=Kunitzsch86/> which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of [[Alfonso&nbsp;X]].<ref name=brill7_292/> Medieval [[astrolabe]]s of England and [[Western Europe]] used the names Wega and Alvaca, and depicted it and [[Altair]] as birds.<ref name=Gingerish1987/>\n\nAmong the northern [[Polynesia]]n people, Vega was known as ''whetu o te tau'', the year star.

[[Mathew Horne]] and [[Joanna Page]] play the titular characters [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gavin Shipman|Gavin]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Stacey Shipman|Stacey]] and the writers star as [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Smithy]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa]]. Other prominent cast members include [[Alison Steadman]] and [[Larry Lamb]], who play Gavin's parents ([[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]]), and [[Melanie Walters]] and [[Rob Brydon]], who portray Stacey's mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]].\n\nThe show was produced by [[Baby Cow Productions]] for [[BBC Wales]]. It was broadcast from 13 May 2007 to 1 January 2010; a total of 20 episodes across three series shown on [[BBC Three]] and then on [[BBC One]]. Episodes of the final series formed a significant part of the prime time BBC seasonal programming; broadcast on Christmas Day 2009 and New Year's Day 2010. In May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special, which aired on BBC One on Christmas Day. The 2019 special attracted 18.49 million viewers, making it the most viewed non-sporting event in a decade in the United Kingdom, and the most watched comedy in 17 years.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50975665</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/JKCorden/status/1133252827235717120?s=19 Twitter @JKCorden].

It won several awards, including the [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTAs) Audience Award, and the [[British Comedy Awards]] Best TV Comedy Award, both in 2008. The programme has also been well received in several other countries in which it has aired. In 2019, ''Gavin & Stacey'' was named the 17th greatest British sitcom in a poll by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/fawlty-towers-best-sitcom-british-list-only-fools-horses-father-ted-a8860986.html Fawlty Towers named best British sitcom of all time, beating Blackadder and Only Fools and Horses]. ''The Independent'', 9 April 2019.</ref> The series was directed by Christine Gernon who had previously directed other popular BBC sitcoms such as ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''.\n\n==Scenario==\nThe show follows the romance between [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gavin Shipman|Gavin]], from [[Billericay]] in [[Essex]], and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Stacey Shipman|Stacey]], from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]]. Initially, Gavin lives with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]], and spends most of his time with his best friend, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Smithy]]. Stacey lives with her widowed mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and is frequently visited by her uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]], who lives across the road, and by her best friend [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa]].\nThe series follows the key moments in their relationship: their first meeting, meeting each other's families, getting engaged, marrying, looking for a flat, briefly splitting up, looking for new jobs and trying for children.\n\nThe characters of Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional core of the story. The show focuses on the situations that arise when their relationship brings their two differing families together. As a result, episodes often focus on the key events in life that bring wider families and close friends together such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmases. However, the show also presents the families interacting in deliberately non-dramatic situations, such as a visit to the beach and nights out.\n\nA significant second storyline follows the contrasting relationship between Smithy and Nessa. Despite their dislike for each other, they have several one-night stands, leading to Nessa becoming pregnant and having their baby. Whilst Gavin and Stacey are the clear main characters, towards the end of the show's run, the dramatic emphasis switches slightly from them, as they resolve their distance issues, to Smithy and Nessa, as Nessa becomes engaged to another man.\n\nOther storylines that run throughout the course of the three series include Pam's fake [[vegetarian]]ism, Bryn and his nephew [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Jason West|Jason]]'s struggle to keep the events of their disastrous fishing trip a secret (with the outcome never actually being revealed), and the ridiculously rocky marriage of Pam's friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pete Sutcliffe|Pete]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dawn Sutcliffe|Dawn]].\n\n==Characters and cast==\n{{further|List of Gavin & Stacey characters}}The surnames of known English [[serial killers]] were used for some of the main characters \u2013 [[Harold Shipman|Shipman]], [[Fred West|West]] and [[Peter Sutcliffe|Sutcliffe]].<ref name=\"surnames2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html|title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin & Stacey|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] commented in 2009: \"I suppose we were hoping that people wouldn't realise and then when it does come to light, it's even more delicious...\"<ref name=\"surnames3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|title=Victims' families complain about Gavin & Stacey serial killer names|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Heat Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812030230/http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|archive-date=12 August 2012|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Main===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Corden 2014.jpg\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Ruth Jones Little Britain Gavin and Stacey.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption2 = [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones]], co-writers and stars of the show\n}}\n\n* Gavin Shipman ([[Mathew Horne]]) \u2013 nicknamed \"Gavlar\", or \"Gavalar\", the funny and enthusiastic level-headed protagonist from [[Billericay]], [[Essex]].\n* Stacey Shipman (''n\u00e9e'' West) ([[Joanna Page]]) \u2013 bubbly protagonist from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].\n* Neil \"Smithy\" Smith ([[James Corden]]) \u2013 Gavin's oldest and closest friend, who also lives in Billericay, Essex.

Gavin is 28 and lives at home in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] ([[Alison Steadman]]). He and Stacey, along with their respective best friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Neil \"Smithy\" Smith]] ([[James Corden]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa Jenkins]] ([[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]]), go out on a double date. The night ends with Gavin and Stacey returning to a hotel room and sleeping together, as do Smithy and Nessa. Gavin and Stacey become infatuated with each other, but Smithy and Nessa are happy to forget their drunken [[one-night stand]] and make little contact with one another afterwards. In the rest of the series, Gavin and Stacey continue their long-distance relationship before becoming engaged and getting married on 6 April 2007. The series ends with Nessa going to inform Smithy that she is pregnant with his child but changes her mind at the last minute.\n\n===Series 2 (2008)===\nThe second series begins with the newlyweds arriving from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipmans' house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations&nbsp;\u2013 especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles to find a job and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Rudi Smith|Rudi]] ([[Sheridan Smith]]), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil, the baby|Neil]]. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.\n\n===Christmas special (2008)===\nAn extended Christmas special involves Stacey's family, along with Nessa and her partner, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dave Coaches|Dave Coaches]] ([[Steffan Rhodri]]), spending Christmas with Gavin's parents. Gavin reveals that he has found a job in Cardiff, which at first causes upset for Pam and Smithy, but they both learn to accept it. Gavin later admits to Smithy that he is moving to Barry with Stacey in order to save his marriage. Smithy also gets upset when he feels that Dave, who lives with the baby, Neil, is replacing him as a father. Smithy is furthermore unhappy after Dave proposes to Nessa (with the ring enclosed in a cigarette packet), and she accepts.\n\n===Series 3 (2009\u20132010)===\nGavin begins on his new job in Wales and his parents and Smithy travel to Wales for Neil's christening. In the next episode Gavin and Stacey, and Nessa and her child Neil, spend the weekend at Pam and Mick's, and after a drunken night, it is believed that Nessa and Smithy may have once again had sex after waking up in bed together the next morning. Gavin and Stacey begin trying for a baby and Stacey is upset and disappointed when she learns that they may not be able to have children. Gavin becomes depressed and preoccupied with this issue, and in an attempt to cheer him up, Pam, Mick and Smithy arrange a surprise trip to Barry beach on a sunny bank holiday. Nessa and Dave also run into trouble after Dave learns about her alleged sexual intercourse with Smithy, but the two decide to go ahead with the wedding. In the final episode, Stacey discovers she is pregnant after all, and the couple are overjoyed and excited. Smithy shows up at Nessa and Dave's wedding ceremony with Neil, pleading for her not to marry him, and accusing her of not loving Dave. Dave, much to everyone's surprise, agrees with Smithy that Nessa does not love him, and the ceremony is called off. The series ends showing the four (Gavin, Stacey, Nessa and Smithy) six months later on Barry beachfront, with a visibly pregnant Stacey.\n\n===Christmas special (2019)===\nIn May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special. The programme aired on BBC One on 25 December 2019. The episode started off with Gavin and Stacey, who now have three children, and are living in Barry next door to Stacey's mum after Doris - who died several years before - left them the property in her will. Nessa and Smithy's child, Neil (known as \"Neil, the Baby\u201d) is now eleven. Smithy has started a new relationship with Sonia ([[Laura Aikman]]) and he plans to propose to her on Christmas Day. Gwen, Bryn & Jason join together to celebrate the holiday, together with Pam and Mick, who spent Christmas Eve with Dawn and Pete. At the end of the episode, Nessa tells Smithy that she loves him, and she [[Marriage proposal|proposes]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brydon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rob Brydon]] plays Uncle Bryn]]\n[[File:You'll Have Had Your Tea - Alison Steadman.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Alison Steadman]] plays Pam Shipman]]\n\nThe idea for the show occurred to actor [[James Corden]] during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]], whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama ''[[Fat Friends]]''. Corden claims to have been inspired by the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play entitled It's My Day, but the BBC instead asked for a full series.<ref name=Times06March2008USRemake>{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3495129.ece|title=Gavin & Stacey to be given US remake|newspaper=The Times | date = 6 March 2008 | accessdate = 6 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to [[Mathew Horne]] and [[Joanna Page]] on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for [[Rob Brydon]], who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for [[Alison Steadman]], who had also worked on ''Fat Friends''. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom ''[[Nighty Night]]'', and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with [[Adrian Scarborough]] in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, ''[[The History Boys]]'', which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in ''The History Boys''.\n\nAlthough the programme is set in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], the three series were shot largely in [[Cardiff]] (which acted as the city itself but also as parts of Billericay), and also in Barry itself and the surrounding area, including [[Dinas Powys]], [[Sully, Vale of Glamorgan|Sully]] and [[Penarth]]. The show's popularity has been credited with boosting the tourist trade to Barry and its popular seafront of [[Barry Island]], through visitors wishing to visit the various filming locations.\nGavin's house was set in Billericay but was actually filmed on location in Laburnum Way, Dinas Powys in Wales. The opening episode features location shooting in [[Leicester Square]] in London which was filmed in 2006.\n<ref name=BarryTraders>{{cite web |url=http://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/news/latestnews/4837541.Barry_Island_traders___We_must_make_the_most_of_Gavin___Stacey_/ | title=Barry Island traders: 'We must make the most of Gavin & Stacey' |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Newsquest |work=Barry and District News}}</ref><ref name=BBCTownPlansTrail>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7405307.stm | title=Town plans Gavin and Stacey trail |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=WesternMailNewYearsDayHit>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/04/gavin-and-stacey-a-new-year-s-day-hit-91466-25520204/ | title=Gavin and Stacey a New Year's Day hit |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nAfter the debut of the show on BBC Three, a second series was soon commissioned. Speaking about the second series, Corden said \"It's the show that we wanted to make. If people like it, they like it: if they don't, they don't. That's a nice feeling, that's quite freeing... There's more of a journey and more of a story. We hope the viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it\", while Jones said \"Series one had a very specific storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding.

In an April 2008 interview, Jones said \"We never intended to write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable.

Other prominent cast members include [[Alison Steadman]] and [[Larry Lamb]], who play Gavin's parents ([[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]]), and [[Melanie Walters]] and [[Rob Brydon]], who portray Stacey's mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]].\n\nThe show was produced by [[Baby Cow Productions]] for [[BBC Wales]]. It was broadcast from 13 May 2007 to 1 January 2010; a total of 20 episodes across three series shown on [[BBC Three]] and then on [[BBC One]].

In May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special that aired on BBC One on Christmas Day.

It won several awards, including the [[British Academy Television Awards]] (BAFTAs) Audience Award, and the [[British Comedy Awards]] Best TV Comedy Award, both in 2008. The programme has also been well received in several other countries in which it has aired. In 2019, ''Gavin & Stacey'' was named the 17th greatest British sitcom in a poll by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/fawlty-towers-best-sitcom-british-list-only-fools-horses-father-ted-a8860986.html Fawlty Towers named best British sitcom of all time, beating Blackadder and Only Fools and Horses]. ''The Independent'', 9 April 2019.</ref> The series was directed by Christine Gernon who had previously directed other popular BBC sitcoms such as ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''.\n\n==Scenario==\nThe show follows the romance between [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gavin Shipman|Gavin]], from [[Billericay]] in [[Essex]], and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Stacey Shipman|Stacey]], from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]]. Initially, Gavin lives with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]], and spends most of his time with his best friend, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Smithy]]. Stacey lives with her widowed mother, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Gwen West|Gwen]], and is frequently visited by her uncle, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Bryn West|Bryn]], who lives across the road, and by her best friend [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa]].\nThe series follows the key moments in their relationship: their first meeting, meeting each other's families, getting engaged, marrying, looking for a flat, briefly splitting up, looking for new jobs and trying for children.\n\nThe characters of Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional core of the story. The show focuses on the situations that arise when their relationship brings their two differing families together. As a result, episodes often focus on the key events in life that bring wider families and close friends together such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmases. However, the show also presents the families interacting in deliberately non-dramatic situations, such as a visit to the beach and nights out.\n\nA significant second storyline follows the contrasting relationship between Smithy and Nessa. Despite their dislike for each other, they have several one-night stands, leading to Nessa becoming pregnant and having their baby. Whilst Gavin and Stacey are the clear main characters, towards the end of the show's run, the dramatic emphasis switches slightly from them, as they resolve their distance issues, to Smithy and Nessa, as Nessa becomes engaged to another man.\n\nOther storylines that run throughout the course of the three series include Pam's fake [[vegetarian]]ism, Bryn and his nephew [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Jason West|Jason]]'s struggle to keep the events of their disastrous fishing trip a secret (with the outcome never actually being revealed), and the ridiculously rocky marriage of Pam's friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pete Sutcliffe|Pete]] and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dawn Sutcliffe|Dawn]].\n\n==Characters and cast==\n{{further|List of Gavin & Stacey characters}}The surnames of known English [[serial killers]] were used for some of the main characters \u2013 [[Harold Shipman|Shipman]], [[Fred West|West]] and [[Peter Sutcliffe|Sutcliffe]].<ref name=\"surnames2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/cardiff-confidential-saying-farewell-to-gavin-amp-stacey-1824969.html|title=Cardiff confidential: Saying farewell to Gavin & Stacey|date=21 November 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref> [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]] commented in 2009: \"I suppose we were hoping that people wouldn't realise and then when it does come to light, it's even more delicious...\"<ref name=\"surnames3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|title=Victims' families complain about Gavin & Stacey serial killer names|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Heat Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812030230/http://www.heatworld.com/Entertainment/TV/2009/01/Victims-families-complain-about-Gavin--Stacey-serial-killer-names/|archive-date=12 August 2012|accessdate=4 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Main===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 170\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = James Corden 2014.jpg\n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Ruth Jones Little Britain Gavin and Stacey.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption2 = [[James Corden]] and [[Ruth Jones]], co-writers and stars of the show\n}}\n\n* Gavin Shipman ([[Mathew Horne]]) \u2013 nicknamed \"Gavlar\", or \"Gavalar\", the funny and enthusiastic level-headed protagonist from [[Billericay]], [[Essex]].\n* Stacey Shipman (''n\u00e9e'' West) ([[Joanna Page]]) \u2013 bubbly protagonist from [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]].\n* Neil \"Smithy\" Smith ([[James Corden]]) \u2013 Gavin's oldest and closest friend, who also lives in Billericay, Essex.

Gavin is 28 and lives at home in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], with his parents, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Mick Shipman|Mick]] ([[Larry Lamb]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Pam Shipman|Pam]] ([[Alison Steadman]]). He and Stacey, along with their respective best friends [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil \"Smithy\" Smith|Neil \"Smithy\" Smith]] ([[James Corden]]) and [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Nessa Jenkins|Nessa Jenkins]] ([[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]]), go out on a double date. The night ends with Gavin and Stacey returning to a hotel room and sleeping together, as do Smithy and Nessa. Gavin and Stacey become infatuated with each other, but Smithy and Nessa are happy to forget their drunken [[one-night stand]] and make little contact with one another afterwards. In the rest of the series, Gavin and Stacey continue their long-distance relationship before becoming engaged and getting married on 6 April 2007. The series ends with Nessa going to inform Smithy that she is pregnant with his child but changes her mind at the last minute.\n\n===Series 2 (2008)===\nThe second series begins with the newlyweds arriving from a honeymoon in Greece. The in-laws meet again at the Shipmans' house in Essex, where Nessa has some shocking revelations&nbsp;\u2013 especially for Smithy, who learns that she is pregnant with his baby, and although he makes it clear he thoroughly dislikes the woman, he is generally civil and supportive towards her about their child. Meanwhile, Gavin and Stacey, living at Pam and Mick's house, run into trouble when Stacey struggles to find a job and becomes home-sick for Barry and her family. The couple try to overcome their problem by looking for an apartment or house in Essex, but Stacey is still dissatisfied and is considering moving back to South Wales to be with her family. In the final episode of the series, Stacey takes off her wedding ring, much to the upset of Gavin, but this is interrupted by the news of Nessa unexpectedly going into labour a month early. Pam, Mick and Stacey hurry across to Wales, whilst Gavin rushes to find Smithy with Smithy's sister, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Rudi Smith|Rudi]] ([[Sheridan Smith]]), eventually finding him in the pub watching football. They arrive to find that Nessa has given birth to a boy, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Neil, the baby|Neil]]. Gavin and Stacey decide to put their differences aside and are together once again.\n\n===Christmas special (2008)===\nAn extended Christmas special involves Stacey's family, along with Nessa and her partner, [[List of Gavin & Stacey characters#Dave Coaches|Dave Coaches]] ([[Steffan Rhodri]]), spending Christmas with Gavin's parents. Gavin reveals that he has found a job in Cardiff, which at first causes upset for Pam and Smithy, but they both learn to accept it. Gavin later admits to Smithy that he is moving to Barry with Stacey in order to save his marriage. Smithy also gets upset when he feels that Dave, who lives with the baby, Neil, is replacing him as a father. Smithy is furthermore unhappy after Dave proposes to Nessa (with the ring enclosed in a cigarette packet), and she accepts.\n\n===Series 3 (2009\u20132010)===\nGavin begins on his new job in Wales and his parents and Smithy travel to Wales for Neil's christening. In the next episode Gavin and Stacey, and Nessa and her child Neil, spend the weekend at Pam and Mick's, and after a drunken night, it is believed that Nessa and Smithy may have once again had sex after waking up in bed together the next morning. Gavin and Stacey begin trying for a baby and Stacey is upset and disappointed when she learns that they may not be able to have children. Gavin becomes depressed and preoccupied with this issue, and in an attempt to cheer him up, Pam, Mick and Smithy arrange a surprise trip to Barry beach on a sunny bank holiday. Nessa and Dave also run into trouble after Dave learns about her alleged sexual intercourse with Smithy, but the two decide to go ahead with the wedding. In the final episode, Stacey discovers she is pregnant after all, and the couple are overjoyed and excited. Smithy shows up at Nessa and Dave's wedding ceremony with Neil, pleading for her not to marry him, and accusing her of not loving Dave. Dave, much to everyone's surprise, agrees with Smithy that Nessa does not love him, and the ceremony is called off. The series ends showing the four (Gavin, Stacey, Nessa and Smithy) six months later on Barry beachfront, with a visibly pregnant Stacey.\n\n===Christmas special (2019)===\nIn May 2019, Corden announced that he and Jones had written a Christmas special. The programme aired on BBC One on 25 December 2019. The episode started off with Gavin and Stacey, who now have three children, and are living in Barry next door to Stacey's mum after Doris - who died several years before - left them the property in her will. Nessa and Smithy's child, Neil (known as \"Neil, the Baby\u201d) is now eleven. Smithy has started a new relationship with Sonia ([[Laura Aikman]]) and he plans to propose to her on Christmas Day. Gwen, Bryn & Jason join together to celebrate the holiday, together with Pam and Mick, who spent Christmas Eve with Dawn and Pete. At the end of the episode, Nessa tells Smithy that she loves him, and she [[Marriage proposal|proposes]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brydon.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rob Brydon]] plays Uncle Bryn]]\n[[File:You'll Have Had Your Tea - Alison Steadman.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Alison Steadman]] plays Pam Shipman]]\n\nThe idea for the show occurred to actor [[James Corden]] during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer [[Ruth Jones (actress)|Ruth Jones]], whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama ''[[Fat Friends]]''. Corden claims to have been inspired by the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play entitled It's My Day, but the BBC instead asked for a full series.<ref name=Times06March2008USRemake>{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3495129.ece|title=Gavin & Stacey to be given US remake|newspaper=The Times | date = 6 March 2008 | accessdate = 6 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to [[Mathew Horne]] and [[Joanna Page]] on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for [[Rob Brydon]], who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for [[Alison Steadman]], who had also worked on ''Fat Friends''. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom ''[[Nighty Night]]'', and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with [[Adrian Scarborough]] in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, ''[[The History Boys]]'', which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in ''The History Boys''.\n\nAlthough the programme is set in [[Billericay]], [[Essex]], and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[Vale of Glamorgan]], the three series were shot largely in [[Cardiff]] (which acted as the city itself but also as parts of Billericay), and also in Barry itself and the surrounding area, including [[Dinas Powys]], [[Sully, Vale of Glamorgan|Sully]] and [[Penarth]]. The show's popularity has been credited with boosting the tourist trade to Barry and its popular seafront of [[Barry Island]], through visitors wishing to visit the various filming locations.\nGavin's house was set in Billericay but was actually filmed on location in Laburnum Way, Dinas Powys in Wales. The opening episode features location shooting in [[Leicester Square]] in London which was filmed in 2006.\n<ref name=BarryTraders>{{cite web |url=http://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/news/latestnews/4837541.Barry_Island_traders___We_must_make_the_most_of_Gavin___Stacey_/ | title=Barry Island traders: 'We must make the most of Gavin & Stacey' |date=9 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Newsquest |work=Barry and District News}}</ref><ref name=BBCTownPlansTrail>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7405307.stm | title=Town plans Gavin and Stacey trail |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=WesternMailNewYearsDayHit>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/01/04/gavin-and-stacey-a-new-year-s-day-hit-91466-25520204/ | title=Gavin and Stacey a New Year's Day hit |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=16 January 2010 |publisher=Western Mail}}</ref>\n\nAfter the debut of the show on BBC Three, a second series was soon commissioned. Speaking about the second series, Corden said \"It's the show that we wanted to make. If people like it, they like it: if they don't, they don't. That's a nice feeling, that's quite freeing... There's more of a journey and more of a story. We hope the viewers will feel like they've been taken on a little trip by it\", while Jones said \"Series one had a very specific storyline to it, boy meets girl and it ends in a wedding. We don't have the same type of storyline in the second series.

In an April 2008 interview, Jones said \"We never intended to write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable.

He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|iron ore separator]], [[incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]], and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see [[Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps]]). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager [[Francis Robbins Upton]] turned out 50,000 lamps.

A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\n\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by [[Johann Philipp Reis]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]], worked by generating a weak current. The [[carbon microphone]] works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line.

On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]] generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers in lower [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=A brief history of Con Edison:\"Electricity\" |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] began service in [[Roselle, New Jersey]].\n\n===War of currents===\n{{Main|War of the currents}}\n[[File:PyramidParthenon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]].]]\nAs Edison expanded his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885\u20131886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House \u2013 2004, pp. 54\u201360</ref> Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\n\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As [[George Westinghouse]] installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''\"<ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'', Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2008, p. 257</ref> Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.<ref>''Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The Country'' By Jill Jonnes p. 146</ref> Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nq0Le9FfXlAC&pg=PT68&dq=Thomson+Houston+westinghouse+edison+1887#v=onepage&q=Thomson%20Houston%20westinghouse%20edison%201887&f=false|title=Edison to Enron|publisher=|isbn=978-1-118-19251-1|last1=Robert l. Bradley|first1=Jr|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House \u2013 2004, p. 143</ref><ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2009, pp. 139\u2013140</ref> Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of the currents|\"battle of currents\"]]. The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier [[J.P. Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]]. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.<ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2009, p. 268</ref><ref>Robert L.

Bush]] (1869\u20131948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kin\u00e9toscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in [[Austria-Hungary]], the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-\u00f6sterreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/stollwerck.htm |title=Martin Loiperdinger.

High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|Edison Ore Milling Company]], Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|title=Edison's Companies \u2013 The Edison Papers|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the [[Falconbridge, Greater Sudbury, Ontario|Falconbridge]] ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |work=[[Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910012726/http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |archivedate=September 10, 2010 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [[Edison Building (Falconbridge)|Edison Building]], which served as the head office of [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Mines]], are named for him.\n\n===Rechargeable battery===\n{{Further|Nickel\u2013iron battery#History}}\n[[File:Edison Storage Battery Company 1903.JPG|thumb|Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued 19. October 1903]]\nIn the late 1890s Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient [[rechargeable battery]] (at that time called an \"accumulator\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.<ref>David John Cole, Eve Browning, Eve Browning Cole, Fred E. H. Schroeder, Encyclopedia of Modern Everyday Inventions, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pages 45-46</ref> The then available [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead acid rechargeable batteries]] were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using [[alkali]]ne instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a [[nickel\u2013iron battery]] by the Swedish inventor [[Waldemar Jungner]].<ref name=\"Seth Fletcher 2011, pages 14-16\">Seth Fletcher, Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 10, 2011, pages 14-16</ref>\n\nEdison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel\u2013iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was spent, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel\u2013iron battery was never very successful, by the time it was ready electric cars were disappearing and lead acid batteries had become the standard for tuning over gas powered car [[Starter (engine)|starter motors]].<ref name=\"Seth Fletcher 2011, pages 14-16\"/>\n\n===Chemicals===\n\nAt the start of [[World War I]], the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August 1914, resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was [[phenol]], which was used to make [[phonograph]] records\u2014presumably as [[phenolic resins]] of the [[Bakelite]] type.\n\nAt the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of [[coke oven]] gases or [[manufactured gas]] for [[gas lighting]].  Phenol could be nitrated to [[picric acid]] and converted to [[ammonium picrate]], a shock resistant [[high explosive]] suitable for use in artillery shells.  The best telling{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} of the phenol story is found in ''The Aspirin Wars''.<ref>Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991). ''The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition''. Alfred A. Knopf, NY, {{ISBN|0-394-57894-5}}, pp. 38\u201340</ref> Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.\n\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, facility using processes developed by his chemists.<ref>Conot, Robert (1979), ''A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison'', Seaview Books, NY, pp. 413\u2013414</ref> He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and [[Bessemer, Alabama]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\nPhenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. [[Bakelite]], the original [[thermoset]] plastic, had been invented in 1909. [[Aspirin]], too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug. [[Bayer]] had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in [[Rensselaer, New York]], but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.\n\nBayer relied on [[Chemische Fabrik von Heyden]], in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]], to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See [[Great Phenol]] plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to [[salicylic acid]] by Heyden, some of which was exported.\n\n==Final years and death==\n===Final years===\n[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Ford]], Thomas Edison, and [[Harvey Firestone]], respectively. [[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929]]\n\n[[Henry Ford]], the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the [[DTE Electric Company|Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit]] and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. [[Harvey Firestone]] and naturalist [[John Burroughs]] also participated.\n\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [[Civitan International|Civitan Club]]. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things\u2014big things\u2014for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Armbrester |first= Margaret E. |title= The Civitan Story |year= 1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location= Birmingham, AL |page= 34 }}</ref> He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\n\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna Railroad]] inaugurated suburban electric train service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], and [[Gladstone, New Jersey]]. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to [[South Orange, NJ|South Orange]].<ref name=\"Holland 2001\">{{Holland-Classic}}</ref>\n\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984.

However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\" She also said that during one of his periodic \"great scientific adventures\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.<ref name=\"condensed1042\"/>\n\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906.

His basic point was that, if the Government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/>\n\nHe thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\".<ref>Edison, 1922</ref> In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, [[Henry Ford]], he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hammes |first1=D.L. |last2=Wills |first2=D.T.|title=Thomas Edison's Monetary Option|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|year=2006 |volume=28|issue=3|page=295|doi=10.1080/10427710600857773 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hammes |first=David L.|title=Harvesting Gold: Thomas Edison's Experiment to Re-Invent American Money|publisher=Mahler Publishing|date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n[[File:Abraham Archibald Anderson - Thomas Alva Edison - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Edison by [[Abraham Archibald Anderson]] (1890), [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]]]]\nThe [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Third Republic|Third French Republic]], [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]], on the recommendation of his [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Jules Barth\u00e9lemy-Saint-Hilaire]], and with the presentations of the [[Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Telephones (France)|Minister of Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Louis Adolphe Cochery|Louis Cochery]], designated Edison with the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur#The Order and other countries|''distinction'']] of an [[Legion of Honour|Officer of the Legion of Honour]] ([[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]) by decree on November 10, 1881;<ref>The same decree awarded German physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] with the designation of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, as well as [[Alexander Graham Bell]].

A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\n\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by [[Johann Philipp Reis]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]], worked by generating a weak current.

The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on [[Pearl Street Station]], New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]] generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts [[direct current]] (DC) to 59 customers in lower [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |title=A brief history of Con Edison:\"Electricity\" |publisher=Coned.com |date=January 1, 1998 |accessdate=December 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030164753/http://www.coned.com/history/electricity.asp |archivedate=October 30, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at [[Holborn Viaduct]] in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] began service in [[Roselle, New Jersey]].\n\n===War of currents===\n{{Main|War of the currents}}\n[[File:PyramidParthenon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]].]]\nAs Edison expanded his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885\u20131886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House \u2013 2004, pp. 54\u201360</ref> Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\n\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As [[George Westinghouse]] installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''\"<ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'', Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2008, p. 257</ref> Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.<ref>''Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The Country'' By Jill Jonnes p. 146</ref> Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nq0Le9FfXlAC&pg=PT68&dq=Thomson+Houston+westinghouse+edison+1887#v=onepage&q=Thomson%20Houston%20westinghouse%20edison%201887&f=false|title=Edison to Enron|publisher=|isbn=978-1-118-19251-1|last1=Robert l. Bradley|first1=Jr|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nParallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House \u2013 2004, p. 143</ref><ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2009, pp. 139\u2013140</ref> Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of the currents|\"battle of currents\"]]. The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier [[J.P. Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]]. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.<ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US \u2013 2009, p. 268</ref><ref>Robert L.

Despite the failure of his mining company, the [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|Edison Ore Milling Company]], Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|title=Edison's Companies \u2013 The Edison Papers|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the [[Falconbridge, Greater Sudbury, Ontario|Falconbridge]] ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |work=[[Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910012726/http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |archivedate=September 10, 2010 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [[Edison Building (Falconbridge)|Edison Building]], which served as the head office of [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Mines]], are named for him.\n\n===Rechargeable battery===\n{{Further|Nickel\u2013iron battery#History}}\n[[File:Edison Storage Battery Company 1903.JPG|thumb|Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued 19. October 1903]]\nIn the late 1890s Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient [[rechargeable battery]] (at that time called an \"accumulator\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.<ref>David John Cole, Eve Browning, Eve Browning Cole, Fred E. H. Schroeder, Encyclopedia of Modern Everyday Inventions, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pages 45-46</ref> The then available [[Lead\u2013acid battery|lead acid rechargeable batteries]] were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using [[Alkali|alkaline]] instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a [[nickel\u2013iron battery]] by the Swedish inventor [[Waldemar Jungner]].<ref>Seth Fletcher, Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 10, 2011, pages 14-16</ref>\n\nEdison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel\u2013iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was spent, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel\u2013iron battery was never very successful, by the time it was ready electric cars were disappearing and lead acid batteries had become the standard for tuning over gas powered car [[Starter (engine)|starter motors]].<ref>Seth Fletcher, Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 10, 2011, pages 14-16</ref>\n\n===Chemicals===\n\nAt the start of [[World War I]], the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August 1914, resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was [[phenol]], which was used to make [[phonograph]] records\u2014presumably as [[phenolic resins]] of the [[Bakelite]] type.\n\nAt the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of [[coke oven]] gases or [[manufactured gas]] for [[gas lighting]].  Phenol could be nitrated to [[picric acid]] and converted to [[ammonium picrate]], a shock resistant [[high explosive]] suitable for use in artillery shells.  The best telling{{According to whom|date=July 2019}} of the phenol story is found in ''The Aspirin Wars''.<ref>Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991). ''The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition''. Alfred A. Knopf, NY, {{ISBN|0-394-57894-5}}, pp. 38\u201340</ref> Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.\n\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake, facility using processes developed by his chemists.<ref>Conot, Robert (1979), ''A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison'', Seaview Books, NY, pp. 413\u2013414</ref> He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and [[Bessemer, Alabama]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the [[German dye trust]].  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and [[pyrax]].  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\nPhenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. [[Bakelite]], the original [[thermoset]] plastic, had been invented in 1909. [[Aspirin]], too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug. [[Bayer]] had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in [[Rensselaer, New York]], but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.\n\nBayer relied on [[Chemische Fabrik von Heyden]], in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]], to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See [[Great Phenol]] plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to [[salicylic acid]] by Heyden, some of which was exported.\n\n==Final years and death==\n===Final years===\n[[File:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Ford]], Thomas Edison, and [[Harvey Firestone]], respectively. [[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929]]\n\n[[Henry Ford]], the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the [[DTE Electric Company|Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit]] and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. [[Harvey Firestone]] and naturalist [[John Burroughs]] also participated.\n\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [[Civitan International|Civitan Club]]. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things\u2014big things\u2014for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Armbrester |first= Margaret E. |title= The Civitan Story |year= 1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location= Birmingham, AL |page= 34 }}</ref> He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\n\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna Railroad]] inaugurated suburban electric train service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], and [[Gladstone, New Jersey]]. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to [[South Orange, NJ|South Orange]].<ref name=\"Holland 2001\">{{Holland-Classic}}</ref>\n\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by [[New Jersey Transit]].<ref name=\"Holland 2001\"/>\n\nEdison was said to have been influenced by a popular [[Food faddism|fad diet]] in his last few years; \"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\".<ref name=\"Israel\">{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Israel (historian)|title=Edison: A Life of Invention|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-36270-8}}</ref> He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \"correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\" She also said that during one of his periodic \"great scientific adventures\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.<ref name=\"condensed1042\"/>\n\nEdison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906.

During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, [[Henry Ford]], he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals.

Many people [[ethics of eating meat|object to eating meat]] out of respect for [[Sentience|sentient]] life. Such ethical motivations have been codified [[vegetarianism and religion|under various religious beliefs]], as well as [[animal rights]] advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, [[Environmental vegetarianism|environmental]], cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[Economic vegetarianism|economic]], or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]] diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an [[ovo-vegetarian]] diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a [[lacto-vegetarian]] diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A strict vegetarian diet \u2013 referred to as ''[[vegan]]'' \u2013 excludes all [[animal product]]s, including eggs and dairy.

This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1\u20131/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.<ref>Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center, ''[http://www.llu.edu/pages/news/today/july2601/llu.html New Adventist Health Study research noted in Archives of Internal Medicine]'', Loma Linda University, July 26, 2001.

The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (\u2265 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PN, Sabat\u00e9 J, Fraser GE | title = Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 526S\u2013532S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936945 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.526S }}</ref>\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing [[life expectancy]] with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant [[Mediterranean diet]] is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Trichopoulou A, Orfanos P, Norat T, Bueno-de-Mesquita B, Ock\u00e9 MC, Peeters PH, van der Schouw YT, Boeing H, Hoffmann K, Boffetta P, Nagel G, Masala G, Krogh V, Panico S, Tumino R, Vineis P, Bamia C, Naska A, Benetou V, Ferrari P, Slimani N, Pera G, Martinez-Garcia C, Navarro C, Rodriguez-Barranco M, Dorronsoro M, Spencer EA, Key TJ, Bingham S, Khaw KT, Kesse E, Clavel-Chapelon F, Boutron-Ruault MC, Berglund G, Wirfalt E, Hallmans G, Johansson I, Tjonneland A, Olsen A, Overvad K, Hundborg HH, Riboli E, Trichopoulos D | title = Modified Mediterranean diet and survival: EPIC-elderly prospective cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7498 | page = 991 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15820966 | pmc = 557144 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38415.644155.8F | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050425111008.htm  }}</ref>\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region.

In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practices involved in the processing of animals for food. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]]. Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.\n\n=== Ethics of killing for food ===\n{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\nEthical vegetarians believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindeman M., V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen M. | year = 2000 | title = Measurement of ethical food choice motives | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 55\u201359 | doi = 10.1006/appe.1999.0293 | pmid = 10744892 }}</ref> Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103\u2013112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}</ref> [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious.

Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1\u20131/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women.

The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (\u2265 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh PN, Sabat\u00e9 J, Fraser GE | title = Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 526S\u2013532S | year = 2003 | pmid = 12936945 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/78.3.526S }}</ref>\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing [[life expectancy]] with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant [[Mediterranean diet]] is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Trichopoulou A, Orfanos P, Norat T, Bueno-de-Mesquita B, Ock\u00e9 MC, Peeters PH, van der Schouw YT, Boeing H, Hoffmann K, Boffetta P, Nagel G, Masala G, Krogh V, Panico S, Tumino R, Vineis P, Bamia C, Naska A, Benetou V, Ferrari P, Slimani N, Pera G, Martinez-Garcia C, Navarro C, Rodriguez-Barranco M, Dorronsoro M, Spencer EA, Key TJ, Bingham S, Khaw KT, Kesse E, Clavel-Chapelon F, Boutron-Ruault MC, Berglund G, Wirfalt E, Hallmans G, Johansson I, Tjonneland A, Olsen A, Overvad K, Hundborg HH, Riboli E, Trichopoulos D | title = Modified Mediterranean diet and survival: EPIC-elderly prospective cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7498 | page = 991 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15820966 | pmc = 557144 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38415.644155.8F | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050425111008.htm  }}</ref>\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region.

In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural [[taboo]], such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as [[factory farms]], or avoid certain meats, such as [[veal]] or [[foie gras]]. Some people follow vegetarian or [[Veganism|vegan]] diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practices involved in the processing of animals for food. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant [[protein]]. Ethical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain [[Intensive farming|agricultural practices]] surrounding the [[animal husbandry|production]] of meat.\n\n=== Ethics of killing for food ===\n{{POV section|2018|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|Bioethics}}\nEthical vegetarians believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, especially one who has equal or lesser cognitive abilities than the animals in question, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or [[nutrition]] value is not a sufficient cause.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lindeman M., V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen M. | year = 2000 | title = Measurement of ethical food choice motives | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 55\u201359 | doi = 10.1006/appe.1999.0293 | pmid = 10744892 }}</ref> Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behavior in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Why the Naive Argument against Moral Vegetarianism Really is Naive|journal=Environmental Values|year=2001|pages=103\u2013112|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.3197/096327101129340769|author=David Benatar}}</ref> [[Jeff McMahan (philosopher)|Jeff McMahan]] proposes that denying the right to life and humane treatment to animals with equal or greater cognitive abilities than mentally disabled humans is an arbitrary and discriminatory practice based on habit instead of logic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McMahan|first1=Jeff|title=The Ethics of Killing|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not [[Moral equivalence|moral equals]] to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious.

According to the [[Worldwatch Institute]], \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate.

The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]].

51 Raid''', was an American [[Facebook event]] that took place on September 20, 2019, at [[Area 51]], a [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) facility within the [[Nevada Test and Training Range]]. The event, created by Matty Roberts on June 27, 2019, would involve raiding the site in a search for [[extraterrestrial life]]. More than 2 million people responded \"going\" and 1.5 million \"interested\" on the event's page, which subsequently attracted widespread media reaction and caused the event to become an [[Internet meme]]. Roberts later stated that the event was purely comedic, and disavowed responsibility for any casualties were there any actual attempts to raid the military base.\n\nOn the day of the event, only about 150 people were reported to have shown up at the entrance to Area 51, with none succeeding in entering the site. Two [[music festival]]s were planned to coincide with the event: Alienstock in [[Rachel, Nevada]] and Storm Area 51 Basecamp in [[Hiko, Nevada]]. An estimated 1,500 people attended these festivals, according to state and local law enforcement. Air Force spokeswoman Laura McAndrews stated government officials were briefed on the event and discouraged people from attempting to enter military property. [[Nevada]] [[law enforcement]] also warned potential participants in the event against [[Trespass to land#United States|trespassing]]. The event had an effect on businesses both locally in Nevada and around the United States, which prepared products for visitors and those attending the event.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Area 51|UFO conspiracy theory|Bob Lazar}}\n[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|[[Warning sign]] near Area 51 (2003)|alt=]]\nArea 51 has been the subject of many [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding the presence of aliens on the site.
