Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum.

[[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test.

Those that could not bring cash with them to the church were sent banking details of a company, Rising Estates, the directors of which are Bushiri lieutenants, Willah Mudolo, Duncan Oduor Otieno and Kit Ching Catherine Kum. Almost two years later, the people who gave Bushiri money claim to have not received anything back.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mashego |first1=Abram |title=\u2018Robbed\u2019 from the pulpit: How Bushiri conned investors out of millions |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/robbed-from-the-pulpit-how-bushiri-conned-investors-out-of-millions-20190225 |website=City Press |publisher=News24.com |accessdate=1 March 2019 |date=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe investment scheme appears to be linked to Palambano Investments as six congregants from Bushiri's church claim they were told that the money they donated would be invested in Zambia in \"gold minerals\" as part of a Palamabo investment scheme. The congregants provided proof that the money had been paid into the ECG's First National Bank account. [[East London, Eastern Cape]], police spokesperson Capt Mluleki Mbi confirmed that a case had been opened against Palambano Investments and its directors in response to a complaint by Nombeko Dwesini, one of Bushiri's congregants.<ref name=\"Fuzile 2019\">{{cite web | last=Fuzile | first=Bongani | title=Major One Bushiri 'duped us with gold scam' | website=TimesLIVE | date=10 February 2019 | url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/news/2019-02-10-major-one-bushiri-duped-us-with-gold-scam/ | access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Paternity ===\nIt is alleged that in 2010 Bushiri impregnated a teenage Malawian woman, whom he met in 2007 in their home town, Mzimba. It is further claimed that he bribed her with a cheque for {{val|80000|fmt=gaps}} Malawian kwacha (about R{{val|1500|fmt=gaps}}) to have an abortion but that the cheque bounced. The woman subsequently gave birth in 2011 to a girl who \"is the spitting image of Bushiri and it is widely known in the district that he is the biological father,\u201d according to the father of the woman. The woman is now married and the family alleges that they \"kept quiet out of fear.\" The village that the woman and child live in broke the news before the family approached Bushiri. Bushiri claims that the cheque was stolen from him and that, on the day the woman claims he made her pregnant, Bushiri was at a police station dealing with an attempted hijacking. In 2018, the mother again tried to get maintenance via the courts but was unsuccessful. Family members of the girl claim that Bushiri admits to the allegations in private, despite his public denials and have demanded a paternity test. His lawyer, Terrence Baloyi, did not respond to emails, text messages and calls from City Press seeking comment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makhoba |first1=Ntombizodwa |title=Bushiri\u2019s hidden baby: Family says he tried to bribe woman to have abortion {{!}} City Press |url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/bushiris-hidden-baby-family-says-he-tried-to-bribe-woman-to-have-abortion-20190311 |website=News 24 |publisher=City Press |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-payment for clothing ===\nDarlington Manyawu, a businessman based in Hong Kong, claims to have sold Bushiri clothing to the value of R{{val|450000|fmt=gaps}} but had not received payment for them.

{"title_page": "Superman in film", "text_new": "{{short description|Film adaptations of the DC Comics superhero Superman}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe fictional character [[Superman]], an [[American comic book]] superhero in [[DC Comics]] publications, has appeared in various films almost since his inception. He debuted in cinemas in a series of [[animated shorts]] beginning in 1941, and then starred in two [[movie serials]] in 1948 and 1950. An independent studio, [[Lippert Pictures]], released the first Superman feature film, ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', starring [[George Reeves]], in 1951.\n[[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] and [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]] purchased the ''Superman'' [[film rights]] in 1974. After numerous scripts, [[Richard Donner]] was hired to direct the film, filming ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980) simultaneously. Donner had already shot eighty percent of ''Superman II'' with [[Christopher Reeve]] before it was decided to finish shooting the first film. The Salkinds fired Donner after ''Superman''{{'}}s release and commissioned [[Richard Lester]] as the director to finish ''Superman II''. Lester also returned for ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), and the Salkinds further produced the related 1984 spin-off ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' before selling the rights to [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], resulting in the poorly reviewed ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987). Ilya Salkind commissioned a fifth ''Superman'' script before Warner Bros. acquired the rights entirely in 1993.\n\nOver the course of eleven years, Warner Bros. would develop and then cancel [[Tim Burton]]'s ''Superman Lives'', which would have starred [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''Batman vs. Superman'', and the [[J. J. Abrams]] scripted ''Superman: Flyby'', which went between directors [[McG|Joseph \"McG\" Nichols]] and [[Brett Ratner]]. The studio hired [[Bryan Singer]] to take over the films in 2004, releasing ''[[Superman Returns]]'' in 2006, which starred newcomer [[Brandon Routh]]. Donner's [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|director's cut for ''Superman II'']] was also released that year. Despite positive reviews, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the financial performance of ''Superman Returns'', and canceled Singer's proposed sequel. The studio nearly went into production of a [[Justice League]] film with [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] directing and [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, but it was shelved in 2008 and the film series was [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed in 2013 with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', directed by [[Zack Snyder]] with [[Henry Cavill]] starring as Superman. Snyder and Cavill worked together again in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n==Films==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!

The first occurred on May 1, 2001, when ''The Complete Superman Collection'' was released both on DVD and [[VHS]], containing that year's DVD/home video releases of ''Superman'', ''Superman II'', ''Superman III'', and ''Superman IV''. The set was valued at US$49.99 for the DVD release and US$29.99 for the VHS release, and received positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,108170,00.html|title=The Complete Superman Collection (2001)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-12-31|date=May 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe four Christopher Reeve films were again released on November 28, 2006, in new DVD releases to coincide with ''[[Superman Returns]]'', also released in that year. ''Superman'' was released in a four-disc '[[special edition]]' similar to ''Superman II'', which was released in a two-disc special edition. Both ''Superman III'' and ''IV'' were released in single disc '[[deluxe edition]]s', and all four releases were available together in ''The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection'', an 8-disc set that was valued at US$79.92.

All contents of the set were housed within a [[tin]] case.

The first was that the 2.0 audio track on ''Superman'', was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the ''Superman III'' disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE1fU162IXA442|title=Warner Bros.

The collection was a 2-disc [[DVD-9|DVD-18]] set that included the first disc of both special editions from the 2006 release and both deluxe editions.\n\nOn April 1, 2011, it was announced that the entire Superman anthology would be making its way to [[Blu-ray]] for the first time.

He debuted in cinemas in a series of [[animated shorts]] beginning in 1941, and then starred in two [[movie serials]] in 1948 and 1950. An independent studio, [[Lippert Pictures]], released the first Superman feature film, ''[[Superman and the Mole Men]]'', starring [[George Reeves]], in 1951.\n[[Ilya Salkind|Ilya]] and [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Pierre Spengler]] purchased the ''Superman'' [[film rights]] in 1974. After numerous scripts, [[Richard Donner]] was hired to direct the film, filming ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978) and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980) simultaneously. Donner had already shot eighty percent of ''Superman II'' with [[Christopher Reeve]] before it was decided to finish shooting the first film. The Salkinds fired Donner after ''Superman''{{'}}s release and commissioned [[Richard Lester]] as the director to finish ''Superman II''. Lester also returned for ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), and the Salkinds further produced the related 1984 spin-off ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' before selling the rights to [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], resulting in the poorly reviewed ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987). Ilya Salkind commissioned a fifth ''Superman'' script before Warner Bros. acquired the rights entirely in 1993.\n\nOver the course of eleven years, Warner Bros. would develop and then cancel [[Tim Burton]]'s ''Superman Lives'', which would have starred [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''Batman vs. Superman'', and the [[J.

The studio hired [[Bryan Singer]] to take over the films in 2004, releasing ''[[Superman Returns]]'' in 2006, which starred newcomer [[Brandon Routh]]. Donner's [[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut|director's cut for ''Superman II'']] was also released that year. Despite positive reviews, Warner Bros. was disappointed with the financial performance of ''Superman Returns'', and canceled Singer's proposed sequel. The studio nearly went into production of a [[Justice League]] film with [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] directing and [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, but it was shelved in 2008 and the film series was [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed in 2013 with ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', directed by [[Zack Snyder]] with [[Henry Cavill]] starring as Superman.

Before Kata-Zor sentences Jor-El to prison, Kal-El is launched to Earth to fulfill a prophecy. Adopted by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], he forms a romance with [[Lois Lane]] in the ''[[Daily Planet]]''. However, Lois is more concerned with exposing [[Lex Luthor]], written as a government agent obsessed with [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] phenomena. Clark reveals himself to the world as Superman, bringing Kata-Zor's son, Ty-Zor, and three other Kryptonians to Earth. Superman is defeated and killed, and visits Jor-El (who committed suicide on Krypton while in prison) in Kryptonian heaven. Resurrected, he returns to Earth and defeats the four Kryptonians. The script ends with Superman flying off to Krypton in a spaceship.<ref name=White/>\n\n[[Brett Ratner]] was hired to direct in September 2002, originally expressing an interest in casting an unknown for the lead role, while filming was to start sometime in late 2003.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stax|title=Ratner Talks 'Superman'|website=IGN|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/371/371260p1.html|date=September 17, 2002|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> [[Christopher Reeve]] joined as project consultant, citing [[Tom Welling]], who portrayed the teenage [[Clark Kent]] in ''[[Smallville]]'', as an ideal candidate.

The first occurred on May 1, 2001, when ''The Complete Superman Collection'' was released both on DVD and [[VHS]], containing that year's DVD/home video releases of ''Superman'', ''Superman II'', ''Superman III'', and ''Superman IV''. The set was valued at US$49.99 for the DVD release and US$29.99 for the VHS release, and received positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,108170,00.html|title=The Complete Superman Collection (2001)|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-12-31|date=May 4, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe four Christopher Reeve films were again released on November 28, 2006, in new DVD releases to coincide with ''[[Superman Returns]]'', also released in that year. ''Superman'' was released in a four-disc '[[special edition]]' similar to ''Superman II'', which was released in a two-disc special edition. Both ''Superman III'' and ''IV'' were released in single disc '[[deluxe edition]]s', and all four releases were available together in ''The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection'', an 8-disc set that was valued at US$79.92. Like the 2001 set before it, ''The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection'' received positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16168 |title=The Christopher Reeve Superman Collection DVD Review|publisher=UGO.com |accessdate=2008-12-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214040526/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=16168|archivedate=February 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlso on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled ''Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition'' was released, containing ''Superman'', ''Superman II'', ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', ''Superman III'', ''Superman IV'', ''Superman Returns'', and ''[[Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman]]'', among other releases. All contents of the set were housed within a [[tin]] case.

The first was that the 2.0 audio track on ''Superman'', was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the ''Superman III'' disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. The set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE1fU162IXA442|title=Warner Bros.

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E. Foot]], an Englishman who had spent nine years as a science master at [[Eton College]], England.<ref>{{cite book|year=1979|chapter=FOOT, Arthur Edward|title=Who Was Who 1961\u20131970|location=London|publisher=A. & C.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

Colonel Lister retaliated in 1850, with the co-operation of the Thadou tribe, an event historically called the ''First British invasion'', burning down a Lusei village of 800 tribal houses and freeing 400 Thadou captives.<ref name=cnun2/><ref>Lalrinnunga Hmar (2010), MIGRATION AND SOCIAL FORMATION OF THE MIZO, Ph.D. Thesis (Awarded), THE NORTH EASTER HILL UNIVERSITY SHILLONG, Chapter 5, pages 115-140</ref> British historical records on the Mizo Hills state similar inter-ethnic tribal raids for loot, slaves and retaliatory battles continued for decades.<ref name=misai/>\n\nThe Mizo Hills formally became part of [[British India]] in 1895, and practices such as head-hunting were banned in Mizoram as well as neighbouring regions.<ref>Ved Prakash (2007), Encyclopaedia of North-East India, Vol. 1 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0703-8}}), 4 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0706-9}}) & 5 ({{ISBN|978-81-269-0707-6}})</ref> The northern and southern Mizo Hills became the Lushai Hills, with Aizawl as their headquarters by declaring the whole area as Excluded Area till India got independence from the British.<ref>[http://mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm Mizoram History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721173040/http://www.mizoram.nic.in/about/history.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}, National Informatics Centre, Government of India (2012)</ref> At the time of the British conquest, there were around 60 chiefs.<ref name=\"Suhas1995\"/> After Christian missionaries arrived with the gospel, the majority of the population became Christians in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n===Post 1947===\nBy the time India gained independence from the British Empire, the number of tribal chiefs had increased to over 200.

Mizo people are spread throughout the [[Northeast India|northeastern states of India]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], and [[Bangladesh]]. They belong to numerous tribes; however, to name a particular tribe as the largest is difficult as no concrete census has ever been undertaken.\n\nSometime in the 16th century CE, the first batch of Mizo crossed Tiau river and settled in Mizoram and they were called as [[Kuki people|Kukis]] by [[Bengalis]].<ref name=lsmgov/> The term Kuki mean the inhabitants of the interior and inaccessible mountain tracts. Sometimes grouped as [[Kuki-Chin-Mizo people|Kuki-Chin]] tribes, The First batch were called Old Kukis which are the [[Biate people|Biate]] and the [[Hrangkhol people|Hrangkhol]] and the second batch that followed include [[Lushei]] (or Lusei), [[Paite people|Paite]], [[Lai people|Lai]], [[Mara people|Mara]], [[Ralte people|Ralte]], [[Hmar people|Hmar]], [[Thadou people|Thadou]], Shendus, and several other.<ref name=lsmgov>[http://landrevenue.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/historical-evolution-of-mizoram.pdf THE LAND SYSTEMS OF MIZORAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155933/http://landrevenue.mizoram.gov.in/uploads/files/historical-evolution-of-mizoram.pdf |date=14 July 2014 }}, Govt of Mizoram (2007)</ref> These tribes are subdivided into numerous clans, and these clans are further sub-divided into sub-clans, for example the Hmars are divided into Thiek, [[Saihriem people|Faihriem]], Lungtau, Darngawn, Khawbung, Zote and others.

The [[Bru people|Bru]] ([[Reang language|Reang]]), [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]], origin of Northern [[Arakan Mountains|Arakan Mountain]], are some non-Kuki tribes of Mizoram, with some suggestion that some of these are [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] in their origins.<ref name=lsmgov/> The [[Bnei Menashe]] tribe claim [[Jews|Jewish]] descent.<ref name=mzote>Zote, Mona (2005), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006028 Heaven in Hell: A paradox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913002342/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23006028 |date=13 September 2018 }}, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 2/3, pp 203-212.</ref>\n\nThe diversity of tribal groups reflects the historical immigration patterns. Different tribes and sub-tribes arrived in the present Mizoram, in successive waves and settled down in different parts of the state. Further, as they arrived, there were raids, fear of raids and intertribal feuds. The resulting isolation and separation created numerous tribes and sub-tribes.<ref name=lsmgov/> The Mizo people usually suffix their descriptive given names with their tribe.\n\nOther than tribal groups, other ethnic groups inhabit Mizoram. For example, [[Gurkha|Nepali Gorkhas]] were encouraged to settle in [[Aizawl]] area and other parts of Mizoram during the British colonial times.

In 1898, the southern part was transferred from Bengal to Assam. The colonial power retained the chiefs and Mizo customs, including the socially stratified hereditary transfer of political power. In 1937, under Section 6 of the Scheduled District Act, the British administration<ref name=misai/> consolidated executive and legislative political power to the [[Deputy Commissioner (India)|Deputy Commissioner]] and [[District magistrate|District Magistrates]], with village chiefs in advisory role. The political and judiciary powers of chiefs were neither final nor exclusive, thereafter. Rulings could be appealed to courts staffed with British officials. After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.<ref name=misai/> In the same year the [[Young Mizo Association]] was formed which is still an important institution in Mizoram.\n\nThe representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the [[Mizo Union]] pleaded with the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]] with the District Council in Assam.

Contemporary people of Mizoram celebrate Christmas, Easter and other Christian celebrations replacing many of old tribal customs and practices.\n\nThe growth of Christianity, scholars state,<ref>Z. Hlawndo, A STUDY OF THE CULTURAL FACTORS IN THE FOREIGN MISSIONS THINKING OF THE MIZORAM PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Ph.D. Thesis (Awarded), University of Birmingham (2011)</ref> was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure. One such foundation cultural element of Mizo people was ''Hnatlang'', states Hlawndo, which literally means social work, united labour or community labour (the word hna\u2018 means job or work in the Mizo language; and tlang\u2018 means together and mutual). The tribal members who were absent from such social work (for reasons other than illness and disability) were penalised \u2014 a form of strong peer pressure. Jhum cultivation and raids on neighbouring tribes required ''Hnatlang'', the spirit of united labour and equal sharing of the end result.\n\nA consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of ''Tlawmngaihna'', which does not have a direct English translation. ''Tlawmngaihna'' as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.<ref>James Dokhuma, \"Tlawmngaihna\" in Meichher, Vol XI, No. 11, April 1976</ref><ref name=nepa>Nevill Parry, {{Google books|ZZsJAQAAIAAJ|Lushai Custom: A monograph on customs and ceremonies}}</ref><ref>K.

The man and the woman could have many partners. If the woman got pregnant, the man was required either marry or pay a substantial sum called ''Sawnman''. If the woman's parents discover the relationship, they had a right to demand a payment called ''Khumpuikaiman''.

These festivals slowly disappeared as Christianity became established in Mizoram.\n\n[[Chapchar Kut]] was reintroduced and revived in 1973 by Mizo people to celebrate their heritage. Before Christianity arrived in Mizoram, home-brewed alcohol and many meat delicacies were part of the Chapchar celebrations.

'Mizo' is the name used to call the native inhabitants and 'Ram' means 'land'. There is dispute on the term 'zo'. According to one view, 'zo' means 'highland' (or hill) and Mizoram means 'land of the Mizos'. B.

The general geology of western Mizoram consists of repetitive succession of Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Surma Group and Tipam Formation such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and rare pockets of shell limestone.

It originates in Chin state in Burma and passes through [[Saiha district|Saiha]] and [[Lawngtlai district|Lawngtlai]] districts in the southern tip of Mizoram, goes back to Burma's Rakhine state. Although many more rivers and streams drain the hill ranges, the most important and useful rivers are the [[Tlawng]], [[Tut River|Tut]], [[Tuirial River|Tuirial]] and [[Tuivawl River|Tuivawl]] which flow through the northern territory and eventually join the [[Barak River]] in [[Cachar District]].

Legend has it that a huge [[mustard plant]] once stood in this place. When the plant was cut down, jets of water sprayed from the plant and created a pool of water, thus the lake was named \u0162am Dil which means of 'lake of mustard plant'. Today the lake is an important tourist attraction and a holiday resort. The most significant lake in Mizo history, [[Rih Lake|Rih Dil]], is ironically located in Burma, a few kilometres from the Indo-Burma border. It was believed that departed souls pass through this lake before making their way to [[Pialral]] or heaven.

After India gained independence from the colonial rule, the region was granted autonomous status in 1952, where Mizo people formulated their own laws and delivered judicial decisions. The region was renamed as Mizo District within Assam State in April 1954 and in that year, the institution of hereditary chieftainship was abolished, and instead village courts/council were set up.<ref name=misai/> In the same year the [[Young Mizo Association]] was formed which is still an important institution in Mizoram.\n\nThe representatives of the Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council and the [[Mizo Union]] pleaded with the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] (SRC) to integrate the Mizo-dominated areas of [[Tripura]] and [[Manipur]] with the District Council in Assam.

Contemporary people of Mizoram celebrate Christmas, Easter and other Christian celebrations replacing many of old tribal customs and practices.\n\nThe growth of Christianity, scholars state,<ref>Z. Hlawndo, A STUDY OF THE CULTURAL FACTORS IN THE FOREIGN MISSIONS THINKING OF THE MIZORAM PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Ph.D. Thesis (Awarded), University of Birmingham (2011)</ref> was shaped from a foundation of cultural, religious and socio-political structure. One such foundation cultural element of Mizo people was ''Hnatlang'', states Hlawndo, which literally means social work, united labour or community labour (the word hna\u2018 means job or work in the Mizo language; and tlang\u2018 means together and mutual). The tribal members who were absent from such social work (for reasons other than illness and disability) were penalised \u2014 a form of strong peer pressure. Jhum cultivation and raids on neighbouring tribes required ''Hnatlang'', the spirit of united labour and equal sharing of the end result.\n\nA consequence of Hnatlang was the culture of ''Tlawmngaihna'', which does not have a direct English translation. ''Tlawmngaihna'' as cultural concept incorporates behaviour that is self-sacrificing, self-denying, doing what an occasion demands unselfishly and without concern for inconvenience caused, persevering, stoical, stout-hearted, plucky, brave, firm, independent, loath to lose one's good reputation.<ref>James Dokhuma, \"Tlawmngaihna\" in Meichher, Vol XI, No. 11, April 1976</ref><ref name=nepa>Nevill Parry, {{Google books|ZZsJAQAAIAAJ|Lushai Custom: A monograph on customs and ceremonies}}</ref><ref>K.
