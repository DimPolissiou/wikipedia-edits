Although she painted in both watercolour and oil, and a mix of interiors, figures, portraits, still life and flower studies. \nShe is part of the famous Boyd Artistic Dynasty, a well known Australian artist family, which began with Emma and her husband Arthur and the work that they created that impacted and influenced their children and grandchildren to also take up the arts and pursue artistic careers.\n\n== Early Life ==\nEmma Minnie Boyd, nee \u00e0 Beckett was born in Melbourne in on 23 November 1958. She was the second child of her parents [[William Arthur \u00e0 Beckett]] and Emma Mills \u00e0 Beckett. Her mother Emma Mills \u00e0 Beckett was the Heiress of the John Mills fortune. Emma Minnie Boyd was known by her second name \u201cMinnie\u201d so as not to be confused for her mother. Partly thanks to her mother\u2019s fortune, Emma Minnie Boyd lived a very comfortable life with her family, growing up in Melbourne. From an early age she showed an interest in the arts, painting and drawing particularly. Her family would indulge her by posing for her early portraits. Her parents were well off and supporters of the arts. They encouraged her talents and were able to support her and give her a happy and privileged childhood. She studied at the National Gallery of Victoria School and exhibited regularly while studying.\n\n== Marriage==\n[[File:Boyd-Interior.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Interior with Figures, The Grange]]\nShe married Arthur Merric Boyd in 1886. He was born in New Zealand in 1862 and was the son of a Naval officer, he was also an aspiring artist. His family moved to Melbourne in the mid-1870s where Arthur Merric Boyd began to train as a painter but without the same familial support that his wife received from her family. They met while they were at art school together. It was fortunate for Arthur Merric Boyd that he married into a wealthy family. His own parents would have been unable to support him as making a good living as an artist, especially with his own family to look after, would have been difficult. The \u00e0 Beckett's were able to give the young couple and their children the means to pursue careers in the arts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Naill |first1=Brenda |title=the Boyds: a family biography |date=2002 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne}}</ref> \n\nTogether Arthur and Minnie had five children, Gilbert born 1886, who was tragically killed in a fall from a horse in 1896, [[Merric Boyd]] born 1888, [[Penleigh Boyd]] 1890, [[Martin Boyd]] in 1893, and her youngest and only daughter Helen 1903. All her children were involved in the arts, including Helen who became a painter. After her marriage Emma Minnie and Arthur Merric Boyd continued to receive support from her family. They moved into one of the family homes, The Grange, where they began raising their own family. As a woman who was well off, she had nannies to help her with the children and servants to help her with the house, duties expected of women in this time. This allowed her to continue to work even after starting a family.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Boyd-Lassie.jpg|thumb|200px|A Lassie Yet]]\nEmma Minnie Boyd was a prolific painter and exhibited her work frequently. She was one of the more versatile Australian artists and her work was varied. She was a contemporary of Artists like [[James Conder]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] and her work was exhibited alongside theirs. Both the Boyd\u2019s were acquainted with the artists who worked at the Heidelberg School but family and circumstance prevented them from also taking part. As a newly married couple they would be expected to set up house together and see about starting a family, it would not have been appropriate for them to be gallivanting across the countryside with a group of other painters. Because of this it is possible that both their careers could have suffered without the professional relationships and recognition the Heidelberg school achieved with the public.  \n\nEmma Minnie Boyd also worked with Louis Buvelot, with whom she shared a facility for landscape watercolour \u201cand a cautious tonal impressionism, with its persistent echoes of the Dutch school.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobrez |first1=Patricia |last2=Herbst |first2=Peter |title=The Art of the Boyds: Generations of Artistic Achievement |date=1990 |publisher=Bay Books |location=Sydney |page=30}}</ref>  In 1890 the Boyd\u2019s went to Europe to work, with their two young sons, where their work was shown at the Royal academy of the Arts, Boyd made several works during her time there. she was a religious woman and painted many of her social conscience works overseas. The loss of family investments in the crash of the Melbourne land boom brought Emma and her husband back to Melbourne, where she taught art students in her city studio.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first= Jane|title = Emma Minnie Boyd: 1858\u20131936 | year= 2004|publisher= Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery}}\n</ref>\n\nHer work ''Interior with figures, The Grange'' 1875 shows her talent for watercolour. Painted when she was just sixteen it is a snapshot of Australian life. The large bay window is shaded by galvanised iron typical of Australian homes of the period. The interior is relaxed, with the window opened.  A young Man sits on the window ledge not quite inside or outside the room, his companion, a young woman is seated inside, sewing. There is a relaxed atmosphere with the messy sewing box and two cats playing by a chair to the left of the painting. The spatial relationship of the kittens imitates that of the man and the woman. It comments on the relaxed atmosphere and social obligations that were a part of colonial society in Australia. Even during Victorian times social standards and decorum was not as strict as it was in Britain<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobrez |first1=Patricia |last2=Herbst |first2=peter |title=The Art of the Boyds: Generations of Artistic achievement |date=1990 |publisher=bay Books |location=Sydney |pages=28}}</ref>.    \n\nShe painted many watercolour landscape paintings of the Australian Bush; these works were popular with the public because the Australian landscape is quite unique to Australia and it represented a sense of national pride leading up to federation in 1901.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Impressionism |url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/australianimpressionism/education/insights_national.html |website=National Gallery of Victoria |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nShe died at Sandringham on 13 September 1936, survived by two of her sons and her daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\nFor many years she has been documented only as the mother of significant artists [[Penleigh Boyd]] and [[Merric Boyd]] and novelist [[Martin Boyd]] (her daughter Helen Read was also a prolific artist), and grandmother of [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Guy Boyd (sculptor)|Guy Boyd]] but she was one of the most prolific and consistent women artists of her generation in Melbourne, with a career that significantly outlasted that of [[Jane Sutherland]], for example. Emma Minnie Boyd's art was shown in its own right as works of historical and curatorial merit in the 1992\u20131993 touring exhibition ''Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg School'', at the [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]] and elsewhere, and in a retrospective in 2004 at the [[Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery]].\n\n==Selected paintings==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=175>\nFile:Boyd-Harkaway.jpg|[[Harkaway, Victoria|Harkaway]] Landscape\nFile:Boyd-Workhouse.jpg|To the Workhouse\nFile:Boyd-Load.jpg|The Last Load\nFile:Boyd-Martha.jpg|Near [[Mount Martha]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\nHammond, V & Peers, J 1992, ''Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg Era'', Artmores, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia.\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Emma Minnie Boyd}}\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/emma-minnie-abeckett-boyd/ More works by Boyd] @ ArtNet\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boyd, Emma Minnie}}\n[[Category:1858 births]]\n[[Category:1936 deaths]]\n[[Category:Australian women painters]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg School]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian artists]]\n[[Category:Australian Impressionist painters]]\n[[Category:Boyd family|Emma Minnie]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian women]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian women]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=March 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n{{Infobox person\n| honorific_prefix = \n| name             = Emma Boyd \n| honorific_suffix = \n| image            = <!-- just the pagename, without the File:/Image: prefix or [[brackets]] -->\n| image_size       = \n| alt              = \n| caption          = \n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| birth_name       = Emma Minnie \u00e0 Beckett\n| birth_date       = {{Birth date|df=yes|1858|11|23}}\n| birth_place      = [[Collingwood, Victoria]], Australia\n| death_date       = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1936|09|13|1858|11|23}}\n| death_place      = [[Sandringham, Victoria]], Australia\n| resting_place    = \n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline}} -->\n| nationality      = Australian\n| spouse           = [[Arthur Merric Boyd]]\n| father           = [[William Arthur \u00e0 Beckett]]\n| mother           = Emma \u00e0 Beckett ([[Given name#Name at birth|n\u00e9e]] Mills)\n| children         = {{unbulleted list|[[Penleigh Boyd]]|[[Merric Boyd]]|[[Martin Boyd]]|Helen Read}}\n| relatives        = [[Arthur Boyd]]; [[Guy Boyd (sculptor)|Guy Boyd]] (grandsons)\n| education        = \n| alma_mater       = \n| known_for        = [[Painting|Landscape painting]]\n| notable_works    = \n| style            = \n| movement         = \n| awards           = <!-- {{awd|award|year|title|role|name}} (optional) -->\n| website          = <!-- {{URL|Example.com}} -->\n| module           =\n| footnotes        =<ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |first=Marjorie J. |last=Tipping |authorlink= |year=1979 |id2=boyd-emma-minnie-5610 |title=Boyd, Emma Minnie (1858\u20131936) |accessdate=20 March 2014 |volume=Vol. 7 }}</ref>  \n}}\n'''Emma Minnie Boyd''' (23 November 1858\u201313 September 1936) nee \u00e0 Beckett, was an experienced and prolific Australian artist who exhibited publicly from 1874, as a gifted teenager, to 1932.

The \u00e0 Beckett's were able to give the young couple and their children the means to pursue careers in the arts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Naill |first1=Brenda |title=the Boyds: a family biography |date=2002 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |location=Melbourne}}</ref> \n\nTogether Arthur and Minnie had five children, Gilbert born 1886, who was tragically killed in a fall from a horse in 1896, [[Merric Boyd]] born 1888, [[Penleigh Boyd]] 1890, [[Martin Boyd]] in 1893, and her youngest and only daughter Helen 1903. All her children were involved in the arts, including Helen who became a painter. After her marriage Emma Minnie and Arthur Merric Boyd continued to receive support from her family. They moved into one of the family homes, The Grange, where they began raising their own family. As a woman who was well off, she had nannies to help her with the children and servants to help her with the house, duties expected of women in this time. This allowed her to continue to work even after starting a family.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Boyd-Lassie.jpg|thumb|200px|A Lassie Yet]]\nEmma Minnie Boyd was a prolific painter and exhibited her work frequently. She was one of the more versatile Australian artists and her work was varied. She was a contemporary of Artists like [[James Conder]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] and her work was exhibited alongside theirs. Both the Boyd\u2019s were acquainted with the artists who worked at the Heidelberg School but family and circumstance prevented them from also taking part. As a newly married couple they would be expected to set up house together and see about starting a family, it would not have been appropriate for them to be gallivanting across the countryside with a group of other painters. Because of this it is possible that both their careers could have suffered without the professional relationships and recognition the Heidelberg school achieved with the public.  \n\nEmma Minnie Boyd also worked with Louis Buvelot, with whom she shared a facility for landscape watercolour \u201cand a cautious tonal impressionism, with its persistent echoes of the Dutch school.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobrez |first1=Patricia |last2=Herbst |first2=Peter |title=The Art of the Boyds: Generations of Artistic Achievement |date=1990 |publisher=Bay Books |location=Sydney |page=30}}</ref>  In 1890 the Boyd\u2019s went to Europe to work, with their two young sons, where their work was shown at the Royal academy of the Arts, Boyd made several works during her time there. she was a religious woman and painted many of her social conscience works overseas. The loss of family investments in the crash of the Melbourne land boom brought Emma and her husband back to Melbourne, where she taught art students in her city studio.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first= Jane|title = Emma Minnie Boyd: 1858\u20131936 | year= 2004|publisher= Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery}}\n</ref>\n\nHer work ''Interior with figures, The Grange'' 1875 shows her talent for watercolour. Painted when she was just sixteen it is a snapshot of Australian life. The large bay window is shaded by galvanised iron typical of Australian homes of the period. The interior is relaxed, with the window opened.  A young Man sits on the window ledge not quite inside or outside the room, his companion, a young woman is seated inside, sewing. There is a relaxed atmosphere with the messy sewing box and two cats playing by a chair to the left of the painting. The spatial relationship of the kittens imitates that of the man and the woman. It comments on the relaxed atmosphere and social obligations that were a part of colonial society in Australia. Even during Victorian times social standards and decorum was not as strict as it was in Britain<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dobrez |first1=Patricia |last2=Herbst |first2=peter |title=The Art of the Boyds: Generations of Artistic achievement |date=1990 |publisher=bay Books |location=Sydney |pages=28}}</ref>.    \n\nShe painted many watercolour landscape paintings of the Australian Bush; these works were popular with the public because the Australian landscape is quite unique to Australia and it represented a sense of national pride leading up to federation in 1901.<ref>{{cite web |title=Australian Impressionism |url=https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/australianimpressionism/education/insights_national.html |website=National Gallery of Victoria |accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nShe died at Sandringham on 13 September 1936, survived by two of her sons and her daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\nFor many years she has been documented only as the mother of significant artists [[Penleigh Boyd]] and [[Merric Boyd]] and novelist [[Martin Boyd]] (her daughter Helen Read was also a prolific artist), and grandmother of [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Guy Boyd (sculptor)|Guy Boyd]] but she was one of the most prolific and consistent women artists of her generation in Melbourne, with a career that significantly outlasted that of [[Jane Sutherland]], for example. Emma Minnie Boyd's art was shown in its own right as works of historical and curatorial merit in the 1992\u20131993 touring exhibition ''Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg School'', at the [[Heide Museum of Modern Art]] and elsewhere, and in a retrospective in 2004 at the [[Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery]].\n\n==Selected paintings==\n<gallery mode=packed heights=175>\nFile:Boyd-Harkaway.jpg|[[Harkaway, Victoria|Harkaway]] Landscape\nFile:Boyd-Workhouse.jpg|To the Workhouse\nFile:Boyd-Load.jpg|The Last Load\nFile:Boyd-Martha.jpg|Near [[Mount Martha]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\nHammond, V & Peers, J 1992, ''Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg Era'', Artmores, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia.\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Emma Minnie Boyd}}\n*[http://www.artnet.com/artists/emma-minnie-abeckett-boyd/ More works by Boyd] @ ArtNet\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boyd, Emma Minnie}}\n[[Category:1858 births]]\n[[Category:1936 deaths]]\n[[Category:Australian women painters]]\n[[Category:Heidelberg School]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian artists]]\n[[Category:19th-century Australian women artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian women artists]]\n[[Category:Australian Impressionist painters]]\n[[Category:Boyd family|Emma Minnie]]\n", "name_user": "Chris.sherlock", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Minnie_Boyd"}

She requested to be awoken at 6:45{{nbsp}}am, and started the day with a long prayer at her window, thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands (\"a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands\"), then the legs. Nurses noted that she moved faster than other residents who were 30 years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and [[rusks]].\n\nShe washed herself unassisted with a [[flannel]] cloth rather than taking a shower, applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish.

The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract [[German measles]], [[chickenpox]], or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with [[digoxin]]. Later she suffered from [[arthropathy]] in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was {{cvt|150|cm|ftin}}, and her weight {{cvt|45|kg}}, showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.\n\nAnalysis of her blood samples were in [[Reference ranges for blood tests|normal ranges]] between ages 111\u2013114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the [[HLA system]] revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] hypertrophy with a mild left [[atrial]] dilatation and [[Premature heart beat|extrasystolic arrhythmia]]. Radiology revealed diffuse [[osteoporosis]], as well as incipient [[osteoarthritis]] in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} She fell in January 1990 (aged 114) and fractured her [[femur]], which required surgery.<ref name=validation /> Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair,<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}} and she abandoned her daily routine.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85\u201392}}\n\nAt the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Dr. Victor L\u00e8bre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\"), and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. During the last years, she was {{cvt|137|cm|ftin}} tall, and weighed {{cvt|40|kg}}; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years.

The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. [[Frontal lobe|Frontal brain lobe]] functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive [[neurological disease]], depressive symptoms or other functional illness.

She requested to be awoken at 6:45{{nbsp}}am, and started the day with a long prayer at her window, thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands (\"a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands\"), then the legs. Nurses noted that she moved faster than other residents who were 30 years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and [[rusks]].\n\nShe washed herself unassisted with a [[flannel]] cloth rather than taking a shower, applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish.

The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract [[German measles]], [[chickenpox]], or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with [[digoxin]]. Later she suffered from [[arthropathy]] in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was {{cvt|150|cm|ftin}}, and her weight {{cvt|45|kg}}, showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.\n\nAnalysis of her blood samples were in [[Reference ranges for blood tests|normal ranges]] between ages 111\u2013114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the [[HLA system]] revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] hypertrophy with a mild left [[atrial]] dilatation and [[Premature heart beat|extrasystolic arrhythmia]]. Radiology revealed diffuse [[osteoporosis]], as well as incipient [[osteoarthritis]] in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} She fell in January 1990 (aged 114) and fractured her [[femur]], which required surgery.<ref name=validation /> Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair,<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}} and she abandoned her daily routine.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85\u201392}}\n\nAt the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Dr. Victor L\u00e8bre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\"), and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. During the last years, she was {{cvt|137|cm|ftin}} tall, and weighed {{cvt|40|kg}}; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years.

The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. [[Frontal lobe|Frontal brain lobe]] functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive [[neurological disease]], depressive symptoms or other functional illness.
