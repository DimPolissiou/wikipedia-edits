The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].\n\nIt is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\". It is central to many systems of timekeeping, including the [[Gregorian calendar|Western calendar]] and [[time|units of time of day]], and frequently appears in the world\u2019s major religions.\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nTwelve is the largest number with a [[monosyllable|single-syllable]] name in [[English language|English]]. Early [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] numbers have been theorized to have been non-[[decimal]]: evidence includes the unusual phrasing of [[11 (number)|eleven]] and twelve, the [[long hundred|former use of \"hundred\"]] to refer to groups of [[120 (number)|120]], and the presence of glosses such as \"tentywise\" or \"ten-count\" in medieval texts showing that writers could not presume their readers would normally understand them that way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gordon |first = E.

Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>\nIn [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zw\u00f6lf'').

Twelve is also a [[highly composite number]], the next one being [[24 (number)|twenty-four]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002182|title=Sloane's A002182 : Highly composite numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nTwelve is the smallest [[abundant number]], since it is the smallest integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16) is greater than itself. Twelve is a [[sublime number]], a number that has a [[perfect number]] of divisors, and the sum of its divisors is also a perfect number.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A081357|title=Sloane's A081357 : Sublime numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation |access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref> Since there is a subset of 12's proper divisors that add up to 12 (all of them but with 4 excluded), 12 is a [[semiperfect number]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://oeis.org/A005835 |title=Sloane's A005835 : Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) numbers |website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences |publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIf an odd [[perfect number]] is of the form 12''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, it has at least twelve distinct prime factors.\n\nA twelve-sided [[polygon]] is a [[dodecagon]]. A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.\n\nTwelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists. This cusp form is the discriminant \u0394(''q'') whose Fourier coefficients are given by the [[Ramanujan]] {{mvar|&tau;}}-function and which is (up to a constant multiplier) the 24th power of the [[Dedekind eta function]]. This fact is related to a constellation of interesting appearances of the number twelve in mathematics ranging from the value of the [[Riemann zeta function]] at \u22121 i.e. \u03b6(\u22121)&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|12}}, the fact that the abelianization of [[SL(2,Z)]] has twelve elements, and even the properties of lattice polygons.\n\nThere are twelve [[Jacobian elliptic function]]s and twelve cubic [[distance-transitive graph]]s.\n\nThere are 12 [[Latin square]]s of size 3 \u00d7 3.\n\nThe [[duodecimal]] system (12<sub>10</sub> [twelve] =&nbsp;10<sub>12</sub>), which is the use of 12 as a division factor for many [[ancient weights and measures|ancient]] and [[medieval weights and measures]], including [[hour]]s, probably originates from [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn [[base thirteen]] and higher bases (such as [[hexadecimal]]), twelve is represented as C.

The [[superfactorial|product of the first 3 factorials]], twelve is a [[superior highly composite number]], divisible by [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]].\n\nIt is approximately the number of full [[new moon|lunations of the moon]] in a year, and the number of years for a [[Jupiter#Pre-telescopic_research|full cycle of Jupiter]], which was historically considered the brightest \"wandering star\".

Another system spells out all numbers written in one or two words (''sixteen'', ''twenty-seven'', ''fifteen thousand'', but ''372'' or ''15,001'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html|title=Numbers: Writing Numbers // Purdue Writing Lab|first=|date=|website=Purdue Writing Lab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref>\nIn [[German orthography]], there used to be the widely followed (but unofficial) rule of spelling out numbers up to twelve  (''zw\u00f6lf'').

A twelve-[[face (geometry)|faced]] [[polyhedron]] is a [[dodecahedron]]. Regular [[cube]]s and [[octahedron]]s both have 12 edges, while regular [[icosahedron]]s have 12 vertices. Twelve is a [[pentagonal number]]. The densest three-dimensional [[lattice (group)|lattice]] [[sphere packing]] has each sphere touching 12 others, and this is almost certainly true for ''any'' arrangement of spheres  (the [[Kepler conjecture]]). Twelve is also the [[kissing number]] in three dimensions.\n\nTwelve is the smallest weight for which a [[cusp form]] exists.

The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the Massanutten range, is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller highland valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain ridgeline in the southernmost end of the vallet and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==History==\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap on a rough road constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] would have made Washington's plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked an army road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed the easier entry along Passage Creek is unclear, leading to some belief the story is apocryphal. However the story is likely tied to the name given to Fort Valley.\n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping, unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The site can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Fort Valley\n| photo = Fort_Valley_air.jpg\n| photo_caption = Air photo of Fort Valley, facing south, with the North (right) and South (left) Forks of the [[Shenandoah River]] visible.

The fact that a Russian team [sic] has finally played a full-scale, if unofficial Test match against {{nrut|France}} speaks for itself.''\n\n:\"''Rugby tours between countries on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]] have generated considerable political interest among the governments concerned, and the results can be quite astonishing.

In such societies rugby, like many other sports before it, is becoming an expression of national achievement and therefore the subject of careful nurturing. Yet, is the risk of the double standard, so evident in the athletic arena, permeating the [[East Europeans]]' approach to rugby so great as to justify the exclusion of the Communist world indefinitely from regular rugby competition?''\"<ref name=Laidlaw/>\n\n:\"''Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins.

As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004.

The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.\n\nRomania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005.

Over the last 30 or 40 years it has spread through Eastern Europe, establishing itself strongly in Rumania and [[Rugby union in Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Rugby union in Hungary|Hungary]] and into the [[Rugby union in the Soviet Union|USSR]]. The fact that a Russian team [sic] has finally played a full-scale, if unofficial Test match against {{nrut|France}} speaks for itself.''\n\n:\"''Rugby tours between countries on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]] have generated considerable political interest among the governments concerned, and the results can be quite astonishing. The recent {{nrut|Rumania}}n tour of New Zealand, for instance, germinated other contacts between the two countries and was partly instrumental in the establishment of new trade agreements which otherwise might not have begun.''\"<ref name=Laidlaw>Laidlaw, p52</ref>\n\nChris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:\n:\"''So far as the East Europeans and the [[Rugby union in Russia|Russians]] are concerned, who knows where the incentives lie? In such societies rugby, like many other sports before it, is becoming an expression of national achievement and therefore the subject of careful nurturing. Yet, is the risk of the double standard, so evident in the athletic arena, permeating the East Europeans' approach to rugby so great as to justify the exclusion of the Communist world indefinitely from regular rugby competition?''\"<ref name=Laidlaw/>\n\n:\"''Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins. Russia emerged from behind the Iron Curtain and came under international scrutiny when they played France in Toulouse in November 1978. Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the [[FIRA \u2013 Association of European Rugby|Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur]], the governing body for those countries not in the [[International Rugby Board|IB]].''\"<ref>Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p8</ref>\n\n===Post-Communism===\nAfter the fall of Communism in 1989, Romanian rugby union suffered a dramatic financial shortfall.  In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constan\u0163a.\n\nRomania first got regular international competition when they joined the newly formed [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]] in 2000. As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].\n\n[[Bucure\u015fti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004.

Romania has won the competition on three occasions 2000, 2001\u20132002 and 2005-2006.\n\nThe [[Antim Cup]] is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.\n\nRomania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005.

He later entered federal politics and served as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[South Australia]] from 1901 to 1903. He was the first of four Australian politicians from the [[Downer family]] dynasty.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Adelaide]], John Downer (the son of [[Downer family|Henry Downer]] who came to [[South Australia]] in 1838 and his wife Jane, ''n\u00e9e'' Field) was educated on a scholarship at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]], where he was a brilliant student.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 35. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref> On 23 March 1867 he was admitted to the bar, and soon won a reputation as being among Adelaide's most talented and eloquent lawyers.\n\n==South Australian politician==\n[[File:John Downer (Australian politician).jpg|thumb|right|Downer in 1898]]\nDowner became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1878, the same year in which he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] for [[Barossa Valley|Barossa]]. He represented this constituency until 1901, leaving it only to enter federal politics.\n\nIn the House of Assembly he soon made his mark and became [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] in [[John Cox Bray]]'s cabinet on 24 June 1881. He endeavoured to bring in several law reforms, and though his married women's property bill was not passed, he succeeded in carrying bills allowing accused persons to give evidence on oath, and amending the insolvency and marriage acts. The government was defeated in June 1884, but a year later, on 16 June 1885, Downer himself became Premier for the first time, as well as being Attorney-General once again.\n\nWhile Premier, Downer oversaw the construction of the first train line from Adelaide to Melbourne. He also made significant contributions to establishing irrigation settlements along the Murray River. Although this ministry lasted two years and passed a fair amount of legislation, it was often in difficulties, and in June 1886 had to be reconstructed.\n\nAt the [[1887 Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference]] held in London during 1887, Downer represented South Australia, but during his return journey to Australia his government was defeated. This ministry was responsible for a tariff imposing increased protective duties. Downer was not in office again for several years, but in October 1892 again became Premier, taking also the portfolio of Chief Secretary. In May 1893 he exchanged this for the position of [[Treasurer of South Australia]], but was ousted at the [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] by liberal [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] with the support of the new [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] led by [[John McPherson (Australian politician)|John McPherson]]. Downer remarked of this party: 'They are very clever fellows. I have great respect for the way they use either side for their purposes with absolute impartiality'. For most of the period until 1899 Downer led the Opposition.\n\nDowner was a strong federalist and had represented South Australia at the 1883 and 1891 [[Federation of Australia|conventions]].

He later entered federal politics and served as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[South Australia]] from 1901 to 1903. He was the first of four Australian politicians from the [[Downer family]] dynasty.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Adelaide]], John Downer (the son of [[Downer family|Henry Downer]] who came to [[South Australia]] in 1838 and his wife Jane, ''n\u00e9e'' Field) was educated on a scholarship at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]], where he was a brilliant student.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 35. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref> On 23 March 1867 he was admitted to the bar, and soon won a reputation as being among Adelaide's most talented and eloquent lawyers.\n\n==South Australian politician==\n[[File:John Downer (Australian politician).jpg|thumb|right|Downer in 1898]]\nDowner became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1878, the same year in which he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] for [[Barossa Valley|Barossa]]. He represented this constituency until 1901, leaving it only to enter federal politics.\n\nIn the House of Assembly he soon made his mark and became [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] in [[John Cox Bray]]'s cabinet on 24 June 1881. He endeavoured to bring in several law reforms, and though his married women's property bill was not passed, he succeeded in carrying bills allowing accused persons to give evidence on oath, and amending the insolvency and marriage acts. The government was defeated in June 1884, but a year later, on 16 June 1885, Downer himself became Premier for the first time, as well as being Attorney-General once again.\n\nWhile Premier, Downer oversaw the construction of the first train line from Adelaide to Melbourne. He also made significant contributions to establishing irrigation settlements along the Murray River. Although this ministry lasted two years and passed a fair amount of legislation, it was often in difficulties, and in June 1886 had to be reconstructed.\n\nAt the [[1887 Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference]] held in London during 1887, Downer represented South Australia, but during his return journey to Australia his government was defeated. This ministry was responsible for a tariff imposing increased protective duties. Downer was not in office again for several years, but in October 1892 again became Premier, taking also the portfolio of Chief Secretary. In May 1893 he exchanged this for the position of [[Treasurer of South Australia]], but was ousted at the [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] by liberal [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] with the support of the new [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] led by [[John McPherson (Australian politician)|John McPherson]]. Downer remarked of this party: 'They are very clever fellows. I have great respect for the way they use either side for their purposes with absolute impartiality'. For most of the period until 1899 Downer led the Opposition.\n\nDowner was a strong federalist and had represented South Australia at the 1883 and 1891 [[Federation of Australia|conventions]]. At the latter meeting, he took an important part in protecting the interests of the smaller states, and was a member of the constitutional committee. He was elected one of the 10 representatives of South Australia at the 1897 convention, and was again on the constitutional committee.\n\n==Federal politician and return to state politics==\nAt the time of Federation in 1901, Downer was elected as one of the inaugural [[Senate of Australia|senators]] for the [[Protectionist Party]] in [[South Australia]] at the first [[Parliament of Australia]], but he did not seek re-election in 1903.
