Clinical research may also be conducted to learn other things about medical treatments or procedures, such as how to make an earlier diagnosis or how the treatment interacts with other drugs.\n\nThough there are many types of clinical research, the two most common are interventional and observational. For example, researchers trying to identify causes of PD may conduct an observational study to examine genetic or environmental factors that may have triggered the disease in an individual. Natural history studies that evaluate how Parkinson's affects different people and how it changes over time are another example of observational research. [[Diagnostic test|Diagnostic accuracy]] studies are used to investigate how well a test, or a series of tests, are able to correctly identify diseased patients.\n\nResearchers conducting [[clinical trial]]s test the impact of treatments. These can include changing behavior, taking medications, or performing surgery. Interventional and observational research are equally important in helping to answer questions, develop new treatments, and ultimately find a cure for Parkinson's. Clinical trials are conducted in a series of phases.\n\nAmong the interventional and observational studies for Parkinson's disease, research is ongoing in a number of specific areas.\n\n=== Quality of life ===\n\n[[Quality of life]] research investigates the function that physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise or other interventions may play in the quality of life of persons with Parkinson's disease.

The researchers implanted cells only in rats with disease signs. The astrocytes used in the study differ from other types of astrocytes present in the mature brain. When implanted into the brains of rats with the disease, the new cells acted similar to astrocytes in the developing brain, which are more effective at building connections between nerves. The implanted astrocytes restored health and stability and allowed the nerve cells to resume normal activity.<ref name=m1401>{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-01-parkinson-therapy.html |title=Finding points to possible new Parkinson's therapy |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref>\n\nSuccessful long-term therapy must both protect the areas of the brain under attack and foster the repair of dopaminergic neurons damage to other brain cell populations.

In addition to furthering the scientific community\u2019s knowledge of Parkinson\u2019s, clinical trial participation may offer access to leading healthcare professionals and potentially useful new drugs and therapies.  This care is often provided free of charge in exchange for participation in the study.

Clinical research may also be conducted to learn other things about medical treatments or procedures, such as how to make an earlier diagnosis or how the treatment interacts with other drugs.\n\nThough there are many types of clinical research, the two most common are interventional and observational. For example, researchers trying to identify causes of PD may conduct an observational study to examine genetic or environmental factors that may have triggered the disease in an individual. Natural history studies that evaluate how Parkinson's affects different people and how it changes over time are another example of observational research. [[Diagnostic test|Diagnostic accuracy]] studies are used to investigate how well a test, or a series of tests, are able to correctly identify diseased patients.\n\nResearchers conducting [[clinical trial]]s test the impact of treatments. These can include changing behavior, taking medications, or performing surgery. Interventional and observational research are equally important in helping to answer questions, develop new treatments, and ultimately find a cure for Parkinson's. Clinical trials are conducted in a series of phases.\n\nAmong the interventional and observational studies for Parkinson's disease, research is ongoing in a number of specific areas.\n\n=== Quality of life ===\n\n[[Quality of life]] research investigates the function that physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise or other interventions may play in the quality of life of persons with Parkinson's disease.

The researchers implanted cells only in rats with disease signs. The astrocytes used in the study differ from other types of astrocytes present in the mature brain. When implanted into the brains of rats with the disease, the new cells acted similar to astrocytes in the developing brain, which are more effective at building connections between nerves. The implanted astrocytes restored health and stability and allowed the nerve cells to resume normal activity.<ref name=m1401>{{cite web|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-01-parkinson-therapy.html |title=Finding points to possible new Parkinson's therapy |publisher=Medicalxpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref>\n\nSuccessful long-term therapy must both protect the areas of the brain under attack and foster the repair of dopaminergic neurons damage to other brain cell populations. Astrocyte dysfunction can contribute to multiple neurological disorders.<ref name=m1401/>\n\nAfter transplantation, dopaminergic, [[interneuron]]s and [[synaptophysin]] were all rescued. Interneurons play an important role in information processing and movement control and are lost in Parkinson's. Synaptophysin is a protein that is essential for communication between nerve cells. The transplanted rats recovered motor skills to normal levels, essentially reversing all symptoms. No previous therapies rescued these cells.<ref name=m1401/>\n\n==Participant groups==\nParkinson\u2019s clinical research studies need volunteers at all stages of the disease to help solve the unanswered questions about Parkinson\u2019s and to develop new treatments.

Without clinical research participants, many of the advances in treating PD would not have happened.  In addition to furthering the scientific community\u2019s knowledge of Parkinson\u2019s, clinical trial participation may offer access to leading healthcare professionals and potentially useful new drugs and therapies.  This care is often provided free of charge in exchange for participation in the study.

Williams was known as \"Dr. Death\", a nickname he acquired in junior high school.\n\nWilliams was a three-time [[professional wrestling]] world heavyweight champion, having won the UWF World Heavyweight Championship twice and the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] once. In addition to his singles success, Williams achieved notoriety in Japan in tag team competition, winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]] eight times with notable tag team partners [[Terry Gordy]], and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]]. He also achieved great tag team success in North America, winning tag team titles in the Mid-South(UWF), World Championship Wrestling, and NWA United States Tag Team Championship as well as winning the [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] twice with Gordy and [[Mike Rotunda]].<ref name=\"wwebio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/dr-death-steve-williams|title=\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|accessdate=March 6, 2015|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/11793/124/|title=Wrestling legend Steve Williams passes away.|accessdate=December 30, 2009|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliams attended Lakewood High School in Colorado, graduating in 1978. He was the youngest of four children born to Gerald (died 1985) and Dottie Williams (died 2016). He grew up at 1360 Holland st, in Lakewood where he also was living at time of his death with his mother. He was on the track & field team, played football, and wrestled all four years. Williams graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1981 after a [[Oklahoma Sooners football|football]] career that saw him named an [[All-America]]n. He also competed as an [[Collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]], where he was a four time All American, finishing 6th as a freshman, 5th as a sophomore, 3rd as a junior and 2nd as a senior.  His senior year, he lost in the finals of an [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship|NCAA tournament]] to future Olympic medalist [[Bruce Baumgartner]]. Already interested in professional wrestling, Williams had a ready-made nickname that dated back to an incident in [[junior high]] wherein he had to wrestle in a [[ice hockey|hockey]] [[goaltender|goalie]]'s mask due to shattering his nose and was jokingly labeled \"Dr. Death\" by one of his school's coaches and his sister.\n\n==Football career==\n\n=== College ===\nWilliams started every game in 1982 for the Oklahoma Sooners at right guard. He was named to the UPI All-Big Eight first team and played in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl. He was also a member of the Sooners 1980 Orange Bowl and 1981 Sun Bowl squads. Williams played both guard positions while at OU.\n\n=== Professional ===\nWilliams was selected by the [[New Jersey Generals]] in the 1983 [[USFL]] Territorial Draft on January 3, 1983. He signed with the Generals on January 31, just prior to the opening of training camp. Williams was converted to a defensive tackle in training camp and was a teammate of RB [[Herschel Walker]]. During camp, Williams suffered a bruised knee and was placed on injured reserve for the first six games of the Generals 1983 season.\n\nAfter being activated for week #10 vs. the [[Birmingham Stallions]] on May 9, Williams was the starting nose tackle for the Generals in a 22\u20137 loss at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. The game was telecast live on ESPN. Williams started at nose tackle the following week on May 16, in a 31\u201324 loss to the [[Michigan Panthers]] at the Silverdome in Pontiac, MI \u2013 a game also shown on ESPN.\n\n== Professional wrestling career (1982\u20132009) ==\n\n=== Early years (1982\u20131987) ===\nWilliams, trained for professional wrestling by [[Bill Watts]] and [[Buddy Landel]], started wrestling in 1982 in Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. In 1985, he formed a team with [[Ted DiBiase]] and feuded with [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] and The Nightmare. In 1986, Mid-South was renamed the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (United States)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] and Williams went on to win the [[UWF Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Ray Traylor|Big Bubba Rogers]]. When [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] bought the UWF in late 1987, he was one of the few UWF wrestlers to receive an initial push in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). During this time he also worked for [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\n=== Unpinned in North America for a decade (1987\u20131997) ===\nWilliams became involved with [[Jimmy Garvin]]'s war with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]'s [[The Varsity Club|Varsity Club]] in 1988, often teaming with Jimmy and [[Ron Garvin]] or [[Ron Simmons]] in various matches, including a Triple Cage \"Tower of Doom\" match at [[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]] in 1988. Williams, however, turned [[List of professional wrestling terms#H|heel]] and joined the Varsity Club in late 1988. He and Sullivan won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship]] at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]]. They feuded with [[The Road Warriors]] and he and [[Mike Rotunda]] won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] in the process.\n\nIn May 1989, Williams and Rotunda were stripped of the title, and the Varsity Club disbanded.  Not long after, Williams turned face again and had a short feud with Rotunda over who was responsible for the Varsity Club's breakup, before entering a feud with [[Lex Luger]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Championship]].  Williams was scheduled to face Luger for the title at [[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar '90]] on February 25, 1990.  When Sting, who was scheduled to face [[Ric Flair]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], suffered a legitimate knee injury, Luger turned face and was moved from the US title match to the World Title match in Sting's place.  Williams went to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] where he formed a tag team with [[Terry Gordy]] called [[The Miracle Violence Connection]]. They went on to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Steiner Brothers]]. One week after winning the WCW World Tag Team Title, Williams and Gordy won the vacant NWA World Tag Team Title, defeating [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Barry Windham]] in the tournament final. Their NWA title win, however, went unrecognized by the NWA. They held onto both titles until September 1992, when they lost them to Rhodes and Windham. At [[Starrcade (1992)|Starrcade]], Williams substituted for the injured [[Rick Rude]] to challenge Ron Simmons for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]], but lost by disqualification. He left WCW shortly thereafter.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Williams continued to work for All Japan Pro Wrestling and became a [[main event]]er for the company, making him one of the most successful foreign athletes in Japanese wrestling history. On July 28, 1994, he defeated Mitsuharu Misawa for the AJPW Triple Crown Championship, holding it for three months before dropping it to Toshiaki Kawada. He also sporadically wrestled in the U.S. on the [[independent circuit]]. That run was brought to an end during one of his appearances in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). After defeating [[Axl Rotten]] in approximately 2 minutes, Williams had an impromptu [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] match, but lost after being pinned by then-champion [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. The loss happened in February 1997 at ''[[Crossing the Line Again]]'', thus ending his unpinned streak in North America, which lasted since March 26, 1987.\n\n=== WWF and later years (1998\u20132004) ===\nIn May 1998, Williams was signed by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) prior to the \"[[Brawl for All]]\" competition, which was set up in [[List of professional wrestling terms#L|legitimate]] fights. WWF management took interest in signing him due to his success in All-Japan. Before entering the Brawl for All and signing a contract, he had only one in-ring match with the WWF, which was against [[2 Cold Scorpio]] on a [[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|WWF Shotgun]] taping [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|dark match]] (April 28, 1998). In his autobiography, \"How Dr. Death Became Dr. Life\", Williams stated that this was his tryout. Photos of this match were used on WWF trading cards and on the WWF's website. According to house show cards and recaps, [[Vince McMahon]] introduced him to the ring for this dark match (http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/98.htm).\n\nOn the July 20, 1998 edition of [[WWE Raw|Raw is War]], Williams entered the Brawl for All tournament, making his first WWF television appearance. He was expected to win it due to his reputation as one of the toughest men in the wrestling business. Williams was the contestant that the WWF management wanted to win, as he was being groomed by Vince McMahon as a possible contender for the WWF Championship that was in the possession of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]] during the Brawl for All tournament. However, after beating [[Carl Ouellet|Pierre Carl Ouellet]] in the first round, he faced [[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]] in the semifinals and suffered a torn hamstring. Gunn then knocked out Williams, who missed several months following the injury. Upon healing in January 1999, Williams would work dark matches on [[WWE Heat|Heat]]/Shotgun/Raw is War tapings, mainly against Bob Holly to open-up the tapings.\n\nWilliams was involved in a brief [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] where he was managed by [[Jim Ross]] in early 1999 before Williams was released. During his time with Ross, he would attack people with [[suplex]]es, debuting on the February 22, 1999 edition of Raw is War as the masked man who threw Bart Gunn off a stage during a match of his. This story was played-off on WWF television as Williams getting revenge against Gunn for his Brawl for All loss. After, Williams was involved in two midcard storylines, one where he was pursuing the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] from [[Hardcore Holly]], and another where he sought revenge on [[Tiger Ali Singh]] for making fun of Ross on live television. According to Williams' autobiography, as well as in his [[Ring of Honor#Formation (2001 - 2003)|RF Video]] shoot interview in 2001, these midcard storylines were meant as a way to build his character up on television before entering a main-event feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]]. Williams was released in mid-April for needing further time to rehab his injury and for refusing to work for [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW]], a Japanese promotion that the WWF had talent exchanges with. He was scheduled to compete against Snow and Holly at [[Backlash: In Your House]] for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]], but he did not appear due to his release.\n\nAccording to an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bA3qxaU64c&t=4290s|radio interview from November 1999] (timestamp 1:11:30), Williams was originally planned to be in [[Triple H|Triple H's]] spot before his release, as much of what was previously booked for Williams was eventually given to Triple H. Most notably, the segment on the October 4, 1999 episode of Raw is War when Triple H attacked Jim Ross was the moment when Williams was going to start his feud with Austin. Because this segment was planned for Williams, this was supposed to be the moment he would become a heel, as Ross was going to manage him as a face until that point. It is unknown which month in 1999 that Williams was going to have this angle, but Williams stated in his book that his main-event push was going to start after the debut of [[WWE Smackdown|WWF Smackdown!]] on [[UPN]]. Considering that Williams was released in April (also the same time Triple H began being booked as an upper mid-carder), this occurrence of events could be a possible reason as to why [[D-Generation X]] abruptly ended that month, as the WWF needed to build-up another main-eventer to feud with the likes of Austin and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].\n\nIn November 1999, Williams appeared briefly in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) again, with [[Ed Ferrara|Oklahoma]] as his manager in a feud with [[Vampiro]], as a result of this feud, he wrestled against [[Jerry Only]] from the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] on the November 29, 1999, edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]]. He went back to All Japan Pro Wrestling and had a second stint from 2000 to 2003 and wrestled a couple of matches for WWE in 2003 against [[Lance Storm]]. In late 2003, he was involved with the independent promotion [[Major League Wrestling]] (MLW) and also wrestled for the new NWA Mid-Atlantic, where he won their title in one of the first professional wrestling events in China.\n\nOn March 14, 2004, Williams faced [[Belarus]]ian [[kickboxer]] [[Alexey Ignashov]] in a [[mixed martial arts]] bout in the [[K-1]] promotion and was [[knock out|knocked out]] 22 seconds into the fight. This was his first and only professional fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Steve-Williams-9942|title=Steve|first=|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancer, return to wrestling, and retirement (2004\u20132009) ===\nIn 2004, Williams underwent surgery for [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] and was declared cancer-free the next year.  His return match was against [[King Kaluha]], who he defeated on August 27, 2005 at [[WrestleReunion 2]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gerweck.net/2009/12/19/steve-williams/ |title=Steve Williams |author=Gerweck, Steve |date=December 19, 2009 |website=Gerweck.net |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>  According to promoter Sal Corrente, Williams was initially hesitant to work with King Kaluha but was ultimately appreciative about the choice of opponent.<ref name=\"RRN\">{{cite web |url=http://rasslinriotnews.blogspot.com/2010/01/piece-of-my-mind-jan-1st-2010-by-big.html |title=A Piece of my Mind |author=Corrente, Sal |date=January 1, 2010 |website=RasslinRiotNews.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nWilliams made an appearance at a [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] brand [[house show]] on March 11, 2006, in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], after which he was signed to help train up-and-coming WWE wrestlers in its [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) [[farm team|developmental territory]]. While acting in that capacity, he made a few appearances on OVW television, where he helped fellow Oklahoma wrestler [[Jack Swagger|Jake Hager]] and briefly working as his tag team partner. He also made an appearance at an August&nbsp;30 [[WWE Raw|Raw]] house show, during which he addressed the crowd and announced how happy he was to be cancer free for four years.\n\nLater, he made appearances for Oklahoma-based [[Independent circuit|independent federation]] Sooner World Class Wrestling (SWCW).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/newswire/719-oklahoma-wrestling-news-and-results-featuring-steve-williams-vs-butch-reed.html |title=Oklahoma Wrestling News and Results featuring Steve Williams vs. Butch Reed |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |publisher=Indy Wrestling News |work=Newswire |author=Adam Lash <!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR --> |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uJF52R57?url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/12/30/12307631.html |archivedate=November 17, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He also worked for [[Southwest Airlines]] in Colorado.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/blog/check-out-updated-qasrandom-thoughtslooks-whos-coming-jrs-bbq |title=Check out Updated Q&A's.....Random Thoughts....Looks who's coming to JR's BBQ. |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |publisher=JRs Bar B Q |work=JR's Blog}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of longtime rival and friend [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] in June 2009, Williams made the decision to retire from wrestling after 27 years. Williams's final match took place August 15 in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], for Asylum Championship Wrestling. He defeated Franco D'Angelo for the ACW Heavyweight Championship, which he vacated after the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2009/12/30/12307631.html |title=\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams dead at 49 |accessdate=2010-11-17 |publisher=Slam!

Williams was known as \"Dr. Death\", a nickname he acquired in junior high school.\n\nWilliams was a three-time [[professional wrestling]] world heavyweight champion, having won the UWF World Heavyweight Championship twice and the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] once. In addition to his singles success, Williams achieved notoriety in Japan in tag team competition, winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]] eight times with notable tag team partners [[Terry Gordy]], and [[Big Van Vader|Vader]]. He also achieved great tag team success in North America, winning tag team titles in the Mid-South(UWF), World Championship Wrestling, and NWA United States Tag Team Championship as well as winning the [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] twice with Gordy and [[Mike Rotunda]].<ref name=\"wwebio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/dr-death-steve-williams|title=\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|accessdate=March 6, 2015|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/11793/124/|title=Wrestling legend Steve Williams passes away.|accessdate=December 30, 2009|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nWilliams attended Lakewood High School in Colorado, graduating in 1978. He was the youngest of four children born to Gerald (died 1985) and Dottie Williams (died 2016). He grew up at 1360 Holland st, in Lakewood where he also was living at time of his death with his mother. He was on the track & field team, played football, and wrestled all four years. Williams graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1981 after a [[Oklahoma Sooners football|football]] career that saw him named an [[All-America]]n. He also competed as an [[Collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestler]], where he was a four time All American, finishing 6th as a freshman, 5th as a sophomore, 3rd as a junior and 2nd as a senior.  His senior year, he lost in the finals of an [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship|NCAA tournament]] to future Olympic medalist [[Bruce Baumgartner]]. Already interested in professional wrestling, Williams had a ready-made nickname that dated back to an incident in [[junior high]] wherein he had to wrestle in a [[ice hockey|hockey]] [[goaltender|goalie]]'s mask due to shattering his nose and was jokingly labeled \"Dr. Death\" by one of his school's coaches and his sister.\n\n==Football career==\n\n=== College ===\nWilliams started every game in 1982 for the Oklahoma Sooners at right guard. He was named to the UPI All-Big Eight first team and played in the 1983 Fiesta Bowl. He was also a member of the Sooners 1980 Orange Bowl and 1981 Sun Bowl squads. Williams played both guard positions while at OU.\n\n=== Professional ===\nWilliams was selected by the [[New Jersey Generals]] in the 1983 [[USFL]] Territorial Draft on January 3, 1983. He signed with the Generals on January 31, just prior to the opening of training camp. Williams was converted to a defensive tackle in training camp and was a teammate of RB [[Herschel Walker]]. During camp, Williams suffered a bruised knee and was placed on injured reserve for the first six games of the Generals 1983 season.\n\nAfter being activated for week #10 vs. the [[Birmingham Stallions]] on May 9, Williams was the starting nose tackle for the Generals in a 22\u20137 loss at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands. The game was telecast live on ESPN. Williams started at nose tackle the following week on May 16, in a 31\u201324 loss to the [[Michigan Panthers]] at the Silverdome in Pontiac, MI \u2013 a game also shown on ESPN.\n\n== Professional wrestling career (1982\u20132009) ==\n\n=== Early years (1982\u20131987) ===\nWilliams, trained for professional wrestling by [[Bill Watts]] and [[Buddy Landel]], started wrestling in 1982 in Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. In 1985, he formed a team with [[Ted DiBiase]] and feuded with [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] and The Nightmare. In 1986, Mid-South was renamed the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (United States)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] and Williams went on to win the [[UWF Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Ray Traylor|Big Bubba Rogers]]. When [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] bought the UWF in late 1987, he was one of the few UWF wrestlers to receive an initial push in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). During this time he also worked for [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].\n\n=== Unpinned in North America for a decade (1987\u20131997) ===\nWilliams became involved with [[Jimmy Garvin]]'s war with [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]'s [[The Varsity Club|Varsity Club]] in 1988, often teaming with Jimmy and [[Ron Garvin]] or [[Ron Simmons]] in various matches, including a Triple Cage \"Tower of Doom\" match at [[The Great American Bash (1988)|The Great American Bash]] in 1988. Williams, however, turned [[List of professional wrestling terms#H|heel]] and joined the Varsity Club in late 1988. He and Sullivan won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship]] at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]]. They feuded with [[The Road Warriors]] and he and [[Mike Rotunda]] won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] in the process.\n\nIn May 1989, Williams and Rotunda were stripped of the title, and the Varsity Club disbanded.  Not long after, Williams turned face again and had a short feud with Rotunda over who was responsible for the Varsity Club's breakup, before entering a feud with [[Lex Luger]] for the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Championship]].  Williams was scheduled to face Luger for the title at [[WrestleWar (1990)|WrestleWar '90]] on February 25, 1990.  When Sting, who was scheduled to face [[Ric Flair]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]], suffered a legitimate knee injury, Luger turned face and was moved from the US title match to the World Title match in Sting's place.  Williams went to [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] where he formed a tag team with [[Terry Gordy]] called [[The Miracle Violence Connection]]. They went on to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Steiner Brothers]]. One week after winning the WCW World Tag Team Title, Williams and Gordy won the vacant NWA World Tag Team Title, defeating [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Barry Windham]] in the tournament final. Their NWA title win, however, went unrecognized by the NWA. They held onto both titles until September 1992, when they lost them to Rhodes and Windham. At [[Starrcade (1992)|Starrcade]], Williams substituted for the injured [[Rick Rude]] to challenge Ron Simmons for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]], but lost by disqualification. He left WCW shortly thereafter.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Williams continued to work for All Japan Pro Wrestling and became a [[main event]]er for the company, making him one of the most successful foreign athletes in Japanese wrestling history. On July 28, 1994, he defeated Mitsuharu Misawa for the AJPW Triple Crown Championship, holding it for three months before dropping it to Toshiaki Kawada. He also sporadically wrestled in the U.S. on the [[independent circuit]]. That run was brought to an end during one of his appearances in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). After defeating [[Axl Rotten]] in approximately 2 minutes, Williams had an impromptu [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] match, but lost after being pinned by then-champion [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. The loss happened in February 1997 at ''[[Crossing the Line Again]]'', thus ending his unpinned streak in North America, which lasted since March 26, 1987.\n\n=== WWF and later years (1998\u20132004) ===\nIn May 1998, Williams was signed by the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) prior to the \"[[Brawl for All]]\" competition, which was set up in [[List of professional wrestling terms#L|legitimate]] fights. WWF management took interest in signing him due to his success in All-Japan. Before entering the Brawl for All and signing a contract, he had only one in-ring match with the WWF, which was against [[2 Cold Scorpio]] on a [[WWF Shotgun Saturday Night|WWF Shotgun]] taping [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|dark match]] (April 28, 1998). In his autobiography, \"How Dr. Death Became Dr. Life\", Williams stated that this was his tryout. Photos of this match were used on WWF trading cards and on the WWF's website. According to house show cards and recaps, [[Vince McMahon]] introduced him to the ring for this dark match (http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/98.htm).\n\nOn the July 20, 1998 edition of [[WWE Raw|Raw is War]], Williams entered the Brawl for All tournament, making his first WWF television appearance. He was expected to win it due to his reputation as one of the toughest men in the wrestling business. Williams was the contestant that the WWF management wanted to win, as he was being groomed by Vince McMahon as a possible contender for the WWF Championship that was in the possession of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]] during the Brawl for All tournament. However, after beating [[Carl Ouellet|Pierre Carl Ouellet]] in the first round, he faced [[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]] in the semifinals and suffered a torn hamstring. Gunn then knocked out Williams, who missed several months following the injury. Upon healing in January 1999, Williams would work dark matches on [[WWE Heat|Heat]]/Shotgun/Raw is War tapings, mainly against Bob Holly to open-up the tapings.\n\nWilliams was involved in a brief [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] where he was managed by [[Jim Ross]] in early 1999 before Williams was released. During his time with Ross, he would attack people with [[suplex]]es, debuting on the February 22, 1999 edition of Raw is War as the masked man who threw Bart Gunn off a stage during a match of his. This story was played-off on WWF television as Williams getting revenge against Gunn for his Brawl for All loss. After, Williams was involved in two midcard storylines, one where he was pursuing the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]] from [[Hardcore Holly]], and another where he sought revenge on [[Tiger Ali Singh]] for making fun of Ross on live television. According to Williams' autobiography, as well as in his [[Ring of Honor#Formation (2001 - 2003)|RF Video]] shoot interview in 2001, these midcard storylines were meant as a way to build his character up on television before entering a main-event feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]]. Williams was released in mid-April for needing further time to rehab his injury and for refusing to work for [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling|FMW]], a Japanese promotion that the WWF had talent exchanges with. He was scheduled to compete against Snow and Holly at [[Backlash: In Your House]] for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]], but he did not appear due to his release.\n\nAccording to an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bA3qxaU64c&t=4290s|radio interview from November 1999] (timestamp 1:11:30), Williams was originally planned to be in [[Triple H|Triple H's]] spot before his release, as much of what was previously booked for Williams was eventually given to Triple H. Most notably, the segment on the October 4, 1999 episode of Raw is War when Triple H attacked Jim Ross was the moment when Williams was going to start his feud with Austin. Because this segment was planned for Williams, this was supposed to be the moment he would become a heel, as Ross was going to manage him as a face until that point. It is unknown which month in 1999 that Williams was going to have this angle, but Williams stated in his book that his main-event push was going to start after the debut of [[WWE Smackdown|WWF Smackdown!]] on [[UPN]]. Considering that Williams was released in April (also the same time Triple H began being booked as an upper mid-carder), this occurrence of events could be a possible reason as to why [[D-Generation X]] abruptly ended that month, as the WWF needed to build-up another main-eventer to feud with the likes of Austin and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].\n\nIn November 1999, Williams appeared briefly in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) again, with [[Ed Ferrara|Oklahoma]] as his manager in a feud with [[Vampiro]], as a result of this feud, he wrestled against [[Jerry Only]] from the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] on the November 29, 1999, edition of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]]. He went back to All Japan Pro Wrestling and had a second stint from 2000 to 2003 and wrestled a couple of matches for WWE in 2003 against [[Lance Storm]]. In late 2003, he was involved with the independent promotion [[Major League Wrestling]] (MLW) and also wrestled for the new NWA Mid-Atlantic, where he won their title in one of the first professional wrestling events in China.\n\nOn March 14, 2004, Williams faced [[Belarus]]ian [[kickboxer]] [[Alexey Ignashov]] in a [[mixed martial arts]] bout in the [[K-1]] promotion and was [[knock out|knocked out]] 22 seconds into the fight. This was his first and only professional fight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Steve-Williams-9942|title=Steve|first=|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancer, return to wrestling, and retirement (2004\u20132009) ===\nIn 2004, Williams underwent surgery for [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]] and was declared cancer-free the next year.

Estimates of the age at death depend on whether the maturity stage of the teeth or skeleton is used, and whether that maturity is compared to that of [[Homo sapiens|modern humans]] or to [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]].
