Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). Included on the ''I Am...'' disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00e9's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. [[Columbia Records]] released the song, the album's fourth single, to [[mainstream radio]] in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by [[Ray LaMontagne]]'s 2004 song \"Shelter,\" \"Halo\" was written and composed by [[Ryan Tedder]], [[E. Kidd Bogart|Evan Bogart]], Eric Nealante Phillips. It was conceived by Tedder and Nealante specifically for Beyonc\u00e9, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for [[Leona Lewis]].\n\n\"Halo\" is a [[Pop music|pop]] [[power ballad]], the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features [[drum]], [[piano]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[String instrument|string]], [[synthesizer]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instrumentation. The song faced a controversy when [[Kelly Clarkson]] claimed that Tedder had reused the musical arrangement in her own 2009 song \"[[Already Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Already Gone]].\" \"Halo\" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis's 2007 song \"[[Bleeding Love]].\" Its production and Beyonc\u00e9's emotional vocals also received critical praise. \"Halo\" was nominated for [[Record of the Year]] and won [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. It won [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song|Best Song]] at the [[2009 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. \"Halo\" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway, and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. It has received over ten certifications including a seven-times platinum certification from Australia and a double-platinum from Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n[[Philip Andelman]] directed the ballad's accompanying [[music video]], which features American actor [[Michael Ealy]]. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyonc\u00e9's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyonc\u00e9's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to \"Halo\" were changed for three of Beyonc\u00e9's special live performances: in a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]] following his death, a tribute to the victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and [[Kobe Bryant|Kobe]] and [[Gianna Bryant's]] memorial in 2020. The song has been [[Cover version|covered]] by many artists, including [[Florence and the Machine]], [[Harper Blynn]], and [[Westlife]]. It was performed on the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]],'' and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian [[soap opera]] ''[[Caminho das \u00cdndias]].''\n\n==Writing and production==\n[[File:Ryan Tedder OneRepublic Austria 3.jpg|Beyonc\u00e9, Bogart, and Tedder ''(pictured)'' composed \"Halo\" in Tedder's music studio in California.|thumb|alt=The portrait of a blonde man. He wears a gray coat and a hat.|upright]]\n\"Halo\" was composed by [[Ryan Tedder]], lead vocalist of [[OneRepublic]], together with [[Evan \"Kidd\" Bogart]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]].<ref name=\"booklet1\"/> In an interview for [[HitQuarters]], Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his [[Achilles tendon]] and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer [[Ray LaMontagne]] was the primary inspiration for \"Halo\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \"[[Trouble (Ray LaMontagne album)|Shelter]]\" for Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband [[Jay-Z]], and proposed the title \"Halo\" after hearing Tedder play \"angelic\" [[chord (music)|chords]]. They wrote the song in three hours.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |title=Interview With Evan 'Kidd' Bogart |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=February 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |first=Kimbel |last=Bouwman |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624wuY74C?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"bill10053\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/467645/beyonces-30-biggest-billboard-hits|title=Beyonc\u00e9's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits|page=2|first1=Erika|last1=Ramirez|first2=Jason|last2=Lipshutz|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Simon Cowell]], owner of the music production company [[Syco Entertainment]], Bogart and Tedder intended \"Halo\" for his client, singer [[Leona Lewis]], who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> Cowell was upset that Beyonc\u00e9 chose to record the song.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> David Balls, editor of the British media website [[Digital Spy]], asked Tedder during an interview whether \"Halo\" had initially been written for Lewis.<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\"/> Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyonc\u00e9 waited a long time before recording it.<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a189416/tedder-halo-wasnt-written-for-leona.html |title=Music \u2013 News \u2013 Tedder: 'Halo wasn't written for Leona' |publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

I thought this would be a brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have&nbsp;...

Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). Included on the ''I Am...'' disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyonc\u00e9's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. [[Columbia Records]] released the song, the album's fourth single, to [[mainstream radio]] in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by [[Ray LaMontagne]]'s 2004 song \"Shelter,\" \"Halo\" was written and composed by [[Ryan Tedder]], [[E. Kidd Bogart|Evan Bogart]], Eric Nealante Phillips. It was conceived by Tedder and Nealante specifically for Beyonc\u00e9, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for [[Leona Lewis]].\n\n\"Halo\" is a [[Pop music|pop]] [[power ballad]], the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features [[drum]], [[piano]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[String instrument|string]], [[synthesizer]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instrumentation. The song faced a controversy when [[Kelly Clarkson]] claimed that Tedder had reused the musical arrangement in her own 2009 song \"[[Already Gone (Kelly Clarkson song)|Already Gone]].\" \"Halo\" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis's 2007 song \"[[Bleeding Love]].\" Its production and Beyonc\u00e9's emotional vocals also received critical praise. \"Halo\" was nominated for [[Record of the Year]] and won [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. It won [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song|Best Song]] at the [[2009 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. \"Halo\" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway, and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. It has received over ten certifications including a seven-times platinum certification from Australia and a double-platinum from Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n[[Philip Andelman]] directed the ballad's accompanying [[music video]], which features American actor [[Michael Ealy]]. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyonc\u00e9's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyonc\u00e9's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to \"Halo\" were changed for two of Beyonc\u00e9's special live performances: in a tribute to [[Michael Jackson]] following his death, and in a tribute to the victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. The song has been [[Cover version|covered]] by many artists, including [[Florence and the Machine]], [[Harper Blynn]], and [[Westlife]]. It was performed on the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]],'' and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian [[soap opera]] ''[[Caminho das \u00cdndias]].''\n\n==Writing and production==\n[[File:Ryan Tedder OneRepublic Austria 3.jpg|Beyonc\u00e9, Bogart, and Tedder ''(pictured)'' composed \"Halo\" in Tedder's music studio in California.|thumb|alt=The portrait of a blonde man. He wears a gray coat and a hat.|upright]]\n\"Halo\" was composed by [[Ryan Tedder]], lead vocalist of [[OneRepublic]], together with [[Evan \"Kidd\" Bogart]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]].<ref name=\"booklet1\"/> In an interview for [[HitQuarters]], Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his [[Achilles tendon]] and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer [[Ray LaMontagne]] was the primary inspiration for \"Halo\". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's \"[[Trouble (Ray LaMontagne album)|Shelter]]\" for Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband [[Jay-Z]], and proposed the title \"Halo\" after hearing Tedder play \"angelic\" [[chord (music)|chords]]. They wrote the song in three hours.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |title=Interview With Evan 'Kidd' Bogart |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=February 8, 2009 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |first=Kimbel |last=Bouwman |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624wuY74C?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Evan_Bogart_Interview.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"bill10053\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/467645/beyonces-30-biggest-billboard-hits|title=Beyonc\u00e9's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits|page=2|first1=Erika|last1=Ramirez|first2=Jason|last2=Lipshutz|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=September 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Simon Cowell]], owner of the music production company [[Syco Entertainment]], Bogart and Tedder intended \"Halo\" for his client, singer [[Leona Lewis]], who could not record the song because of her tight schedule.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> Cowell was upset that Beyonc\u00e9 chose to record the song.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> David Balls, editor of the British media website [[Digital Spy]], asked Tedder during an interview whether \"Halo\" had initially been written for Lewis.<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\"/> Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyonc\u00e9 waited a long time before recording it.<ref name=\"digitalspy.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a189416/tedder-halo-wasnt-written-for-leona.html |title=Music \u2013 News \u2013 Tedder: 'Halo wasn't written for Leona' |publisher=[[Digital Spy]].

What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, \"I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know if you like it enough to consider it\".

He spent most of his career in Virginia's correctional system, and was initially a supporter of [[capital punishment]].  However, beginning in 1999, he served four years in prison for [[perjury]] and [[money laundering]].  This experience, together with the revelation that [[Earl Washington Jr.]], whom Givens had nearly executed in 1985 before his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, was innocent, transformed Givens into an outspoken opponent of the death penalty, which he spent the rest of his life campaigning against.  He died from [[COVID-19]] during the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Early life==\nGivens was born December 3, 1952, in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the youngest of his working-class parents' four children. As a teenager, he witnessed a young woman, whom he had been about to ask to dance, shot to death at a party. He attended [[Johnson C. Smith University]] on a football scholarship, but dropped out after suffering an injury. As a young man, he worked at a [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]] tobacco plant, but lost his job after a fight with a co-worker.

He found the latter method more upsetting,<ref name=\"WP obit\"/> commenting in 2019 that \"[w]hen it comes down to pushing that button, the only thing you could hear was the machine humming, but when it comes down to lethal injection you got the syringe in your hand and you're watching the chemicals go down in a plastic tube into his arm.

He also dedicated himself to campaigning against the death penalty. He served on the board of Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, and on the board of advisors of Death Penalty Action.  He addressed the [[Virginia General Assembly]] in 2010, where he was credited by [[Chap Petersen]] with helping to defeat a bill to expand the death penalty to accomplices of murders, and the World Congress Against the Death Penalty in [[Brussels]] in 2019.  He also authored memoirs, ''Another Day Is Not Promised'', published in 2012.<ref name=\"WP obit\"/> He described his advocacy work as \"a mission from God\".<ref name=\"ABC\"/>\n\n==Death==\nGivens died April 13, 2020, in a hospital in Richmond, from complications of [[COVID-19]].

In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (''they signaled to their partners in the other boat \u2026'' ({{bibleverse||Luke|5:7|NIV}})) but it is not until the next chapter ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:14|NIV}}) that Andrew is named as Simon's brother.

The Acts, as well as a ''Gospel of St Andrew'', appear among rejected books in the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' connected with the name of [[Pope Gelasius I]]. The Acts of Andrew was edited and published by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] in the ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' ([[Leipzig]], 1821), putting it for the first time into the hands of a critical professional readership.

This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \"Andrew preached to the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]], [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]], [[Taurica|Taurians]], and [[Scythians]] and to every region and city, on the [[Black Sea]], both north and south.\"<ref>Peterson, Peter Megill (1958), ''Andrew, Brother of Simon Peter: His History and Legends'', p. 20. E. J. Brill</ref> The version was adopted by the 10th\u201311th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the [[Georgian Chronicles]]. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defense argument to [[George the Hagiorite]] against the encroachments from the [[Church of Antioch|Antiochian church]] authorities on [[autocephaly]] of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]], produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by [[Saint Nino]] and explaining the necessity of the \"second Christening\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.<ref name=\"Rapp\">Rapp, Stephen H.

''[[Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium]]'', vol. 372, subsidia 48. Louvain, 1976.</ref> The Georgian Orthodox Church marks two feast days in honor of Saint Andrew, on 12 May and 13 December. The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a [[public holidays in Georgia (country)|public holiday in Georgia]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nCypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] negotiated his surrender to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.\n\nOther pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.<ref name=\"whatson-northcyprus.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/dipkarpaz/andreas.htm |title=Apostolos Andreas Monastery, Karpaz, North Cyprus |publisher=Whatson-northcyprus.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Apostolos Andreas Monastery''' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) is a [[monastery]] dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of [[Cape Apostolos Andreas]], which is the north-easternmost point of the island of [[Cyprus]], in [[Rizokarpaso]] in the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. The monastery is an important site to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:AndrewFrescoSPOW.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic of St. Andrew|Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at [[St. Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome]]\n\nThe first reference regards the small chapel at [[Luqa]] dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing ''Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul'' was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The ''Martyrdom of Saint Andrew'' on the main altar of the church was painted by [[Mattia Preti]] in 1687.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Pe\u0219terile Sf. Apostol Andrei - detalii 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, [[Constan\u021ba County]]]]\n\n{{main|Saint Andrew in Romania}}\n\nThe official stance of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of [[Dobruja]] ([[Scythia Minor]]) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century.\n\nAccording to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his ''Commentaries on the Genesis'' (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845\u2013865, and Jacobus de Voragine's ''Golden Legend'' (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to [[Scythia Minor]], whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century.\n\nAccording to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of [[protochronism]] which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,<ref>Stan, Lavinia and Turcescu, Lucian. ''Religion and Politics in Post-Communist Romania'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p.48</ref> although this is disputed.\n\n=== East Slavs ===\n[[File:Predskazanie Kiev sv Andrey.jpg|thumb|Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev depicted in [[Radzivill Chronicle]].]]\nTradition regarding the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Early history|early Christian history of Ukraine]] holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day [[Ukraine]], along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has it that he travelled up the [[Dnieper River]] and reached the future location of [[Kiev]], where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|Saint Andrew's Church of Kiev]] currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.<ref>Lytvynchuk, Janna. ''St. Andrew's Church'', p. 7, Kiev: Anateya, 2006, {{ISBN|966-8668-22-7}}</ref> Because of this connection to Kiev, Saint Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] nations descended from the [[Kievan Rus]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], the latter country using the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] on its [[Russian Navy Ensign|naval ensign]]. The third East Slavic nation, [[Belarus]], however, reveres [[Euphrosyne of Polotsk]], a local saint, as its patron instead.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|The [[Saltire]] (or \"Saint Andrew's Cross\") is the national [[flag of Scotland]]]]\n\nSeveral legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from [[Constantinople]] to the place where the modern [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[St Andrews]] stands today ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], ''Cill R\u00ecmhinn''). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and willed to [[Louis XIV of France]], now in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris; the other is the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian Mss]] in the [[British Library]], London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one [[St Regulus|Regulus]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (729\u2013761). The only historical Regulus ([[Riagail]] or Rule) whose name is preserved in the [[St Andrews Cathedral#St Rule's tower|tower of St Rule]] was an Irish monk expelled from [[Ireland]] with Saint [[Columba]]; his dates, however, are c. 573 \u2013 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in [[Galloway]], but on the site of St Andrews.\n\n[[File:St. Andrew carving, c.1500.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Saint Andrew, carving c.1500 in the National Museum of Scotland]]\nAccording legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, [[\u00d3engus II of the Picts|\u00d3engus II]] in AD 832 led an army of [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] into battle against the [[Angles]], led by [[\u00c6thelstan]], near modern-day [[Athelstaneford]], [[East Lothian]]. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. \u00d3engus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the ''crux decussata'' upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, \u00d3engus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the [[flag of Scotland]] on the basis of this legend.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Parker Lawson |authorlink=John Parker Lawson |title=History of the Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse |publisher=H. Courtoy |year=1848 |page= [https://archive.org/details/historyabbeyand01lawsgoog/page/n197 169] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyabbeyand01lawsgoog |quote=battle athelstaneford Andrew. }}</ref> However, there is evidence that Andrew was venerated in Scotland before this.\n\n[[File:Cottage interior, Ryedale Folk Museum.jpg|thumb|Traditional stone fireplace in northern England. The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney, [[Ryedale Folk Museum]], [[Hutton-le-Hole]].]]\nAndrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the [[Synod of Whitby]], when the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]] felt that Columba had been \"outranked\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher ranking patron. The 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]] cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Numerous parish churches in the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in [[Rome]], [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] is dedicated to Saint Andrew.\n\nA local [[superstition]] uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a [[hex sign]] on the fireplaces in northern [[England]] and [[Scotland]] to prevent [[witch]]es from flying down the [[chimney]] and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the [[fireplace]] posts or [[lintel]]s, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a [[witch ball]], although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, and the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.\n\n===Spain===\nA form of St. Andrew's cross called the [[Cross of Burgundy|Cross of Bourgogne]] was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and makes part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco.\n[[File:Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy..jpg|thumb|Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy in Kyiv, Ukraine. The authors are [[Boris Krylov]] and Oles Sydoruk.]]\nIn [[Spain]], Saint Andrew is the patron of several locations: [[San Andr\u00e9s, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andr\u00e9s]] ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]), [[San Andr\u00e9s y Sauces]] ([[La Palma]]), [[Navalmoral de la Mata]] ([[C\u00e1ceres (province)|C\u00e1ceres]]), [[\u00c9ibar]] ([[Guip\u00fazcoa]]), [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]]), [[Pobladura de Pelayo Garc\u00eda]] and [[Pobladura de Yuso]] ([[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]), [[Berlangas de Roa]] ([[Burgos]]), [[Lig\u00fcerzana]] ([[Palencia]]), [[Castillo de Bayuela]] ([[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]), [[Almorad\u00ed]] ([[Alicante]]), [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] ([[Navarra]]), [[San Andr\u00e9s de Palomar]], ([[Barcelona]]), [(Pujalt)] ([Cantalunya)], [[Adamuz]] ([[Province of C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]]) and {{Interlanguage link multi|San Andr\u00e9s (La Rioja)|es|lt=San Andr\u00e9s}} in [[Cameros]] ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:St Andrew the Apostle - Bulgarian icon.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Andrew the Apostle'' by Yoan from Gabrovo, 19th century]]\nAndrew is the [[patron saint]] of several countries and cities including: Barbados, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Ukraine, [[Sarzana]],<ref name=\"cattedraledisarzana.it\">http://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s=200&l=</ref> [[Pienza]]<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb5NDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT300&lpg=PT300 |title=Lonely Planet Florence & Tuscany |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2018 |page=300|isbn=9781787011939 }}</ref> and [[Amalfi]] in Italy, [[Esgueira]] in Portugal, [[Luqa]] in Malta, [[Para\u00f1aque]] in the Philippines and [[Patras]] in Greece.

The saltire is also the [[flag of Tenerife]], the former [[flag of Galicia]] and the [[Russian Navy Ensign]]. The [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, [[William Porcher Miles]], said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device. The [[flag of Alabama|Alabama]] flag also shows that device.\n\nThe [[St Andrew's Day|feast of Andrew]] is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is the [[national day]] of Scotland.

In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (''they signaled to their partners in the other boat \u2026'' ({{bibleverse||Luke|5:7|NIV}})) but it is not until the next chapter ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:14|NIV}}) that Andrew is named as Simon's brother.

He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of [[Fife, Scotland]].

This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \"Andrew preached to the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]], [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]], [[Taurica|Taurians]], and [[Scythians]] and to every region and city, on the [[Black Sea]], both north and south.\"<ref>Peterson, Peter Megill (1958), ''Andrew, Brother of Simon Peter: His History and Legends'', p. 20. E. J. Brill</ref> The version was adopted by the 10th\u201311th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the [[Georgian Chronicles]]. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defense argument to [[George the Hagiorite]] against the encroachments from the [[Church of Antioch|Antiochian church]] authorities on [[autocephaly]] of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]], produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by [[Saint Nino]] and explaining the necessity of the \"second Christening\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.<ref name=\"Rapp\">Rapp, Stephen H.

The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a [[public holidays in Georgia (country)|public holiday in Georgia]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nCypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] negotiated his surrender to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.\n\nOther pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.<ref name=\"whatson-northcyprus.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/dipkarpaz/andreas.htm |title=Apostolos Andreas Monastery, Karpaz, North Cyprus |publisher=Whatson-northcyprus.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Apostolos Andreas Monastery''' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) is a [[monastery]] dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of [[Cape Apostolos Andreas]], which is the north-easternmost point of the island of [[Cyprus]], in [[Rizokarpaso]] in the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. The monastery is an important site to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:AndrewFrescoSPOW.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic of St. Andrew|Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at [[St. Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome]]\n\nThe first reference regards the small chapel at [[Luqa]] dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing ''Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul'' was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The ''Martyrdom of Saint Andrew'' on the main altar of the church was painted by [[Mattia Preti]] in 1687.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Pe\u0219terile Sf. Apostol Andrei - detalii 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, [[Constan\u021ba County]]]]\n\n{{main|Saint Andrew in Romania}}\n\nThe official stance of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of [[Dobruja]] ([[Scythia Minor]]) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century.\n\nAccording to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his ''Commentaries on the Genesis'' (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845\u2013865, and Jacobus de Voragine's ''Golden Legend'' (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to [[Scythia Minor]], whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century.\n\nAccording to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of [[protochronism]] which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,<ref>Stan, Lavinia and Turcescu, Lucian. ''Religion and Politics in Post-Communist Romania'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p.48</ref> although this is disputed.\n\n=== East Slavs ===\n[[File:Predskazanie Kiev sv Andrey.jpg|thumb|Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev depicted in [[Radzivill Chronicle]].]]\nTradition regarding the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Early history|early Christian history of Ukraine]] holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day [[Ukraine]], along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has it that he travelled up the [[Dnieper River]] and reached the future location of [[Kiev]], where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|Saint Andrew's Church of Kiev]] currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.<ref>Lytvynchuk, Janna. ''St. Andrew's Church'', p. 7, Kiev: Anateya, 2006, {{ISBN|966-8668-22-7}}</ref> Because of this connection to Kiev, Saint Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] nations descended from the [[Kievan Rus]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], the latter country using the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] on its [[Russian Navy Ensign|naval ensign]]. The third East Slavic nation, [[Belarus]], however, reveres [[Euphrosyne of Polotsk]], a local saint, as its patron instead.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|The [[Saltire]] (or \"Saint Andrew's Cross\") is the national [[flag of Scotland]]]]\n\nSeveral legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from [[Constantinople]] to the place where the modern [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[St Andrews]] stands today ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], ''Cill R\u00ecmhinn''). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and willed to [[Louis XIV of France]], now in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris; the other is the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian Mss]] in the [[British Library]], London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one [[St Regulus|Regulus]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (729\u2013761). The only historical Regulus ([[Riagail]] or Rule) whose name is preserved in the [[St Andrews Cathedral#St Rule's tower|tower of St Rule]] was an Irish monk expelled from [[Ireland]] with Saint [[Columba]]; his dates, however, are c. 573 \u2013 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in [[Galloway]], but on the site of St Andrews.\n\n[[File:St. Andrew carving, c.1500.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Saint Andrew, carving c.1500 in the National Museum of Scotland]]\nAccording legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, [[\u00d3engus II of the Picts|\u00d3engus II]] in AD 832 led an army of [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] into battle against the [[Angles]], led by [[\u00c6thelstan]], near modern-day [[Athelstaneford]], [[East Lothian]]. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. \u00d3engus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the ''crux decussata'' upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, \u00d3engus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the [[flag of Scotland]] on the basis of this legend.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Parker Lawson |authorlink=John Parker Lawson |title=History of the Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse |publisher=H.

The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney, [[Ryedale Folk Museum]], [[Hutton-le-Hole]].]]\nAndrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the [[Synod of Whitby]], when the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]] felt that Columba had been \"outranked\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher ranking patron. The 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]] cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Numerous parish churches in the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in [[Rome]], [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] is dedicated to Saint Andrew.\n\nA local [[superstition]] uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a [[hex sign]] on the fireplaces in northern [[England]] and [[Scotland]] to prevent [[witch]]es from flying down the [[chimney]] and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the [[fireplace]] posts or [[lintel]]s, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a [[witch ball]], although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, and the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.\n\n===Spain===\nA form of St. Andrew's cross called the [[Cross of Burgundy|Cross of Bourgogne]] was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and makes part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco.\n[[File:Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy..jpg|thumb|Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy in Kyiv, Ukraine.

The saltire is also the [[flag of Tenerife]], the former [[flag of Galicia]] and the [[Russian Navy Ensign]]. The [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, [[William Porcher Miles]], said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device. The [[flag of Alabama|Alabama]] flag also shows that device.\n\nThe [[St Andrew's Day|feast of Andrew]] is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is the [[national day]] of Scotland.

The Big Five consisted of supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Tatjana Patitz. Whether booked as individuals or  as an elite group, each supermodel gained worldwide success and had great influence on the fashion industry. Naomi Campbell was the first black woman to grace the cover of French Vogue, Time, and American Vogue's September issue. Cindy Crawford was the highest paid model on the planet in 1995 per Forbes. Christy Turlington was known for being a reliable model who garnered over 500 covers during her career and most notably, signed a contract with Maybelline for an annual fee of $800,000 for twelve days' work. Linda Evangelista was known as the industry's \"chameleon\" for her ability to suit a multitude of styles. Evangelista also infamously coined the phrase, \"We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day.\" Tatjana Patitz, the last of the Big Five, continues to be regarded as one of the \"original supermodels\" and even after her retirement, she remains in demand periodically by such designer houses as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Chanel. Later in the decade, Tatjana was replaced in the Big Five by supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who is one of the most successful supermodels in the world, holding the record for  the most magazine covers according to The Guinness Book of World Records.\n*Later in the decade, the rise of [[Kate Moss]] shifted the world of fashion when  her entrance onto the scene turned the Big Five into the Big Six. Kate Moss  became one of the nineties' biggest phenomena when, at 14 years of age, she was discovered at [[JFK Airport]]. Her waif-like figure set a new fashion standard that became known as \"[[heroin chic]].\" This was a pale and ghostly look that called for a stick-thin stature and size zero body. Due to Kate's extremely skinny frame, she was often criticized for allegedly promoting [[eating disorder]]s as apparently evidenced by her shots for [[Calvin Klein]].

This late 90s-style bob cut featured a center, side, or zig-zag parting, as opposed to the thick bangs of the early 1990s. The [[feathered hair|Farrah Fawcett hairstyle]] made a comeback, with highlights going hand-in-hand with this revival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-Part-II-1961-1979/Farrah-Fawcett-Look.html |title=Farrah Fawcett Look |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> Other late 1990s haircuts included \"Felicity curls\" (popularized by [[Keri Russell]] in the hit TV show ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]''), the Fishtail Half-Up, and pigtails,<ref name=\"90sHairstylesWomen\" /> as well as the continuation of mid 1990s hairdos.\n\n===Children's and teenager's hairstyles===\n[[File:Tara Lapinski 1998.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Barrette|Butterfly clips]], worn by young girls in the mid and late 90s.]]\nFor teenage boys longer hair was popular in the early to mid-1990s, including collar-length [[curtained hair]], Long, unkempt [[grunge hair]], blond [[surfer hair]] popular among some [[Britpop]] fans, and dreadlocks. During the mid-1990s, the much-ridiculed [[bowl cut]] became a fad among skaters, while hip-hop fans wore a variant of the [[flattop]] known as the [[hi-top fade]]. In the late 1990s, hair was usually buzzed very short for an athletic look, although a few grunge fans grew their hair long in reaction to this.\n\nFor teenage girls and younger children, hair was worn long with heavily teased bangs called \"mall bangs\" which were long fringes covering the forehead. From 1994 and through 2000s they got smaller and somewhat flatter and less poofy and laid closer to the forehead. [[Alice band]]s, [[headband]]s and [[scrunchie]]s of various styles and colors (especially red, navy blue polka dot, plaid and neon) were popular with girls throughout the early and mid 1990s, and they frequently wore them with twin [[pigtails]], or high or high side [[ponytail]]s and [[bangs (hair)|bangs]]. Also hair pulled to the side over one shoulder sometimes in a braid was seen. Many times in combination with bangs. Bangs and ponytail hair style remained popular with girls throughout the 2000s and the 2010s. Bangs are now less poofy and like \"mall bangs\" and lay closer to the forehead. [[Scrunchie|Scrunchies]] are once again popular in the late 2010s.\n\n===Men's hairstyles===\n[[File:Seattle - Pain in the Grass - 1995 - audience member 02.jpg|thumb|175px|Young man in 1995, sporting a short undercut hairstyle.]]\nThe 1990s generally saw the continued popularity of longer hair on men.

More rebellious young men went for longer, unkempt \"grunge\" hair,<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> often with a center parting. The curtained hairstyle was at its peak in popularity, and [[sideburns]] went out of style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/studying-the-history-of-ryan-goslings-hair-part.html |title=Analyzing the History of Ryan Gosling's Ever-Moving Hair Part |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, most professional men over 30 had conservative 1950s style [[bouffant]] haircuts or the Caesar cut.<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" />\n\nBy 1999 it was considered unstylish and unattractive for men and boys to have longer hair. As a result, short hair completely took over. From 1999 onwards, aside from [[curtained hair]] (which was popular throughout the decade), [[spiky hair]],<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> bleached hair,<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> [[crew cuts]], and variants of the [[quiff]] became popular among younger men. Dark haired men dyed their spikes blonde or added wavy blonde streaks, a trend which continued into the early 2000s (decade). Variants of the [[surfer hair]] was popular among rock musicians during that time period. For African-American men, the [[cornrows]] (popularized by former NBA player [[Allen Iverson]]) and [[buzz cut]] were a popular trend that continued into the early 2000s.\n\n==Makeup and cosmetic trends==\n[[File:Chiara Mastroianni.jpg|thumb|140px|Nude and darker shades of [[lipstick]] seemed popular among women throughout the decade. (''[[Chiara Mastroianni]], 1997'')]]\n\nWomen's makeup in the early 1990s primarily consisted of dark red lipstick and neutral eyes.<ref name=\"MakeupHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carefair.com/skincare/history_of_cosmetics_621.html |title=A Brief History of Cosmetics |accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> Around 1992 the \"grunge look\" came into style among younger women and the look was based on dark red lipstick and smudged eyeliner and [[eyeshadow]].

In 1995, nude shades became desirable and women had a broader color palette in brown. Another makeup trend that emerged was matte lipsticks, with deep shades of red and dark wine colors worn as part of night makeup.<ref name=\"Buzzle90sFashion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/1990s-fashion-trends.html |title=1990s Fashion Trends |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> Blue-frosted eye shadow became fashionable,<ref name=\"1995FashionTrends\" /> and was eventually integrated into the Y2K makeup of the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade). Gothic makeup had broken into the mainstream, having been made up of vamp lipstick (or even black lipstick), heavy mascara and eyeliner, often purple-tinted eye shadow (or else very dark blue), and extremely pale foundation. The Gothic makeup remained relevant in the later years of the decade.\n\nBy 1999, glittery, sparkling makeup had come into style.<ref name=\"MakeupFor2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/make-up-for-the-year-2000/ |title=Make-Up For The Year 2000 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> This was called \"Y2K makeup\", consisting of facial glitter and lip gloss. Blue-frosted eye shadow remained a staple of late 1990s makeup, although silver was ideal look. Dark eyeliner was considered bodacious. Pale, shiny lips became desirable, as lip gloss largely replaced lipstick.<ref name=\"MakeupHistory\" /> An alternative for those who did not like metallics were purples and browns.<ref name=\" MakeupFor2000\" /> Goth makeup and Y2K makeup continued into the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].\n\n==Gallery==\nA selection of images related to the period.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:A classic Black pair of Converse All Stars resting on the Black & White Ed.

However, the popularity of [[grunge music|grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] music helped bring the simple, unkempt grunge look to the mainstream by 1992. The [[anti-conformist]] approach to fashion led to the popularization of the [[casual chic]] look that included [[T-shirt]]s, [[jeans]], [[hoodies]], and [[Athletic shoe|sneakers]], a trend which continued into the 2000s.

The Big Five consisted of supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Tatjana Patitz. Whether booked as individuals or  as an elite group, each supermodel gained worldwide success and had great influence on the fashion industry. Naomi Campbell was the first black woman to grace the cover of French Vogue, Time, and American Vogue's September issue. Cindy Crawford was the highest paid model on the planet in 1995 per Forbes. Christy Turlington was known for being a reliable model who garnered over 500 covers during her career and most notably, signed a contract with Maybelline for an annual fee of $800,000 for twelve days' work. Linda Evangelista was known as the industry's \"chameleon\" for her ability to suit a multitude of styles. Evangelista also infamously coined the phrase, \"We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day.\" Tatjana Patitz, the last of the Big Five, continues to be regarded as one of the \"original supermodels\" and even after her retirement, she remains in demand periodically by such designer houses as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Chanel. Later in the decade, Tatjana was replaced in the Big Five by supermodel Claudia Schiffer, who is one of the most successful supermodels in the world, holding the record for  the most magazine covers according to The Guinness Book of World Records.\n*Later in the decade, the rise of [[Kate Moss]] shifted the world of fashion when  her entrance onto the scene turned the Big Five into the Big Six. Kate Moss  became one of the nineties' biggest phenomena when, at 14 years of age, she was discovered at [[JFK Airport]]. Her waif-like figure set a new fashion standard that became known as \"[[heroin chic]].\" This was a pale and ghostly look that called for a stick-thin stature and size zero body. Due to Kate's extremely skinny frame, she was often criticized for allegedly promoting [[eating disorder]]s as apparently evidenced by her shots for [[Calvin Klein]].  Reportedly, posters of Kate Moss were often defaced with graffiti that read \"feed me\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=Fifty years of fashion: new look to now|date=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-07132-9|edition=2. pr.}}</ref>\n\n====Neon colors====\n* In the US, [[Soviet fashion|USSR]],<ref name=\"90s Russian fashion\">[http://rbth.com/arts/2014/04/08/getting_it_right_and_getting_it_wrong_the_heady_style_of_the_heady_1990s_35759.html 90s Russian fashion]</ref> [[African fashion|South Africa]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pdoMBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198&dq=1990s%20geometric%20pattern%20clothing#v=onepage African fashion]</ref> Egypt, and Japan popular trends included bold geometric-print clothing in [[electric blue (color)|electric blue]], orange, fluorescent pink, purple, turquoise<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pinkbluetellingb0000paol/page/95 <!-- quote=1990s neon clothing. --> Pink and Blue]</ref> and the acid green exercise wear<ref>[http://www.acefitness.org/acefit/fitness-programs-article/2828/ACEFit-workout-advice-and-exercise-tips/ Fitness fads]</ref> popularized by [[Lisa Lopes]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A-fKAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA397&dq=1990s%20neon%20clothing#v=onepage&q=1990s%20neon%20clothing Marketing]</ref> of [[TLC (group)|TLC]].

High and High sided [[ponytail]]s continued through most of the decade, especially when playing sports and at the gym. These were worn with a [[scrunchie]] until the late 1990s when [[hair tie]]s began to replace scrunchies. [[Scrunchie|Scrunchies]] are once again popular in the late 2010s. [[Bangs (hair)|Bangs]] remained big throughout the decade, especially the \"mall bangs\" poofy style associated with the early 1990s.

This late 90s-style bob cut featured a center, side, or zig-zag parting, as opposed to the thick bangs of the early 1990s. The [[feathered hair|Farrah Fawcett hairstyle]] made a comeback, with highlights going hand-in-hand with this revival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-Part-II-1961-1979/Farrah-Fawcett-Look.html |title=Farrah Fawcett Look |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> Other late 1990s haircuts included \"Felicity curls\" (popularized by [[Keri Russell]] in the hit TV show ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]''), the Fishtail Half-Up, and pigtails,<ref name=\"90sHairstylesWomen\" /> as well as the continuation of mid 1990s hairdos.\n\n===Children's and teenager's hairstyles===\n[[File:Tara Lapinski 1998.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Barrette|Butterfly clips]], worn by young girls in the mid and late 90s.]]\nFor teenage boys longer hair was popular in the early to mid-1990s, including collar-length [[curtained hair]], Long, unkempt [[grunge hair]], blond [[surfer hair]] popular among some [[Britpop]] fans, and dreadlocks. During the mid-1990s, the much-ridiculed [[bowl cut]] became a fad among skaters, while hip-hop fans wore a variant of the [[flattop]] known as the [[hi-top fade]]. In the late 1990s, hair was usually buzzed very short for an athletic look, although a few grunge fans grew their hair long in reaction to this.\n\nFor teenage girls and younger children, hair was worn long with heavily teased bangs called \"mall bangs\" which were long fringes covering the forehead. From 1994 and through 2000s they got smaller and somewhat flatter and less poofy and laid closer to the forehead. [[Alice band]]s, [[headband]]s and [[scrunchie]]s of various styles and colors (especially red, navy blue polka dot, plaid and neon) were popular with girls throughout the early and mid 1990s, and they frequently wore them with twin [[pigtails]], or high or high side [[ponytail]]s and [[bangs (hair)|bangs]]. Also hair pulled to the side over one shoulder sometimes in a braid was seen. Many times in combination with bangs. Bangs and ponytail hair style remained popular with girls throughout the 2000s and the 2010s. Bangs are now less poofy and like \"mall bangs\" and lay closer to the forehead. [[Scrunchie|Scrunchies]] are once again popular in the late 2010s.\n\n===Men's hairstyles===\n[[File:Seattle - Pain in the Grass - 1995 - audience member 02.jpg|thumb|175px|Young man in 1995, sporting a short undercut hairstyle.]]\nThe 1990s generally saw the continued popularity of longer hair on men. In the early 1990s, [[curtained hair]], [[Mullet (haircut)|mullets]], and [[ponytail]]s were popular.

More rebellious young men went for longer, unkempt \"grunge\" hair,<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> often with a center parting. The curtained hairstyle was at its peak in popularity, and [[sideburns]] went out of style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/studying-the-history-of-ryan-goslings-hair-part.html |title=Analyzing the History of Ryan Gosling's Ever-Moving Hair Part |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> Meanwhile, most professional men over 30 had conservative 1950s style [[bouffant]] haircuts or the Caesar cut.<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" />\n\nBy 1999 it was considered unstylish and unattractive for men and boys to have longer hair. As a result, short hair completely took over. From 1999 onwards, aside from [[curtained hair]] (which was popular throughout the decade), [[spiky hair]],<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> bleached hair,<ref name=\"Crucial'90sMensDos\" /> [[crew cuts]], and variants of the [[quiff]] became popular among younger men. Dark haired men dyed their spikes blonde or added wavy blonde streaks, a trend which continued into the early 2000s (decade). Variants of the [[surfer hair]] was popular among rock musicians during that time period. For African-American men, the [[cornrows]] (popularized by former NBA player [[Allen Iverson]]) and [[buzz cut]] were a popular trend that continued into the early 2000s.\n\n==Makeup and cosmetic trends==\n[[File:Chiara Mastroianni.jpg|thumb|140px|Nude and darker shades of [[lipstick]] seemed popular among women throughout the decade. (''[[Chiara Mastroianni]], 1997'')]]\n\nWomen's makeup in the early 1990s primarily consisted of dark red lipstick and neutral eyes.<ref name=\"MakeupHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.carefair.com/skincare/history_of_cosmetics_621.html |title=A Brief History of Cosmetics |accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> Around 1992 the \"grunge look\" came into style among younger women and the look was based on dark red lipstick and smudged eyeliner and [[eyeshadow]].

In 1995, nude shades became desirable and women had a broader color palette in brown. Another makeup trend that emerged was matte lipsticks, with deep shades of red and dark wine colors worn as part of night makeup.<ref name=\"Buzzle90sFashion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/1990s-fashion-trends.html |title=1990s Fashion Trends |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> Blue-frosted eye shadow became fashionable,<ref name=\"1995FashionTrends\" /> and was eventually integrated into the Y2K makeup of the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade). Gothic makeup had broken into the mainstream, having been made up of vamp lipstick (or even black lipstick), heavy mascara and eyeliner, often purple-tinted eye shadow (or else very dark blue), and extremely pale foundation. The Gothic makeup remained relevant in the later years of the decade.\n\nBy 1999, glittery, sparkling makeup had come into style.<ref name=\"MakeupFor2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/make-up-for-the-year-2000/ |title=Make-Up For The Year 2000 |accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> This was called \"Y2K makeup\", consisting of facial glitter and lip gloss. Blue-frosted eye shadow remained a staple of late 1990s makeup, although silver was ideal look. Dark eyeliner was considered bodacious. Pale, shiny lips became desirable, as lip gloss largely replaced lipstick.<ref name=\"MakeupHistory\" /> An alternative for those who did not like metallics were purples and browns.<ref name=\" MakeupFor2000\" /> Goth makeup and Y2K makeup continued into the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].\n\n==Gallery==\nA selection of images related to the period.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:A classic Black pair of Converse All Stars resting on the Black & White Ed.
