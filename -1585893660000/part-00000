The musicians were not publicly recognized in their era, but were viewed with reverence by industry insiders. They are now considered one of the most successful and prolific session recording units in music history.\n\nMost of the players associated with the Wrecking Crew had formal backgrounds in [[jazz]] or [[classical music]]. The group had no official name in its active years, and it remains a subject of contention whether or not they were referred to as \"the Wrecking Crew\" at the time. Drummer [[Hal Blaine]] popularized the name in his 1990 memoir, attributing it to older musicians who felt that the group's embrace of rock and roll was going to \"wreck\" the music industry.<ref name=\"overture\">{{cite web |last1=Rapka |first1=Linda |title=L.A.

Another unofficial name was \"The First Call Gang\", sometimes used in the 1950s for an early version of the group headed by bassist [[Ray Pohlman]] which featured some of the same musicians.\n\nThe unit coalesced in the early 1960s as the de facto [[house band]] for [[Phil Spector]] and helped realize his [[Wall of Sound]] production style.<ref>Blaine, Hal and David Goggin, ''Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew: The Story of the World\u2019s Most Recorded Musician'', MixBooks, Emeryville, California, 1990; pp. 57-60</ref> They subsequently became the most requested session musicians in Los Angeles, playing behind many popular recording artists including [[Jan and Dean]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Mamas and the Papas]], [[the 5th Dimension]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Nancy Sinatra]]. The musicians were sometimes used as \"ghost players\" on recordings credited to rock groups, such as [[the Byrds]]' debut rendition of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" (1965), the first two albums by [[the Monkees]], and [[the Beach Boys]]' 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. \n\nThe Wrecking Crew's contributions to so many hit recordings went largely unnoticed until the publication of Blaine's memoir and the attention that followed. Keyboardist [[Leon Russell]] and guitarist [[Glen Campbell]] were members who became popular solo acts, while Blaine is reputed to have played on more than 140 top-ten hits, including approximately 40 number-one hits.  Other musicians who formed the unit's ranks were drummer [[Earl Palmer]], saxophonist [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], guitarist [[Tommy Tedesco]], and keyboardist [[Larry Knechtel]], who became a member of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]. Blaine and Palmer were among the inaugural \"sidemen\" inductees to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2000, and the entire Wrecking Crew was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007.  In 2008 and 2015 they were the subject of the documentary ''[[The_Wrecking_Crew_(2008_film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\n==Origins==\n===Historical context and music backgrounds===\nIn the era when the Wrecking Crew was in demand, session players were usually active in local recording scenes concentrated in places such as [[New York City]], [[Nashville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Detroit]], and [[Muscle Shoals]], as well as Los Angeles, the Wrecking Crew's base of operations.<ref name=\"Savona (Producers)\">{{cite book|last=Savona|first=Anthony|title=Console Confessions: The Great Music Producers in Their Own Words|date=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisico, CA 94107|isbn=978-0-87930-860-5|pages=36\u201338|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIfrupI2_qsC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=new+york+recording+scene+1960s&source=bl&ots=bQQ1coqee3&sig=P6uV9mARbzfdrdW5nXPU7XM_kG8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzyYWVlLrKAhVBNz4KHTHTDc0Q6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=new%20york%20recording%20scene%201960s&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Memphis/Nashville/Muscle Shoals\">'''Source A:''' {{cite web|title=The Nashville 'A' Team|url=http://www.musicianshalloffame.com/2007-inductees/the-nashville-a-team/|publisher=[[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126203600/http://www.musicianshalloffame.com/2007-inductees/the-nashville-a-team/|archivedate=January 26, 2016}} '''Source B:''' {{cite web|title=Motown Sound: Funk Brothers|url=https://www.motownmuseum.org/motown-sound/the-artists/funk-brothers/|publisher=[[Motown Museum]]|accessdate=January 20, 2016}} '''Source C:''' {{cite web|last=Brown|first=Mick|title=Deep Soul: How Muscle Shoals Became Music's Most Unlikely Hit Factory|url=http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/projects/muscle-shoals/index.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=January 20, 2016|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=2\u20135, 110, 175\u2013176}}  Each local scene had its circle of \"A-list\" session musicians, such as [[The Nashville A-Team]] that played on numerous country and rock hits of the era, the two groups of musicians in Memphis, [[the Memphis Boys]] and the musicians who backed [[Stax Records|Stax/Volt]] recordings, and [[the Funk Brothers]] in Detroit, who played on many [[Motown]] recordings.<ref name=\"Memphis/Nashville/Muscle Shoals\"/>{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=2\u20135, 110, 175\u2013176}}\n\nAt the time, multi-tracking equipment, though common, was less elaborate, and instrumental backing tracks were often recorded \"hot\" with an ensemble playing live in the studio.<ref name=\"NAIM (60s recording)\">{{cite web|title=Recording studios \u2013 Why Can Recordings Made in the e.g. 1960s Sound Good in 2011?|url=http://forums.naimaudio.com/topic/recording-studios---why-can-recordings-made-in-the-eg-1960s-sound-good-in-2011?reply=12688757306897171|publisher=NAIM|accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref> Musicians had to be available \"on call\" when producers needed a part to fill a last-minute time slot.<ref name=\"Andrews (Session Musicians)\">{{cite web|last=Andrews|first=Evan|title=Top 10 Session Musicians and Studio Bands|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-session-musicians-and-studio-bands.php|publisher=Toptenz.net|accessdate=January 21, 2016|date=July 1, 2011}}</ref>  Los Angeles was then considered the top recording destination in the United States\u2014consequently studios were constantly booked around the clock, and session time was highly sought after and expensive.<ref name=\"JazzWax (Byrds/studio expense)\">{{cite web|title=The Byrds: Who Played What?|url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2012/09/the-byrds-who-played-what.html|publisher=JazzWax|accessdate=January 21, 2016|date=September 4, 2012}}</ref>  Songs had to be recorded quickly in the fewest possible takes.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=2\u20135, 110, 175\u2013176}}<ref name=\"Farber (Wreck Crew)\">{{cite news|last=Farber|first=Jim|title=The Wrecking Crew Documentary Profiles the Secret Players Behind Many 1960s and '70s Rock Hits|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/meet-secret-musicians-made-1960s-great-article-1.2143270|accessdate=January 21, 2016|location=New York|newspaper=Daily News|date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>  In this environment, Los Angeles producers and record executives had little patience for needless expense or wasted time and depended on the service of reliable standby musicians who could be counted on to record in a variety of styles with minimal practice or takes, and deliver hits on short order.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=2\u20135, 110, 175\u2013176}}<ref name=\"Andrews (Session Musicians)\"/><ref name=\"Laurier (Wreck.

In fact it was getting downright heavy.  In the aftermath of the recent Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. slayings, the bloody Tet Offensive in Viet Nam, and the ever-growing level of campus unrest at universities around the country, Top 40 radio gradually began to lose step with the times\".{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=212}}  Hartman mentions that the runaway success that year of [[Richard Harris]]' elaborate seven-minute epic hit, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", written by [[Jimmy Webb]] and featuring the Wrecking Crew's intricate backing, might have been another seed in their eventual decline:\n\n{{quote|Webb's creation additionally generated another unexpected consequence, one that would begin to subtly affect the Wrecking Crew's livelihood. Because the song had broken through the AM radio barrier, it had suddenly made it okay for lengthier songs to make the playlist. And the longer each song, the fewer minutes left during each hour for the station to play ''other'' songs. That was the unfair, mathematical irony of the whole equation; the Wrecking Crew had just played their hearts out on an all-time award-winning hit, yet its very success contributed toward a drop in the total number of songs making it on the air. And with fewer songs finding airtime, there gradually evolved a diminishing number of rock-and-roll recording dates for them to play on.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=212\u2013215}}}}\n\nThe Wrecking Crew remained in demand in the early 1970s, even enjoying several hits, but by the end of 1973 they began to experience a downturn in bookings, as a series of changes in the recording industry began to take hold.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|p=247}}  Unlike earlier bands/artists such as [[the Monkees]], [[the Grass Roots]], [[The Partridge Family]] and [[David Cassidy]] that often utilized the Wrecking Crew for backing tracks (and as a backing band for Cassidy's earliest concert tours of America in 1971/2), rock groups in the early to mid 1970s began to stipulate in their recording contracts that they be allowed to play their own instruments on records.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=247\u2013248}} Younger session players such as [[Larry Carlton]], [[Andrew Gold]], [[Danny Kortchmar]], [[Waddy Wachtel]], [[Russ Kunkel]], [[Jeff Porcaro]], [[Leland Sklar]], and [[Jim Keltner]] had a more contemporary sound, better-suited to the changing musical tastes of the decade.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|p=248}}  By the mid-1970s, technological advances such as 16-track and 24-track tape recording machines and [[Mix automation|automated]] large-format multi-channel [[Mixing console|consoles]] made it viable for instruments to be recorded, often close-miked, onto separate tracks individually, reducing the need to hire ensembles to play live in the studio.{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=148, 253}}<ref name=\"MPG (70s recording)\">{{cite web|title=Technology and the Audio Engineer Part II|url=http://www.music-production-guide.com/audio-engineer-and-technology-p2.html|website=MPG: Music Production School|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Rumsey/McCromick (70s record. auto.)\">{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim |title=Sound and Recording: Applications and Theory|date=2014|publisher=Focal Press, Taylor and Francis Group|location=New York and London |isbn=978-0-415-84337-9|page=154|edition=Seventh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPbpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=automated+recording+consoles+faders+1970s+NECAM#v=onepage&q=automated%20recording%20consoles%20faders%201970s%20NECAM&f=false|chapter=Five}}</ref> [[Synthesizer]]s could approximate the sound of practically any instrument.

The musicians were not publicly recognized in their era, but were viewed with reverence by industry insiders. They are now considered one of the most successful and prolific session recording units in music history.\n\nMost of the players associated with the Wrecking Crew had formal backgrounds in [[jazz]] or [[classical music]]. The group had no official name in its active years, and it remains a subject of contention whether or not they were referred to as \"the Wrecking Crew\" at the time. Drummer [[Hal Blaine]] popularized the name in his 1990 memoir, attributing it to older musicians who felt that the group's embrace of rock and roll was going to \"wreck\" the music industry.<ref name=\"overture\">{{cite web |last1=Rapka |first1=Linda |title=L.A.

Another unofficial name was \"The First Call Gang\", sometimes used in the 1950s for an early version of the group headed by bassist [[Ray Pohlman]] which featured some of the same musicians.\n\nThe unit coalesced in the early 1960s as the de facto [[house band]] for [[Phil Spector]] and helped realize his [[Wall of Sound]] production style.<ref>Blaine, Hal and David Goggin, ''Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew: The Story of the World\u2019s Most Recorded Musician'', MixBooks, Emeryville, California, 1990; pp. 57-60</ref> They subsequently became the most requested session musicians in Los Angeles, playing behind many popular recording artists including [[Jan and Dean]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Mamas and the Papas]], [[the 5th Dimension]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Nancy Sinatra]]. The musicians were sometimes used as \"ghost players\" on recordings credited to rock groups, such as [[the Byrds]]' debut rendition of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" (1965), the first two albums by [[the Monkees]], and [[the Beach Boys]]' 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]''. \n\nThe Wrecking Crew's contributions to so many hit recordings went largely unnoticed until the publication of Blaine's memoir and the attention that followed. Keyboardist [[Leon Russell]] and guitarist [[Glen Campbell]] were members who became popular solo acts, while Blaine is reputed to have played on more than 140 top-ten hits, including approximately 40 number-one hits.  Other musicians who formed the unit's ranks were drummer [[Earl Palmer]], saxophonist [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], guitarist [[Tommy Tedesco]], and keyboardist [[Larry Knechtel]], who became a member of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]. Blaine and Palmer were among the inaugural \"sidemen\" inductees to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2000, and the entire Wrecking Crew was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2007.

In fact it was getting downright heavy.  In the aftermath of the recent Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. slayings, the bloody Tet Offensive in Viet Nam, and the ever-growing level of campus unrest at universities around the country, Top 40 radio gradually began to lose step with the times\".{{sfn|Hartman|2012|pp=212}}  Hartman mentions that the runaway success that year of [[Richard Harris]]' elaborate seven-minute epic hit, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", written by [[Jimmy Webb]] and featuring the Wrecking Crew's intricate backing, might have been another seed in their eventual decline:\n\n{{quote|Webb's creation additionally generated another unexpected consequence, one that would begin to subtly affect the Wrecking Crew's livelihood. Because the song had broken through the AM radio barrier, it had suddenly made it okay for lengthier songs to make the playlist. And the longer each song, the fewer minutes left during each hour for the station to play ''other'' songs. That was the unfair, mathematical irony of the whole equation; the Wrecking Crew had just played their hearts out on an all-time award-winning hit, yet its very success contributed toward a drop in the total number of songs making it on the air.

In ''The Characters'' (c. 319 BC), Theophrastus introduced the \"character sketch\", which became the core of \"the Character as a genre\". It included 30 character types. Each type is said to be an illustration of an individual who represents a group, characterized by his most prominent trait. The Theophrastan types are as follows:\n{| border=\"0\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Insincere Man \n* The Flatterer \n* The Garrulous Man \n* The Boor \n* The Complacent Man \n* The Man without Moral Feeling \n* The Talkative Man \n* The Fabricator \n* The Shamelessly Greedy Man \n* The Pennypincher\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Offensive Man \n* The Hapless Man \n* The Officious Man \n* The Absent-Minded Man\n* The Unsociable Man \n* The Superstitious Man \n* The Faultfinder \n* The Suspicious Man \n* The Repulsive Man \n* The Unpleasant Man \n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Man of Petty Ambition \n* The Stingy Man\n* The Show-Off \n* The Arrogant Man\n* The Coward \n* The Oligarchical Man \n* The Late Learner \n* The Slanderer\n* The Lover of Bad Company \n* The Basely Covetous Man \n|}\n\nIt is unclear from where Theophrastus derived these types, but many strongly resemble those from Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Despite the fact that Theophrastus sought to portray character types and not individuals, some of the sketches may have been drawn from observations of actual persons in Athenian public life. Although the preface of the work implies the intention to catalogue \"human nature, associate[ed] with all sorts and conditions of men and contrast[ed] in minute detail the good and bad among them\", many other possible types are left unrepresented. \n\nThese omissions are especially noticeable because each of the thirty characters represents a negative trait (\"the bad\"); some scholars have therefore suspected that another half of the work, covering the positive types (\"the good\"), once existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This preface, however, is certainly fictitious, i.e. added in later times, and cannot therefore be a source of any allegation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nowadays many scholars also believe that the definitions found in the beginning of each sketch are later additions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n====New Comedy====\n{{Main|Ancient Greek comedy}}\nNew Comedy was the first theatrical form to have access to Theophrastus' Characters. [[Menander]] was said to be a student of Theophrastus, and has been remembered for his prototypical cooks, merchants, farmers and slave characters. Although we have few extant works of the New Comedy, the titles of Menander's plays alone have a \"Theophrastan ring\": ''The Fisherman'', ''The Farmer'', ''The Superstitious Man'', ''The Peevish Man'', ''The Promiser'', ''The Heiress'', ''The Priestess'', ''The False Accuser'', ''The Misogynist'', ''The Hated Man'', ''The Shipmaster'', ''The Slave'', ''The Concubine'', ''The Soldiers'', ''The Widow'', and ''The Noise-Shy Man''.\n\n====Mimistry====\nAnother early form that illustrates the beginnings of the Character is the [[mime artist|mime]]. Greco-Roman mimic playlets often told the stock story of the fat, stupid husband who returned home to find his wife in bed with a lover, stock characters in themselves. Although the mimes were not confined to playing stock characters, the mimus calvus was an early reappearing character. Mimus calvus resembled Maccus, the buffoon from the [[Atellan Farce]]. The Atellan Farce is highly significant in the study of the Character because it contained the first true stock characters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Atellan Farce employed four fool types. In addition to Maccus, Bucco, the glutton, Pappus, the na\u00efve old man (the fool victim), and [[Dossennus]], the cunning hunchback (the trickster). A fifth type, in the form of the additional character Manducus, the chattering jawed pimp, also may have appeared in the Atellan Farce, possibly out of an adaptation of Dossennus. The Roman mime, as well, was a stock fool, closely related to the Atellan fools.\n\n===Roman input===\n\n====Plautus====\nThe [[Roman Republic|Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]] drew from Atellan Farce as well as the Greek Old and New Comedy. He expanded the four types of Atellan Farce to eight (not quite as distinct as the farcical types):\n* Old man, probably a [[miser]] \u2013 ''senex iratus''\n* Young man in love, possibly the miser's son, who rebels against authority \u2013 ''adulescens amator''\n* [[Tricky slave|Clever or cunning slave]] \u2013 ''servus callidus''\n* [[Stupidity|Stupid]] slave \u2013 ''servus stultus''\n* Hanger-on ([[parasite]]) or [[flattery|flatterer]] \u2013 ''parasitus''\n* [[Courtesan]] \u2013 ''meretrix''\n* [[Slave dealer]] or [[pimp]] \u2013 ''leno''\n* [[Braggart]] [[soldier]] \u2013 ''[[Miles Gloriosus]]'' note; Swaggering Soldier\n\nPlautus's fool was either the slave or the parasite.\n\n====La\u00ebrtius====\nIn revision of Theophrastus, [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] published ''Ethical Characters'' (Circa 230 BC), sparking interest in two lines of study. The first is that of the character book. Imitators of Theophrastus including Satyrus Atheneus, [[Heracleides Ponticus]], [[Lycon (mythology)|Lycon]], and [[Publius Rutilius Lupus|Rutilius Lupus]] wrote their own character sketches. Circa 212 BC, [[Aristo of Ceos|Ariston]]'s discourse on morality included several proud Character types and mimicked the Theophrastan style. Following [[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]]'s work on \"Self seeking Affability\" and Ariston's characters, evidence of acquaintance with the genre is present, however popularity of the portrait over the generalized stock figures in increasing. This may explain the gap of time from the beginning of the Common Era to the 16th century marked by an absence of character sketching.\n\nThe second field is the study of nomenclature. As the Character rose as a literary genre, many terms were coined in attempt to place labels on the new subject. The translation Theophrastus' title is based on the terms ''charassein'' and ''Charakter'', associated with the stamping of an impression. [[Rhetorica ad Herennium]] (c. 20 BC), attributed to [[Cicero]], split the character up into two qualities: ''effictio'', the description of physical appearance, and ''notation'', the nature of man. Later in his [[De Inventione]], Cicero divided the character, or ''conformation'' as he called it, into eleven points: name, nature (''natura''), way of life (''victus''), fortune (''fortuna''), physical appearance (''habitus''), passions (''affectio''), interests (''studium''), reasons for doing things (''consilium''), one's deeds (''factum''), what happens to one (''casus''), one's discourses (''orationes''). \n\n[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], too, played a part in providing labels for the new genre in his [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|Epistulae Morale]], using the terms ''ethologia'' and ''characterismos'' for characteristic conduct of moral types. Circa 93 AD, [[Quintilian]]'s [[Institutio Oratoria]] discussed the effect of personality on rhetoric and in so doing, coined the terms ''ethopoeia'', an orator's imitation of another person's character or habits, and [[prosopopoeia]], the same thing, but with a dramatization of the person as well as the giving of his words. Other terms conceived in the period include ''figurae sententiarum'' and ''descriptio personae''. [[Decorum]], the rhetorical principle that an individual's words and subject matter are appropriately matched, also became a relevant term, and would remain significant into the [[Renaissance]].\n\n====Supersession by philosophy====\nThe Romans' \"perverse admiration for decorum\"{{Cite quote|date=January 2014}} is in part responsible for the deterioration and the resulting blackout period of the Character genre. During this blackout, the Character smoldered under the philosophies of such men as [[Horace]]. In the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] (c. 18 BC), Horace drew pictures of typical men at various ages, from childhood to old age. Horace's belief that \"what is typical of a class should be observable in the individual\" was illustrated in his epistles classifying [[Achilles]] as a man of rage and love, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] an impractical lover, and [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] the model of virtue and wisdom. Others, such as [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch|Aphthonius]], and [[Priscian]], shared this belief and sought to explore the workings of human nature.\n\n{{See also|Theatre of ancient Rome#Stock characters in Roman comedy}}\n\n===Other countries===\nStock characters also feature heavily in the comic traditions of [[Ky\u014dgen]] in Japan and [[Commedia dell'arte]] in Italy; in the latter they are known as ''tipi fissi'' (fixed [human] types).\n\n==Academic analysis==\nAccording to [[Dwight V. Swain]], a creative writing professor and prolific fiction author, all characters begin as stock characters and are fleshed out only as far as needed to advance the plot. <ref>Swain, Dwight V. ''Creating Characters: How to Build Story People'' Writers Digest Books, 1990</ref>  E. Graham McKinley says \"there is general agreement on the importance to drama of 'stock' characters. This notion has been considerably explored in film theory, where feminists have argued, female stock characters are only stereotypes (child/woman, whore, <!--Originally cited.

This stock character provides pathos as yet another counterpoint to the plays' comic business and royal pomp.\"<ref>Andrew Griffin, Helen Ostovich, and Holger Schott Syme, ''Locating the Queen's Men, 1583-1603: Material Practices and Conditions of ...''

She is an ideal foil for the ill mannered, uncivilised hero. In American literature and film, the spinster from East \u2013 generally Boston \u2013 has some stock attributes.\" Polly Welts Kaufman shows that the schoolma'am's  \"genteel poverty, unbending morality, education, and independent ways make her character a useful [[foil (literature)|foil]] for the two other female stock characters in Western literature: the [[Whore|prostitute with the heart of gold]] and the long-suffering farmer's wife.'\"<ref>Tara Brabazon, ''Ladies who lunge: celebrating difficult women'' (2002), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdIjOrSa9ZUC&pg=PA147&dq=%22female+stock+characters%22&cd=9#v=onepage&q=%22female%20stock%20characters%22&f=false 147].</ref>\n===American film===\nIn American popular films, there a wide range of stock characters, which are typically used as non-speaking [[extra (acting)|extra]]s in the background, [[bit part]]s with a single line, minor secondary/supporting roles, or major secondary/supporting roles.<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 4 </ref> Stock characters in American films have changed over the decades. A 1930s or 1940's films' stock characters include newspaper vendors, ice  vendors, street sweepers, and cigarette girls; in contrast, a 1990s film has homeless \"[[Homelessness|bag ladies]]\", pimps, plainclothes police, business women, and Black and Hispanic characters.<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 5 </ref>\n\nA criticism of the way stock characters are used in American in films is that some racial and ethnic stereotypes used in the past were offensive, such as the way Blacks were depicted as \"lazy\" and Japanese people were shown as \"treacherous, myopic and buck-toothed\". In 1990, the new Black  stock character is the \"street-smart\" African-American and the new Japanese stock type is the \"camera-happy tourist\". <ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 3 </ref> Other groups that have been depicted with negative stereotypes include women, Native Americans, Hispanics, Arabs, Jews, and Italians.<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 3 </ref>\nSome stock characters only last for a decade or so before being abandoned, such as the overweight Communist cell leader character in the 1950s or the African-American [[Black Panther Party]] militant character that was common in 1970s.<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 5 </ref>\n\nEven in timeless occupations, the person in the job has changed, reflecting cultural and demographic changes.\n<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''. Popular Press, 1990. p. 5 </ref> For example, in a 1990 film, a hairdresser is often depicted as gay (rather than French in earlier decades), a gardener is often Asian or Hispanic, bar staff may be Black, and maids, often Black in previous eras, tended to be Hispanic.<ref>Loukides, Paul; Linda K. Fuller. ''Beyond the Stars: Stock characters in American popular film, Volume 1''.

''Latinas and Latinos on TV: Colorblind Comedy in the Post-racial Network Era''.

''Queer TV: Theories, Histories''.

Although the preface of the work implies the intention to catalogue \"human nature, associate[ed] with all sorts and conditions of men and contrast[ed] in minute detail the good and bad among them\", many other possible types are left unrepresented. \n\nThese omissions are especially noticeable because each of the thirty characters represents a negative trait (\"the bad\"); some scholars have therefore suspected that another half of the work, covering the positive types (\"the good\"), once existed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This preface, however, is certainly fictitious, i.e. added in later times, and cannot therefore be a source of any allegation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nowadays many scholars also believe that the definitions found in the beginning of each sketch are later additions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n====New Comedy====\n{{Main|Ancient Greek comedy}}\nNew Comedy was the first theatrical form to have access to Theophrastus' Characters. [[Menander]] was said to be a student of Theophrastus, and has been remembered for his prototypical cooks, merchants, farmers and slave characters. Although we have few extant works of the New Comedy, the titles of Menander's plays alone have a \"Theophrastan ring\": ''The Fisherman'', ''The Farmer'', ''The Superstitious Man'', ''The Peevish Man'', ''The Promiser'', ''The Heiress'', ''The Priestess'', ''The False Accuser'', ''The Misogynist'', ''The Hated Man'', ''The Shipmaster'', ''The Slave'', ''The Concubine'', ''The Soldiers'', ''The Widow'', and ''The Noise-Shy Man''.\n\n====Mimistry====\nAnother early form that illustrates the beginnings of the Character is the [[mime artist|mime]]. Greco-Roman mimic playlets often told the stock story of the fat, stupid husband who returned home to find his wife in bed with a lover, stock characters in themselves. Although the mimes were not confined to playing stock characters, the mimus calvus was an early reappearing character. Mimus calvus resembled Maccus, the buffoon from the [[Atellan Farce]]. The Atellan Farce is highly significant in the study of the Character because it contained the first true stock characters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Atellan Farce employed four fool types. In addition to Maccus, Bucco, the glutton, Pappus, the na\u00efve old man (the fool victim), and [[Dossennus]], the cunning hunchback (the trickster). A fifth type, in the form of the additional character Manducus, the chattering jawed pimp, also may have appeared in the Atellan Farce, possibly out of an adaptation of Dossennus. The Roman mime, as well, was a stock fool, closely related to the Atellan fools.\n\n===Roman input===\n\n====Plautus====\nThe [[Roman Republic|Roman]] playwright [[Plautus]] drew from Atellan Farce as well as the Greek Old and New Comedy. He expanded the four types of Atellan Farce to eight (not quite as distinct as the farcical types):\n* Old man, probably a [[miser]] \u2013 ''senex iratus''\n* Young man in love, possibly the miser's son, who rebels against authority \u2013 ''adulescens amator''\n* [[Tricky slave|Clever or cunning slave]] \u2013 ''servus callidus''\n* [[Stupidity|Stupid]] slave \u2013 ''servus stultus''\n* Hanger-on ([[parasite]]) or [[flattery|flatterer]] \u2013 ''parasitus''\n* [[Courtesan]] \u2013 ''meretrix''\n* [[Slave dealer]] or [[pimp]] \u2013 ''leno''\n* [[Braggart]] [[soldier]] \u2013 ''[[Miles Gloriosus]]'' note; Swaggering Soldier\n\nPlautus's fool was either the slave or the parasite.\n\n====La\u00ebrtius====\nIn revision of Theophrastus, [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] published ''Ethical Characters'' (Circa 230 BC), sparking interest in two lines of study. The first is that of the character book. Imitators of Theophrastus including Satyrus Atheneus, [[Heracleides Ponticus]], [[Lycon (mythology)|Lycon]], and [[Publius Rutilius Lupus|Rutilius Lupus]] wrote their own character sketches. Circa 212 BC, [[Aristo of Ceos|Ariston]]'s discourse on morality included several proud Character types and mimicked the Theophrastan style. Following [[Philodemus|Philodemus of Gadara]]'s work on \"Self seeking Affability\" and Ariston's characters, evidence of acquaintance with the genre is present, however popularity of the portrait over the generalized stock figures in increasing. This may explain the gap of time from the beginning of the Common Era to the 16th century marked by an absence of character sketching.\n\nThe second field is the study of nomenclature. As the Character rose as a literary genre, many terms were coined in attempt to place labels on the new subject. The translation Theophrastus' title is based on the terms ''charassein'' and ''Charakter'', associated with the stamping of an impression. [[Rhetorica ad Herennium]] (c. 20 BC), attributed to [[Cicero]], split the character up into two qualities: ''effictio'', the description of physical appearance, and ''notation'', the nature of man. Later in his [[De Inventione]], Cicero divided the character, or ''conformation'' as he called it, into eleven points: name, nature (''natura''), way of life (''victus''), fortune (''fortuna''), physical appearance (''habitus''), passions (''affectio''), interests (''studium''), reasons for doing things (''consilium''), one's deeds (''factum''), what happens to one (''casus''), one's discourses (''orationes''). \n\n[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], too, played a part in providing labels for the new genre in his [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|Epistulae Morale]], using the terms ''ethologia'' and ''characterismos'' for characteristic conduct of moral types. Circa 93 AD, [[Quintilian]]'s [[Institutio Oratoria]] discussed the effect of personality on rhetoric and in so doing, coined the terms ''ethopoeia'', an orator's imitation of another person's character or habits, and [[prosopopoeia]], the same thing, but with a dramatization of the person as well as the giving of his words. Other terms conceived in the period include ''figurae sententiarum'' and ''descriptio personae''. [[Decorum]], the rhetorical principle that an individual's words and subject matter are appropriately matched, also became a relevant term, and would remain significant into the [[Renaissance]].\n\n====Supersession by philosophy====\nThe Romans' \"perverse admiration for decorum\"{{Cite quote|date=January 2014}} is in part responsible for the deterioration and the resulting blackout period of the Character genre. During this blackout, the Character smoldered under the philosophies of such men as [[Horace]]. In the [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]] (c. 18 BC), Horace drew pictures of typical men at various ages, from childhood to old age. Horace's belief that \"what is typical of a class should be observable in the individual\" was illustrated in his epistles classifying [[Achilles]] as a man of rage and love, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] an impractical lover, and [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] the model of virtue and wisdom. Others, such as [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]], [[Aphthonius of Antioch|Aphthonius]], and [[Priscian]], shared this belief and sought to explore the workings of human nature.\n\n{{See also|Theatre of ancient Rome#Stock characters in Roman comedy}}\n\n===Other countries===\nStock characters also feature heavily in the comic traditions of [[Ky\u014dgen]] in Japan and [[Commedia dell'arte]] in Italy; in the latter they are known as ''tipi fissi'' (fixed [human] types).\n\n==Academic analysis==\nAccording to [[Dwight V.

[[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \"fundamental\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]] interpretation of the Bible.

In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S. Kidd]], \"''seasons of revival'', or ''outpourings of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]'', and on ''converted sinners experiencing God's love personally''\" [emphasis in original].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=xiv}} Evangelicals believed in the \"[[new birth]]\"\u2014a discernible moment of conversion\u2014and that it was normal for a Christian to have [[assurance of faith]].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 66}} While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\".{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}} \n\nIts emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an [[egalitarian]] streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} The revivals influenced all the major Protestant denominations and turned most Protestants into evangelicals.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=25}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nKentucky was the location of the [[Revival of 1800]] led by Presbyterian minister [[James McGready]]. It was here that the traditional Scottish communion season began to evolve into the American [[camp meeting]].{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=58}} A year later, the [[Cane Ridge Revival]] led by [[Barton Stone]] lasted a week and drew crowds of 20,000 people from the thinly populated frontier. At Cane Ridge, many converts experienced religious ecstasy and \"bodily agitations\".{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}} Some worshipers caught [[holy laughter]], barked like dogs, experienced convulsions, fell into trances, danced, shouted or were [[slain in the Spirit]]. Similar things had occurred in other revivals, but they were more intense at Cane Ridge. This revival was the origin of the [[Stone-Campbell Movement]], from which the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Disciples of Christ]] denominations originate.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=72}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}}\n\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] was the most successful at gaining converts. It enthusiastically adopted camp meetings as a regular part of church life and devoted resources to evangelizing the western frontier. Itinerant ministers known as [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] traveled hundreds of miles each year to preach and serve scattered congregations. The Methodists took a democratic and egalitarian approach to ministry, allowing poor and uneducated young men to become circuit riders. The Baptists also expanded rapidly. Like the Methodists, Baptists also sent out itinerant ministers, often with little education.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n\nUnlike the First Great Awakening which was largely [[Calvinist]] in orientation, the Second Great Awakening was more theologically diverse with [[Arminians]] (whose theology allowed for some [[Free will in theology|free will]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]) playing important roles.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\").

[[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \"fundamental\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]] interpretation of the Bible. These three categories are more fluid than Hunter's, so an individual could identify with only one or all three.{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[John C. Green]], a senior fellow at the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]], used polling data to separate evangelicals into three broad camps, which he labels as ''traditionalist'', ''centrist'' and ''modernist'':<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{Cite news| title=Evangelicals Debate the Meaning of 'Evangelical' | last=Luo | first=Michael |date=April 16, 2006 | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/weekinreview/16luo.html?_r=1&adxnnlx=1145227368-p%20hJwvCXS0qceSTw%20jLi8w&pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\n# Traditionalist evangelicals, characterized by high affinity for certain Protestant beliefs, (especially [[penal substitution]]ary atonement, [[Sola fide|justification by faith]], the [[Sola scriptura|authority of scripture]], the [[priesthood of all believers]], etc.) which, when fused with the highly political milieu of Western culture (especially American culture), has resulted in the political disposition that has been labeled the Christian right, with figures like [[Jerry Falwell]] and the television evangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as its most visible spokesmen.\n# Centrist evangelicals, described as socially conservative, mostly avoiding politics, who still support much of traditional Christian theology.\n# Modernist evangelicals, a small minority in the movement, have lower levels of church-attendance and \"have much more diversity in their beliefs\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nHistorian [[Molly Worthen]] writes that \"History\u2014rather than theology or politics\u2014is the most useful tool for pinning down today\u2019s evangelicals.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}} She finds that evangelicals share common origins in the religious revivals and moral crusades of the 18th and 19th centuries. She writes that \"Evangelical catchphrases like 'Bible-believing' and '[[born again]]' are modern translations of the [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]]' slogan ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and Pietists' emphasis on internal spiritual transformation.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}}\n\n==History==\n===18th century===\n[[File:Jonathan Edwards.jpg|thumb|upright|Jonathan Edwards was the most influential evangelical theologian in America during the 18th century{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}]]\n\nThe roots of American evangelicalism lie in the merger of three older [[Protestant]] traditions: New England [[Puritanism]], Continental [[Pietism]] and Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterianism]].{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Within their [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]], Puritans promoted experimental or experiential religion, arguing that saving [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] required an inward transformation.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=31}} This led Puritans to demand evidence of a [[Puritans#Conversion|conversion experience]] (in the form of a [[conversion narrative]]) before a convert was admitted to full church membership.{{Sfn|Youngs|1998|pp=40\u201341}} In the 1670s and 1680s, Puritan clergy began to promote religious [[Christian revival|revival]] in response to a perceived decline in religiosity.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Chapter 1, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 148\u2013152}} The Ulster Scots who immigrated to the American colonies in the 1700s brought with them their own revival tradition, specifically the practice of [[communion season]]s.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=31}} Pietism was a movement within the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches]] in Europe that emphasized a \"religion of the heart\": the ideal that faith was not simply acceptance of [[proposition]]al truth but was an emotional \"commitment of one's whole being to God\" in which one's life became dedicated to [[Self-denial|self-sacrificial]] ministry.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|pp=24\u201325}} Pietists promoted the formation of [[cell groups]] for [[Bible study (Christianity)|Bible study]], prayer and accountability.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=34}}\n\nThese three traditions were brought together with the [[First Great Awakening]], a series of revivals occurring in both Britain and its American Colonies during the 1730s and 1740s.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=27}} The Awakening began within the Congregational churches of New England. In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S. Kidd]], \"''seasons of revival'', or ''outpourings of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]'', and on ''converted sinners experiencing God's love personally''\" [emphasis in original].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=xiv}} Evangelicals believed in the \"[[new birth]]\"\u2014a discernible moment of conversion\u2014and that it was normal for a Christian to have [[assurance of faith]].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 66}} While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\".{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}} \n\nIts emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an [[egalitarian]] streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} The revivals influenced all the major Protestant denominations and turned most Protestants into evangelicals.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=25}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nKentucky was the location of the [[Revival of 1800]] led by Presbyterian minister [[James McGready]]. It was here that the traditional Scottish communion season began to evolve into the American [[camp meeting]].{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=58}} A year later, the [[Cane Ridge Revival]] led by [[Barton Stone]] lasted a week and drew crowds of 20,000 people from the thinly populated frontier. At Cane Ridge, many converts experienced religious ecstasy and \"bodily agitations\".{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}} Some worshipers caught [[holy laughter]], barked like dogs, experienced convulsions, fell into trances, danced, shouted or were [[slain in the Spirit]]. Similar things had occurred in other revivals, but they were more intense at Cane Ridge. This revival was the origin of the [[Stone-Campbell Movement]], from which the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Disciples of Christ]] denominations originate.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=72}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}}\n\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] was the most successful at gaining converts. It enthusiastically adopted camp meetings as a regular part of church life and devoted resources to evangelizing the western frontier. Itinerant ministers known as [[circuit riders]] traveled hundreds of miles each year to preach and serve scattered congregations. The Methodists took a democratic and egalitarian approach to ministry, allowing poor and uneducated young men to become circuit riders. The Baptists also expanded rapidly. Like the Methodists, Baptists also sent out itinerant ministers, often with little education.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n\nUnlike the First Great Awakening which was largely [[Calvinist]] in orientation, the Second Great Awakening was more theologically diverse with [[Arminians]] (whose theology allowed for some [[Free will in theology|free will]] in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]) playing important roles.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world. Many evangelicals urged that Christians must engage the culture directly and constructively,<ref>{{Citation|last=Henry|first=Carl FH|title=The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism|date=August 29, 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080282661X|origyear=1947|edition=reprint|place=Grand Rapids|publisher=Eerdmans|ISBN=0-8028-2661-X}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} and they began to express reservations about being known to the world as ''fundamentalists''.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\"). After Nazi Germany and fascist Japan had been destroyed, the newly mobilized evangelicals were now prepared to combat atheistic communism, secularism, Darwinism, liberalism, Catholicism, and (in overseas missions) paganism.{{Sfn|Miller-Davenport|2013}}{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[charismatic movement|Charismatic Movement]] began in the 1960s and resulted in [[Pentecostal]] theology and practice being introduced into many mainline denominations. New Charismatic groups such as the [[Association of Vineyard Churches]] and [[Newfrontiers]] trace their roots to this period (see also [[British New Church Movement]]).

Joplin is the largest city in Jasper County - even though it is not the [[county seat]], and it is the [[List of cities in Missouri|12th most-populous city]] in the state.

Joplin is the main hub of the three-county [[Joplin-Miami, MO-OK MSA|Joplin-Miami, Missouri-Oklahoma Metro area]], which is home to 210,077 people making it the 5th largest metropolitan area in Missouri.\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\n[[Image:Main Street, Looking South, Joplin, MO.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Main Street, below 5th Street, circa 1910]]\nLead was discovered in the Joplin Creek Valley before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but only after the war did significant development take place. By 1871, numerous mining camps sprang up in the valley and resident John C. Cox filed a plan for a city on the east side of the valley.<ref>Dolph Shaner, ''The Story of Joplin'' (New York City: Stratford House, 1948), 20.</ref> Cox named his village Joplin City after the spring and creek nearby, which had been named for the Reverend Harris G. Joplin, who settled upon its banks circa 1840.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ | title=How Missouri Counties, Towns and Streams Were Named | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | author=Eaton, David Wolfe | year=1916 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ/page/n76 179]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The historic period was referred to as the \"Reign of Terror\". The cities eventually merged into Union City, but when the merger was found illegal, the cities split. Murphy suggested that a combined city be named Joplin. The cities merged again on March 23, 1873, this time permanently, as the City of Joplin.<ref>Shaner, ''Joplin'', 31 \u2013 33.</ref>\n\nWhile Joplin was first settled for lead mining, zinc, often referred to as \"jack\", was the most important mineral resource. As railroads were built to connect Joplin to major markets in other cities, it was on the verge of dramatic growth. By the start of the twentieth century, the city was becoming a regional metropolis. Construction centered around Main Street, with many bars, hotels, and fine homes nearby. Joplin's three-story \"House of Lords\" was its most famous saloon, with a bar and restaurant on the first floor, gambling on the second, and a brothel on the third. [[Tram|Trolley]] and rail lines made Joplin the hub of southwest Missouri. As the center of the \"Tri-state district\", it soon became the lead- and zinc-mining capital of the world.\n\nAs a result of extensive [[surface mining|surface]] and [[Underground mining|deep mining]], Joplin is dotted with [[open-pit]] mines and [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s. Mining left many tailings piles (small hills of ground rock), which are considered unsightly locally. The open-pit mines pose hazards, but some find them to have a kind of beauty, as well. The main part of Joplin is nearly 75% undermined, with some mine shafts well over 100&nbsp;ft (30 m) deep. These mine shafts have occasionally caved in, creating [[sinkhole]]s. The mining history and geology are well documented in the mineral museum in town.\n\n===20th century===\n{{wide image|Joplin panorama.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Joplin, in 1910}}\nJoplin began to add cultural amenities; in 1902, residents passed a tax to create a public library, and gained matching funds that enabled them to build the [[Carnegie Library]]. It was seen as the symbol of a thriving city. In 1930, the grand commercial Electric Theater was built, one of the many movie palaces of the time. It was later purchased and renamed the Fox by [[Fox Theatres]] corporation. With the Depression and post-World War II suburban development, moviegoing declined at such large venues.\n[[image:Bonnieclyde f.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Bonnie and Clyde, photo developed by the ''Joplin Globe'' after the shootout]]\nIn 1933 during the [[Great Depression]], the notorious criminals [[Bonnie and Clyde]] spent some weeks in Joplin, where they robbed several area businesses. Tipped off by a neighbor, the [[Joplin Police Department]] attempted to apprehend the pair. Bonnie and Clyde escaped after killing Newton County Constable John Wesley Harryman and Joplin Police Detective Harry McGinnis; however, they were forced to leave most of their possessions behind, including a camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/bonnie/8.html |title=Court TV, CrimeLab website, page on Bonnie and Clyde |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222134253/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/bonnie/8.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}</ref> The ''[[Joplin Globe]]'' developed and printed the film, which showed now-legendary photos of Bonnie holding Clyde at mock gunpoint, and of Bonnie with her foot on a car fender, posed with a pistol in her hand and cigar in her mouth. The Missouri Advisory Council on Historic Preservation nominated the house where the couple stayed, at 34th Street and Oak Ridge Drive, for inclusion on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 13, 2009.\n\nAfter World War II, most of the mines were closed, and population growth leveled off. The main road through Joplin running east and west was designated as part of [[U.S. Route 66]], which became famous as more Americans took to newly constructed highways. The roads provided improved access between cities, but they also drew off population to newer housing and eventually retail centers.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, nearly 40 acres (16&nbsp;ha) of the city's downtown were razed in an attempt at [[urban renewal]], as population and businesses had moved to a suburban fringe along newly constructed highways. The Keystone Hotel and Worth Block (former home of the House of Lords) were notable historic structures that were demolished. [[Fifth and Main Historic District|Christman's Department Store]] stands (converted into loft apartments), as does the [[Joplin Union Depot]], since railroad restructuring and the decline in passenger traffic led to its closure. Other notable historic structures in Joplin include the Carnegie Library, [[Fred and Red's]] Diner, the Frisco Depot, the [[Scottish Rite|Scottish Rite Cathedral]], and the Crystal Cave (filled in and used for a parking lot). The Newman Mercantile Store has been adapted for use as City Hall. The Fox Theatre has been adapted for use as the Central Christian Center. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nOn May 5, 1971, Joplin was struck by a severe [[tornado]], resulting in one death and 50 injuries, along with major damage to many houses and businesses.<ref name=\"joplinpl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joplinpubliclibrary.org/digitized/joplin_tornado_booklet.php|title=Joplin Tornado|publisher=Joplin Public Library|accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>\n[[Image:Joplin Downtown Historic District.jpg|thumb|right|Historic district at 6th and Main, looking north, 2010]]\n\nOn November 11, 1978, Joplin's once-stately Connor Hotel, which was slated for implosion to make way for a new public library, collapsed suddenly and prematurely. Two demolition workers were killed instantly. A third, Alfred Sommers, was trapped for four days, yet survived.\n\n===21st century===\nThe city has two major hospitals which serve the Four States region, [[Freeman Health System]] and [[Mercy Hospital Joplin]], the latter replacing St. John's Regional Medical Center which was destroyed in the May 22, 2011, tornado. Freeman Hospital East and Landmark Hospital serve more specialized community health needs. The city's park system has nearly {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} and includes a golf course, three swimming pools, {{convert|15|mi|km}} of walking/biking trails, the world's largest remaining globally unique Chert Glades and Missouri's first Audubon Nature Center located in Wildcat Park. A waterfall, Grand Falls, the highest continuously flowing in the state, is on Shoal Creek on the southern end of the city. Included in Schifferdecker Park is the Everett J. Ritchie Tri-State Mineral Museum and Dorothea B. Hoover Historical Museum, which holds a significant collection of minerals from the era of lead and zinc mining in the region.\n\nNumerous buildings in Joplin have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their historic and architectural significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joplinindependent.com/display_article.php/mariwinn1136493341 |title=Historic Preservation Commission is revitalized |publisher=Joplin Independent |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The city has undertaken Agenda 21; a major project to revitalize its Main Street downtown district, which lies on the historic Route 66. It has refurbished building facades, sidewalks, and added old-styled lamp posts, flower baskets, and benches to highlight the historic center of the city.  A gasoline-powered citywide trolley system evokes images of the city's vibrant past.\n\nNumerous trucking lines such as CFI are headquartered in town, as the city is situated near the geographic and population centers of the nation. [[Eagle-Picher|Eagle-Picher Industries]], TAMKO Building Products, [[AT&T Communications]], and [[Schaeffler Group|FAG Bearings]] are noted employers in Joplin, and [[Leggett & Platt]] (a [[Fortune 500]]) is located in nearby Carthage. The city is served by the [[Joplin Regional Airport]] located north of town near [[Webb City, Missouri|Webb City]].\n\nSince the 2011 tornado, the city continued to expand eastward toward [[Interstate 44|I-44]]. Large-scale development occurred along [[Range Line Road]], particularly around [[Northpark Mall (Missouri)|Northpark Mall]]. Numerous suburbs adjacent to the city include [[Carl Junction, Missouri|Carl Junction]], [[Webb City, Missouri|Webb City]], [[Duenweg, Missouri|Duenweg]], [[Duquesne, Missouri|Duquesne]], [[Airport Drive, Missouri|Airport Drive]], [[Oronogo]], [[Carterville, Missouri|Carterville]], [[Redings Mill, Missouri|Redings Mill]], [[Shoal Creek Drive, Missouri|Shoal Creek Drive]], [[Leawood, Missouri|Leawood]], and [[Saginaw, Missouri|Saginaw]].\n\nDue to its location near two major highways and its few event and sports facilities, Joplin attracts travelers and is a destination for conferences and group events. Joplin offers nearly 500 hotel rooms, the majority located within a 1/4-mile area of Range Line Road and I-44. It has the {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} John Q. Hammons Convention and Trade Center, which serves as the primary event facility for conventions, associations, and large events.\n\nEach June, Joplin hosts the Boomtown Run, a half marathon, 5K, and children's run. The event attracts runners from across the country, and features USTA certified courses which start and end in the historic downtown area. Celebrity runners featured at the prerace banquet have included Bart Yasso, Sarah Reinerston, Suzy Favor-Hamilton, and Jeff Galloway. In 2011, due to the devastating EF5 tornado that struck Joplin on May 22, just three weeks before the run, the event was transformed in the Boomtown Run Day of Service. About 270 individuals registered for the race after the tornado struck, knowing their proceeds would benefit tornado recovery. On June 11, about 270 registered runners and volunteers turned out to help clean debris and sort donations, contributing more than 1,200 hours of service.

These popups also showcased the beginning of an arts renaissance in Joplin which still can be seen throughout the city today. One of many monuments which popped up was the Rainbow Tree which can be found on 20th Street between Indiana Avenue and Illinois Avenue.

After the tornado butterflies became a major part of the artistic works in the city due to the stories of children seeing butterfly entities carrying people through the sky shortly after the tornado which spread across the community of Joplin. One of the first works in Joplin to incorporate Butterflies was the \"Butterfly Effect: Dreams Take Flight\" Mural which is located on the Northwest corner of 15th and Main Street.

In the overview the City states its strategic priorities for tourism which were improve the visitor experience, increase the number of visitors, capture visitor spending, and emphasize results-driven tourism marketing. The purpose of the study was to provide direction for Joplin to help define the focus for future tourism efforts. In the study the city mentions the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the tourism market in the region as well as recommendations to increase tourism in the city. One of the recommendations in the study was to develop a conference center with an incorporated or adjacent hotel which could accommodate groups up to 2,500 and include multi-use exhibit space, breakout rooms and the newest technology. Another recommendation was to enhance downtown by encouraging hotel development in downtown, supporting and promoting development of empire market and food culture, supporting development of an Arts & Entertainment complex, supporting efforts of Connect2Culture and the broader art community relating facilities and programs downtown, hosting a variety of special events downtown, promoting downtown as a location for dining, shopping and culture, and continuing Main Street and downtown core improvements. It is recommended that the first step for the CVB Board is to discuss and decide which of the recommendations they see as priorities and take these to City Council for their recommendation. Additionally, the CVB should start collecting visitor data, undertake Identity and Branding study (with the City as lead or in partnership with the City), work on increasing lodging tax, ear-marked for conference center use the Tourism Study as a roadmap for future decision-making.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joplinmo.org/DocumentCenter/View/7405/Joplin-Independent-Tourism-Study-Final-Report-3-15-2018|title=Joplin-Independent-Tourism-Study-Final-Report-3-15-2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn September, 2019 Joplin unveiled the Rotary Sculpture Garden in Mercy Park which is home to 9 new sculptures with more on the way.

The historic period was referred to as the \"Reign of Terror\". The cities eventually merged into Union City, but when the merger was found illegal, the cities split. Murphy suggested that a combined city be named Joplin. The cities merged again on March 23, 1873, this time permanently, as the City of Joplin.<ref>Shaner, ''Joplin'', 31 \u2013 33.</ref>\n\nWhile Joplin was first settled for lead mining, zinc, often referred to as \"jack\", was the most important mineral resource. As railroads were built to connect Joplin to major markets in other cities, it was on the verge of dramatic growth. By the start of the twentieth century, the city was becoming a regional metropolis. Construction centered around Main Street, with many bars, hotels, and fine homes nearby. Joplin's three-story \"House of Lords\" was its most famous saloon, with a bar and restaurant on the first floor, gambling on the second, and a brothel on the third. [[Tram|Trolley]] and rail lines made Joplin the hub of southwest Missouri. As the center of the \"Tri-state district\", it soon became the lead- and zinc-mining capital of the world.\n\nAs a result of extensive [[surface mining|surface]] and [[Underground mining|deep mining]], Joplin is dotted with [[open-pit]] mines and [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s. Mining left many tailings piles (small hills of ground rock), which are considered unsightly locally. The open-pit mines pose hazards, but some find them to have a kind of beauty, as well. The main part of Joplin is nearly 75% undermined, with some mine shafts well over 100&nbsp;ft (30 m) deep. These mine shafts have occasionally caved in, creating [[sinkhole]]s. The mining history and geology are well documented in the mineral museum in town.\n\n===20th century===\n{{wide image|Joplin panorama.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Joplin, in 1910}}\nJoplin began to add cultural amenities; in 1902, residents passed a tax to create a public library, and gained matching funds that enabled them to build the [[Carnegie Library]]. It was seen as the symbol of a thriving city. In 1930, the grand commercial Electric Theater was built, one of the many movie palaces of the time. It was later purchased and renamed the Fox by [[Fox Theatres]] corporation. With the Depression and post-World War II suburban development, moviegoing declined at such large venues.\n[[image:Bonnieclyde f.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Bonnie and Clyde, photo developed by the ''Joplin Globe'' after the shootout]]\nIn 1933 during the [[Great Depression]], the notorious criminals [[Bonnie and Clyde]] spent some weeks in Joplin, where they robbed several area businesses. Tipped off by a neighbor, the [[Joplin Police Department]] attempted to apprehend the pair. Bonnie and Clyde escaped after killing Newton County Constable John Wesley Harryman and Joplin Police Detective Harry McGinnis; however, they were forced to leave most of their possessions behind, including a camera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/bonnie/8.html |title=Court TV, CrimeLab website, page on Bonnie and Clyde |publisher=Crimelibrary.com |accessdate=May 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222134253/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/bonnie/8.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}</ref> The ''[[Joplin Globe]]'' developed and printed the film, which showed now-legendary photos of Bonnie holding Clyde at mock gunpoint, and of Bonnie with her foot on a car fender, posed with a pistol in her hand and cigar in her mouth. The Missouri Advisory Council on Historic Preservation nominated the house where the couple stayed, at 34th Street and Oak Ridge Drive, for inclusion on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on February 13, 2009.\n\nAfter World War II, most of the mines were closed, and population growth leveled off. The main road through Joplin running east and west was designated as part of [[U.S. Route 66]], which became famous as more Americans took to newly constructed highways. The roads provided improved access between cities, but they also drew off population to newer housing and eventually retail centers.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, nearly 40 acres (16&nbsp;ha) of the city's downtown were razed in an attempt at [[urban renewal]], as population and businesses had moved to a suburban fringe along newly constructed highways. The Keystone Hotel and Worth Block (former home of the House of Lords) were notable historic structures that were demolished. [[Fifth and Main Historic District|Christman's Department Store]] stands (converted into loft apartments), as does the [[Joplin Union Depot]], since railroad restructuring and the decline in passenger traffic led to its closure. Other notable historic structures in Joplin include the Carnegie Library, [[Fred and Red's]] Diner, the Frisco Depot, the [[Scottish Rite|Scottish Rite Cathedral]], and the Crystal Cave (filled in and used for a parking lot). The Newman Mercantile Store has been adapted for use as City Hall. The Fox Theatre has been adapted for use as the Central Christian Center. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nOn May 5, 1971, Joplin was struck by a severe [[tornado]], resulting in one death and 50 injuries, along with major damage to many houses and businesses.<ref name=\"joplinpl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joplinpubliclibrary.org/digitized/joplin_tornado_booklet.php|title=Joplin Tornado|publisher=Joplin Public Library|accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>\n[[Image:Joplin Downtown Historic District.jpg|thumb|right|Historic district at 6th and Main, looking north, 2010]]\n\nOn November 11, 1978, Joplin's once-stately Connor Hotel, which was slated for implosion to make way for a new public library, collapsed suddenly and prematurely. Two demolition workers were killed instantly. A third, Alfred Sommers, was trapped for four days, yet survived.\n\n===21st century===\nThe city has two major hospitals which serve the Four States region, [[Freeman Health System]] and [[Mercy Hospital Joplin]], the latter replacing St. John's Regional Medical Center which was destroyed in the May 22, 2011, tornado. Freeman Hospital East and Landmark Hospital serve more specialized community health needs. The city's park system has nearly {{convert|1000|acre|ha}} and includes a golf course, three swimming pools, {{convert|15|mi|km}} of walking/biking trails, the world's largest remaining globally unique Chert Glades and Missouri's first Audubon Nature Center located in Wildcat Park. A waterfall, Grand Falls, the highest continuously flowing in the state, is on Shoal Creek on the southern end of the city. Included in Schifferdecker Park is the Everett J. Ritchie Tri-State Mineral Museum and Dorothea B. Hoover Historical Museum, which holds a significant collection of minerals from the era of lead and zinc mining in the region.\n\nNumerous buildings in Joplin have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for their historic and architectural significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joplinindependent.com/display_article.php/mariwinn1136493341 |title=Historic Preservation Commission is revitalized |publisher=Joplin Independent |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The city has undertaken Agenda 21; a major project to revitalize its Main Street downtown district, which lies on the historic Route 66. It has refurbished building facades, sidewalks, and added old-styled lamp posts, flower baskets, and benches to highlight the historic center of the city.  A gasoline-powered citywide trolley system evokes images of the city's vibrant past.\n\nNumerous trucking lines such as CFI are headquartered in town, as the city is situated near the geographic and population centers of the nation. [[Eagle-Picher|Eagle-Picher Industries]], TAMKO Building Products, [[AT&T Communications]], and [[Schaeffler Group|FAG Bearings]] are noted employers in Joplin, and [[Leggett & Platt]] (a [[Fortune 500]]) is located in nearby Carthage. The city is served by the [[Joplin Regional Airport]] located north of town near [[Webb City, Missouri|Webb City]].\n\nSince the 2011 tornado, the city continued to expand eastward toward [[Interstate 44|I-44]]. Large-scale development occurred along [[Range Line Road]], particularly around [[Northpark Mall (Missouri)|Northpark Mall]]. Numerous suburbs adjacent to the city include [[Carl Junction, Missouri|Carl Junction]], [[Webb City, Missouri|Webb City]], [[Duenweg, Missouri|Duenweg]], [[Duquesne, Missouri|Duquesne]], [[Airport Drive, Missouri|Airport Drive]], [[Oronogo]], [[Carterville, Missouri|Carterville]], [[Redings Mill, Missouri|Redings Mill]], [[Shoal Creek Drive, Missouri|Shoal Creek Drive]], [[Leawood, Missouri|Leawood]], and [[Saginaw, Missouri|Saginaw]].\n\nDue to its location near two major highways and its few event and sports facilities, Joplin attracts travelers and is a destination for conferences and group events. Joplin offers nearly 500 hotel rooms, the majority located within a 1/4-mile area of Range Line Road and I-44. It has the {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} John Q. Hammons Convention and Trade Center, which serves as the primary event facility for conventions, associations, and large events.\n\nEach June, Joplin hosts the Boomtown Run, a half marathon, 5K, and children's run. The event attracts runners from across the country, and features USTA certified courses which start and end in the historic downtown area. Celebrity runners featured at the prerace banquet have included Bart Yasso, Sarah Reinerston, Suzy Favor-Hamilton, and Jeff Galloway. In 2011, due to the devastating EF5 tornado that struck Joplin on May 22, just three weeks before the run, the event was transformed in the Boomtown Run Day of Service. About 270 individuals registered for the race after the tornado struck, knowing their proceeds would benefit tornado recovery. On June 11, about 270 registered runners and volunteers turned out to help clean debris and sort donations, contributing more than 1,200 hours of service. On August 7, 2012, the Village of Silver Creek and the City of Joplin voted to have Silver Creek annexed into Joplin City limits.<ref>{{cite web | title = Boundary Changes | url = http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/partnerships/bas/2010-2015entitychanges.txt | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170818212400/https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/partnerships/bas/2010-2015entitychanges.txt | archivedate = 2017-08-18 }}</ref>\n\n====2011 tornado====\n[[File:Joplin 2011 tornado damage.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of tornado damage]]\n[[File:Obama-joplin-missouri1.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] greets an 85-year-old tornado survivor in front of his house on May 29, 2011.]]\n{{See also|2011 Joplin tornado}}\nOn May 22, 2011, an EF5 [[tornado]] touched down near the western edge of the city among large, newer homes, about 5:21&nbsp;pm CDT (22:34 UTC) and tracked eastward across the city and across Interstate 44 into rural portions of [[Newton County, Missouri|Newton]] County.

These popups also showcased the beginning of an arts renaissance in Joplin which still can be seen throughout the city today. One of many monuments which popped up was the Rainbow Tree which can be found on 20th Street between Indiana Avenue and Illinois Avenue.

One of the first works in Joplin to incorporate Butterflies was the \"Butterfly Effect: Dreams Take Flight\" Mural which is located on the Northwest corner of 15th and Main Street.

In the overview the City states its strategic priorities for tourism which were improve the visitor experience, increase the number of visitors, capture visitor spending, and emphasize results-driven tourism marketing. The purpose of the study was to provide direction for Joplin to help define the focus for future tourism efforts. In the study the city mentions the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the tourism market in the region as well as recommendations to increase tourism in the city. One of the recommendations in the study was to develop a conference center with an incorporated or adjacent hotel which could accommodate groups up to 2,500 and include multi-use exhibit space, breakout rooms and the newest technology. Another recommendation was to enhance downtown by encouraging hotel development in downtown, supporting and promoting development of empire market and food culture, supporting development of an Arts & Entertainment complex, supporting efforts of Connect2Culture and the broader art community relating facilities and programs downtown, hosting a variety of special events downtown, promoting downtown as a location for dining, shopping and culture, and continuing Main Street and downtown core improvements. It is recommended that the first step for the CVB Board is to discuss and decide which of the recommendations they see as priorities and take these to City Council for their recommendation. Additionally, the CVB should start collecting visitor data, undertake Identity and Branding study (with the City as lead or in partnership with the City), work on increasing lodging tax, ear-marked for conference center use the Tourism Study as a roadmap for future decision-making.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joplinmo.org/DocumentCenter/View/7405/Joplin-Independent-Tourism-Study-Final-Report-3-15-2018|title=Joplin-Independent-Tourism-Study-Final-Report-3-15-2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn September, 2019 Joplin unveiled the Rotary Sculpture Garden in Mercy Park which is home to 9 new sculptures with more on the way.
