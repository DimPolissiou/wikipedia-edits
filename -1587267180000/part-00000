See \"Wikipedia:How to write a plot summary\" (WP:PLOTSUM) for general guidelines. -->\nGrowing up in [[Texas]], Chris Kyle is taught by his father how to shoot a rifle and hunt deer. Years later, Kyle has become a ranch hand and [[rodeo]] cowboy, and returns home early, to find his girlfriend in bed with another man. After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he sees news coverage of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] and decides to enlist in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] sniper.\n\nKyle meets Taya Studebaker at a bar, and the two soon marry. He is sent to [[Iraq War|Iraq]] after the [[September 11 attacks]]. His first kills are a woman and boy who attacked [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with a Russian made [[RKG-3 anti-tank grenade]]. Kyle is visibly upset by the experience but later earns the nickname \"Legend\" for his many kills. Assigned to hunt for the [[al-Qaeda]] leader, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], Kyle interrogates a family whose father offers to lead the SEALs to \"The Butcher\", al-Zarqawi's second-in-command. The plan goes awry when The Butcher captures the father and his son, killing them while Kyle is pinned down by a sniper. This sniper goes by the name Mustafa and is an [[Olympic Games]] medalist from [[Syria]]. Meanwhile, the insurgents issue a bounty on Kyle.\n\nKyle returns home to his wife and the birth of his son. He is distracted by memories of his war experiences and by Taya's concern for them as a couple \u2013 she wishes he would focus on his home and family.\n\nKyle leaves for a second tour and is promoted to [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]]. Involved in a shootout with The Butcher, he helps in killing him. When he returns home to a newborn daughter, Kyle becomes increasingly distant from his family. On Kyle's third tour, Mustafa seriously injures a unit member, Ryan \"Biggles\" Job, and the unit is evacuated back to base. When they decide to return to the field and continue the mission, another SEAL, [[Marc Alan Lee|Marc Lee]], is killed by gunfire.\n\nGuilt compels Kyle to undertake a fourth tour, and Taya tells him that she may not be there when he returns. Back in Iraq, Kyle is shocked to learn that Biggles died in surgery to repair the wounds he sustained. Assigned to kill Mustafa, who has been sniping U.S. Army combat engineers building a barricade. Kyle's sniper team is placed on a rooftop inside enemy territory. Kyle spots Mustafa and takes him out with a risky long distance shot at {{convert|2,100|yd|m|0}}, but this exposes his team's position to numerous armed insurgents. In the midst of the gunfight, and low on ammunition, Kyle tearfully calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home. A sandstorm provides cover for a chaotic escape in which Kyle is injured and almost left behind.\n\nAfter Kyle gets back, on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian life, he is asked by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] psychiatrist if he is haunted by all the things he did in war. When he replies that it is \"all the guys [he] couldn't save\" that haunt him, the psychiatrist encourages him to help severely wounded veterans in the VA hospital. After that, Kyle gradually begins to adjust to home life.\n\nYears later, on February 2, 2013, Kyle says goodbye to his wife and family as he leaves in good spirits to spend time with a veteran at a shooting range. An on-screen subtitle reveals: \"Chris Kyle was killed that day by a [[Murders of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield#Perpetrator|veteran he was trying to help]]\", followed by archive footage of crowds standing along the highway for his funeral procession. More are shown attending his memorial service.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Chris Kyle]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bradley-cooper-navy-seal-american-sniper-warner-bros-303006|title=Bradley Cooper Sets Up Navy SEAL Pic 'American Sniper' at Warner Bros.

Years later, Kyle has become a ranch hand and [[rodeo]] cowboy, and returns home early, to find his girlfriend in bed with another man. After telling her to leave, he is mulling it over with his brother when he sees news coverage of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] and decides to enlist in the Navy. He qualifies for special training and becomes a [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]] sniper.\n\nKyle meets Taya Studebaker at a bar, and the two soon marry. He is sent to [[Iraq War|Iraq]] after the [[September 11 attacks]]. His first kills are a woman and boy who attacked [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with a Russian made [[RKG-3 anti-tank grenade]]. Kyle is visibly upset by the experience but later earns the nickname \"Legend\" for his many kills. Assigned to hunt for the [[al-Qaeda]] leader, [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], Kyle interrogates a family whose father offers to lead the SEALs to \"The Butcher\", al-Zarqawi's second-in-command. The plan goes awry when The Butcher captures the father and his son, killing them while Kyle is pinned down by a sniper. This sniper goes by the name Mustafa and is an [[Olympic Games]] medalist from [[Syria]]. Meanwhile, the insurgents issue a bounty on Kyle.\n\nKyle returns home to his wife and the birth of his son. He is distracted by memories of his war experiences and by Taya's concern for them as a couple \u2013 she wishes he would focus on his home and family.\n\nKyle leaves for a second tour and is promoted to [[Chief petty officer|Chief Petty Officer]]. Involved in a shootout with The Butcher, he helps in killing him. When he returns home to a newborn daughter, Kyle becomes increasingly distant from his family. On Kyle's third tour, Mustafa seriously injures a unit member, Ryan \"Biggles\" Job, and the unit is evacuated back to base. When they decide to return to the field and continue the mission, another SEAL, [[Marc Alan Lee|Marc Lee]], is killed by gunfire.\n\nGuilt compels Kyle to undertake a fourth tour, and Taya tells him that she may not be there when he returns. Back in Iraq, Kyle is shocked to learn that Biggles died in surgery to repair the wounds he sustained. Assigned to kill Mustafa, who has been sniping U.S. Army combat engineers building a barricade. Kyle's sniper team is placed on a rooftop inside enemy territory. Kyle spots Mustafa and takes him out with a risky long distance shot at {{convert|2,100|yd|m|0}}, but this exposes his team's position to numerous armed insurgents. In the midst of the gunfight, and low on ammunition, Kyle tearfully calls Taya and tells her he is ready to come home. A sandstorm provides cover for a chaotic escape in which Kyle is injured and almost left behind.\n\nAfter Kyle gets back, on edge and unable to adjust fully to civilian life, he is asked by a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] psychiatrist if he is haunted by all the things he did in war. When he replies that it is \"all the guys [he] couldn't save\" that haunt him, the psychiatrist encourages him to help severely wounded veterans in the VA hospital. After that, Kyle gradually begins to adjust to home life.\n\nYears later, on February 2, 2013, Kyle says goodbye to his wife and family as he leaves in good spirits to spend time with a veteran at a shooting range. An on-screen subtitle reveals: \"Chris Kyle was killed that day by a [[Murders of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield#Perpetrator|veteran he was trying to help]]\", followed by archive footage of crowds standing along the highway for his funeral procession. More are shown attending his memorial service.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Chris Kyle]]<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bradley-cooper-navy-seal-american-sniper-warner-bros-303006|title=Bradley Cooper Sets Up Navy SEAL Pic 'American Sniper' at Warner Bros.
