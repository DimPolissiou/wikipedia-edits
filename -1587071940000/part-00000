The historic '''Archdiocese of Salerno''' was in existence from the tenth century, having been elevated from a sixth-century diocese. The [[Diocese of Acerno]] was combined with the archdiocese in 1818.<ref name=CathHierSalerno>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dscai.html \"Archdiocese of Salerno-Campagna-Acerno\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]].''

The architecture of DNMT3 enzymes is similar to that of DNMT1, with a regulatory region attached to a catalytic domain. There are three known members of the DNMT3 family: DNMT3a, 3b, and 3L.\n\nDNMT3a and DNMT3b can mediate methylation-independent gene repression. DNMT3a can co-localize with [[heterochromatin]] protein (HP1) and methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCBP). They can also interact with DNMT1, which might be a co-operative event during DNA methylation. DNMT3a prefers [[CpG site|CpG]] [[methylation]] to CpA, CpT, and CpC methylation, though there appears to be some sequence preference of methylation for DNMT3a and DNMT3b. DNMT3a methylates [[CpG site|CpG]] sites at a rate much slower than DNMT1, but greater than DNMT3b.\n\nDNMT3L contains DNA methyltransferase [[Sequence motif|motif]]s and is required for establishing maternal [[genomic imprinting|genomic imprints]], despite being [[catalytic]]ally inactive. DNMT3L is expressed during [[gametogenesis]] when [[genomic imprinting]] takes place. The loss of DNMT3L leads to bi-[[allele|allelic]] expression of genes normally not expressed by the maternal allele. DNMT3L interacts with DNMT3a and DNMT3b and co-localized in the nucleus. Though DNMT3L appears incapable of [[methylation]], it may participate in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al repression.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n===DNMT inhibitors===\nBecause of the [[Epigenetics#Epigenetic effects in humans|epigenetic effect]]s of the DNMT family, some [[DNMT inhibitor]]s are under investigation for treatment of some cancers:<ref name=\"pmid21139608\">{{cite journal | author = Mack GS | title = To selectivity and beyond | journal = Nat.

The architecture of DNMT3 enzymes is similar to that of DNMT1, with a regulatory region attached to a catalytic domain. There are three known members of the DNMT3 family: DNMT3a, 3b, and 3L.\n\nDNMT3a and DNMT3b can mediate methylation-independent gene repression. DNMT3a can co-localize with [[heterochromatin]] protein (HP1) and methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCBP). They can also interact with DNMT1, which might be a co-operative event during DNA methylation. DNMT3a prefers [[CpG site|CpG]] [[methylation]] to CpA, CpT, and CpC methylation, though there appears to be some sequence preference of methylation for DNMT3a and DNMT3b. DNMT3a methylates [[CpG site|CpG]] sites at a rate much slower than DNMT1, but greater than DNMT3b.\n\nDNMT3L contains DNA methyltransferase [[Sequence motif|motif]]s and is required for establishing maternal [[genomic imprinting|genomic imprints]], despite being [[catalytic]]ally inactive. DNMT3L is expressed during [[gametogenesis]] when [[genomic imprinting]] takes place. The loss of DNMT3L leads to bi-[[allele|allelic]] expression of genes normally not expressed by the maternal allele. DNMT3L interacts with DNMT3a and DNMT3b and co-localized in the nucleus. Though DNMT3L appears incapable of [[methylation]], it may participate in [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al repression.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n===DNMT inhibitors===\nBecause of the [[Epigenetics#Epigenetic effects in humans|epigenetic effect]]s of the DNMT family, some [[DNMT inhibitor]]s are under investigation for treatment of some cancers:<ref name=\"pmid21139608\">{{cite journal | author = Mack GS | title = To selectivity and beyond | journal = Nat.

It covers the [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|City and County of Philadelphia]] as well as [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] counties. The diocese was erected by [[Pope Pius VII]] on April 8, 1808, from territories of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]]. Originally the diocese included all of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and seven counties and parts of three counties in [[West Jersey|New Jersey]]. The diocese was raised to the dignity of a [[metropolitan archdiocese]] on February 12, 1875. The seat of the [[archbishop]] is the [[Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul|Cathedral-Basilica of Ss. Peter & Paul]].\n\nIt is also the [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Episcopal See|See]] of the [[ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Ecclesiastical Province]] of Philadelphia, which includes the [[Suffragan diocese|suffragan]] [[episcopal see]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown|Allentown]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown|Altoona-Johnstown]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie|Erie]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg|Greensburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg|Harrisburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton|Scranton]]. The territory of the province is coextensive with the state of Pennsylvania.\n\n==History of the archdiocese==\n\nThe history of the Catholic Church in the area dates back to [[William Penn]] and when [[Mass (liturgy)#Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] was said publicly as early as 1707.<ref name=PhilaHist>[http://archphila.org/history.htm ''A Brief History of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802145518/http://archphila.org/history.htm |date=2009-08-02 }}.

Two grand jury reports, guilty pleas and convictions indicate administrative mishandling of cases and other issues.\n{{further|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia}}\n\nThe [[sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]], in Pennsylvania, U.S., is a significant episode in the series of Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States, Ireland and elsewhere. The Philadelphia abuses were substantially revealed through a grand jury investigation in 2005. In early 2011, a new grand jury reported extensive new charges of abusive priests active in the archdiocese. In 2012, a guilty plea by priest Edward Avery and the related trial and conviction of Monsignor William Lynn and mistrial on charges against Rev. James J. Brennan followed from the grand jury's investigations. In 2013, Rev. Charles Engelhardt and teacher Bernard Shero were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Lynn was the first official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge and other senior church officials have been extensively criticized for their management of the issue in the archdiocese.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, a new trial date was official set for Lynn, who was released and ordered to be retried in 2016 after serving 33 months of his sentence, with jury selection to start March 16.<ref>https://whyy.org/articles/msgr-lynn-on-trial-again-for-covering-up-clergy-sexual-abuse/</ref> However, the [[2019-20 coronavirus|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]] forced Lynn's retrial to be delayed until January 2021.<ref name=lynndelayed>https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/retrial-of-ex-philly-catholic-official-delayed-over-coronavirus-concerns/2328110/</ref><ref name=lynnstilldelayed>https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-16/monsignor-in-landmark-church-abuse-case-goes-back-on-trial</ref> Following his release from prison in 2016, Lynn was ordered to remain on supervised parole until his retrial<ref name=aug2016>http://catholicphilly.com/2016/08/news/local-news/msgr-lynn-is-freed-from-prison-retrial-set-for-next-year/</ref>\n\n===Firing of Margie Winters for same-sex marriage===\n\nIn 2015, it was reported that the school's director of religious education, Margie Winters, had been fired from the [[Waldron Mercy Academy]] after a parent had reported her directly to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for marrying her long-term lesbian partner in a civil ceremony in 2007. Winters had been upfront with school administrators at the time of her hiring and was advised to keep a low profile which she says she did. Many parents expressed anger and concern over the school's decision. Principal Nell Stetser justified the decision by arguing that \"many of us accept life choices that contradict current Church teachings, but to continue as a Catholic school, Waldron Mercy must comply with those teachings.\" But she called for \"an open and honest discussion about this and other divisive issues at the intersection of our society and our Church.\" The Archbishop of Philadelphia, [[Charles Chaput]], called the dismissal \"common sense.\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warren-hall-pope-francis_55ad6324e4b0caf721b39e2c|title=Gay Priest Fired From Chaplain Job Asks Pope To Meet LGBT Catholics In U.S|date=July 20, 2015|work=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/archives/|title=Archives {{!}} The Philadelphia Inquirer|website=https://www.inquirer.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> On January 23, 2020, Pope Francis accepted Chaput's letter of resignation and appointed Cleveland Bishop [[Nelson Perez]] to succeed Chaput as Archbishop of Philadelphia on February 18, 2020.<ref name=chaputperez>https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/nelson-perez-philadelphia-archbishop-charles-chaput-1.40925682</ref> After his installation on February 18, 2020, Nelson Perez became the first Hispanic Archbishop of Philadelphia<ref name=chaputperez />\n\n==Bishops==\n[[Image:Charles Joseph Chaput.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Charles Joseph Chaput, O.F.M.

During the nineteenth century, Bishop Kenrick encouraged the establishment of Catholic schools. Subsequently, St. John Neumann (1851\u20131860) made the establishment of parish elementary schools a priority and by 1860 there were seventeen parish elementary schools in Philadelphia.  Between 1900 and 1930, Catholic elementary schools increased to 124 schools in Philadelphia and 78 schools in the four suburban counties. Between 1945 and 1965, 62 new Catholic elementary schools were established.\n\nIn 2012, about 25%<!--\"[...]who are a quarter[...]\"--> of the students in Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools were not Catholic.<ref name=Tierneymiracle/> In 2010 [[South Philadelphia]] Catholic elementary schools had 2,572 students, a decline by 27% from the 2006 figure.<ref name=CampisisouthphillyCathschool/>\n\n===Special Needs schools===\nWith the foundation of Archbishop Ryan School for Children with Deafness in 1912, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia school system began serving families of children with special needs.  St. Katherine Day School and Our Lady of Confidence School, serving students with mental retardation, were opened in 1953 and 1954 respectively, after parent petitions to John Cardinal O'Hara. St. Lucy Day School for Children with Visual Impairment followed in 1955. Queen of the Universe Day Center was added in 1980 to serve students with mental retardation in Bucks County. These five schools are supported by the Catholic Charities Appeal.\n\n===High schools within the archdiocese===\n{{see also|Category:Roman Catholic secondary schools in Philadelphia}}\n\n====Diocesan high schools====\nLeadership within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia envisioned a continued comprehensive education for secondary students.\n\nThe first free Catholic high school in the United States was the [[Roman Catholic High School|\"Roman Catholic High School of Philadelphia\"]], founded for the education of boys in 1890. (It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W.

It covers the [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|City and County of Philadelphia]] as well as [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] counties. The diocese was erected by [[Pope Pius VII]] on April 8, 1808, from territories of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]]. Originally the diocese included all of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and seven counties and parts of three counties in [[West Jersey|New Jersey]]. The diocese was raised to the dignity of a [[metropolitan archdiocese]] on February 12, 1875. The seat of the [[archbishop]] is the [[Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul|Cathedral-Basilica of Ss. Peter & Paul]].\n\nIt is also the [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Episcopal See|See]] of the [[ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Ecclesiastical Province]] of Philadelphia, which includes the [[Suffragan diocese|suffragan]] [[episcopal see]]s of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Allentown|Allentown]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown|Altoona-Johnstown]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie|Erie]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg|Greensburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg|Harrisburg]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton|Scranton]].

Two grand jury reports, guilty pleas and convictions indicate administrative mishandling of cases and other issues.\n{{further|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia}}\n\nThe [[sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]], in Pennsylvania, U.S., is a significant episode in the series of Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States, Ireland and elsewhere. The Philadelphia abuses were substantially revealed through a grand jury investigation in 2005. In early 2011, a new grand jury reported extensive new charges of abusive priests active in the archdiocese. In 2012, a guilty plea by priest Edward Avery and the related trial and conviction of Monsignor William Lynn and mistrial on charges against Rev. James J. Brennan followed from the grand jury's investigations. In 2013, Rev. Charles Engelhardt and teacher Bernard Shero were tried, convicted and sentenced to prison. Lynn was the first official to be convicted in the United States of covering up abuses by other priests in his charge and other senior church officials have been extensively criticized for their management of the issue in the archdiocese.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, a new trial date was official set for Lynn, who was released and ordered to be retried in 2016 after serving 33 months of his sentence, with jury selection to start March 16.<ref>https://whyy.org/articles/msgr-lynn-on-trial-again-for-covering-up-clergy-sexual-abuse/</ref> However, the [[2019-20 coronavirus|ongoing coronavirus pandemic]] forced Lynn's retrial to be delayed until January 2021.<ref name=lynndelayed>https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/retrial-of-ex-philly-catholic-official-delayed-over-coronavirus-concerns/2328110/</ref><ref name=lynnstilldelayed>https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2020-03-16/monsignor-in-landmark-church-abuse-case-goes-back-on-trial</ref> Following his release from prison in 2016, Lynn was ordered to remain on supervised parole until his retrial<ref name=aug2016>http://catholicphilly.com/2016/08/news/local-news/msgr-lynn-is-freed-from-prison-retrial-set-for-next-year/</ref>\n\n===Firing of Margie Winters for same-sex marriage===\n\nIn 2015, it was reported that the school's director of religious education, Margie Winters, had been fired from the [[Waldron Mercy Academy]] after a parent had reported her directly to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for marrying her long-term lesbian partner in a civil ceremony in 2007. Winters had been upfront with school administrators at the time of her hiring and was advised to keep a low profile which she says she did. Many parents expressed anger and concern over the school's decision. Principal Nell Stetser justified the decision by arguing that \"many of us accept life choices that contradict current Church teachings, but to continue as a Catholic school, Waldron Mercy must comply with those teachings.\" But she called for \"an open and honest discussion about this and other divisive issues at the intersection of our society and our Church.\" The Archbishop of Philadelphia, [[Charles Chaput]], called the dismissal \"common sense.\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warren-hall-pope-francis_55ad6324e4b0caf721b39e2c|title=Gay Priest Fired From Chaplain Job Asks Pope To Meet LGBT Catholics In U.S|date=July 20, 2015|work=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/archives/|title=Archives {{!}} The Philadelphia Inquirer|website=https://www.inquirer.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> On January 23, 2020, Pope Francis accepted Chaput's letter of resignation and appointed Cleveland Bishop [[Nelson Perez]] to succeed Chaput as Archbishop of Philadelphia on February 18, 2020.<ref name=chaputperez>https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/nelson-perez-philadelphia-archbishop-charles-chaput-1.40925682</ref> After his installation on February 18, 2020, Nelson Perez became the first Hispanic Archbishop of Philadelphia<ref name=chaputperez />\n\n==Bishops==\n[[Image:Charles Joseph Chaput.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Charles Joseph Chaput, O.F.M.

During the nineteenth century, Bishop Kenrick encouraged the establishment of Catholic schools. Subsequently, St. John Neumann (1851\u20131860) made the establishment of parish elementary schools a priority and by 1860 there were seventeen parish elementary schools in Philadelphia.  Between 1900 and 1930, Catholic elementary schools increased to 124 schools in Philadelphia and 78 schools in the four suburban counties. Between 1945 and 1965, 62 new Catholic elementary schools were established.\n\nIn 2012, about 25%<!--\"[...]who are a quarter[...]\"--> of the students in Philadelphia Catholic elementary schools were not Catholic.<ref name=Tierneymiracle/> In 2010 [[South Philadelphia]] Catholic elementary schools had 2,572 students, a decline by 27% from the 2006 figure.<ref name=CampisisouthphillyCathschool/>\n\n===Special Needs schools===\nWith the foundation of Archbishop Ryan School for Children with Deafness in 1912, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia school system began serving families of children with special needs.  St. Katherine Day School and Our Lady of Confidence School, serving students with mental retardation, were opened in 1953 and 1954 respectively, after parent petitions to John Cardinal O'Hara. St. Lucy Day School for Children with Visual Impairment followed in 1955. Queen of the Universe Day Center was added in 1980 to serve students with mental retardation in Bucks County. These five schools are supported by the Catholic Charities Appeal.\n\n===High schools within the archdiocese===\n{{see also|Category:Roman Catholic secondary schools in Philadelphia}}\n\n====Diocesan high schools====\nLeadership within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia envisioned a continued comprehensive education for secondary students.\n\nThe first free Catholic high school in the United States was the [[Roman Catholic High School|\"Roman Catholic High School of Philadelphia\"]], founded for the education of boys in 1890. (It is often referred to as \"Roman Catholic\", occasionally as \"Catholic High\", and most commonly as \"Roman\".) The \"Catholic Girls High School\" was founded in 1912. Mary McMichan, one of the school's founders, requested in her last will that the school be renamed in honor of her brother.  The school became \"John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls High School\" after her death. Both schools are still in existence.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1927 West Catholic Boys and Girls and Northeast Catholic were opened. Despite the economic hardships of the 1930s and 1940s, seven more diocesan high schools were founded. During a 22-year growth period from 1945 to 1967, fifteen high schools were opened.\n\n===Seminaries===\n*[[St. Charles Borromeo Seminary]]\n*[[Redemptoris_Mater_(seminary)|Redemptois Mater Archdiocesan Missionary Seminary]]\n\n===Colleges and universities within the archdiocese===\n:''Note: Each Roman Catholic college and university within the archdiocese is affiliated with a religious institute, rather than the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.''\n*[[Alvernia University|Alvernia University - Philadelphia Center ''(branch campus)'']], Cheltenham Township ([[Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis]])\n*[[Cabrini University]], Radnor Township ([[Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]])\n*[[Chestnut Hill College]], Philadelphia ([[Sisters of Saint Joseph]])\n*[[Gwynedd Mercy University]], Lower Gwynedd Township ([[Sisters of Mercy]])\n*[[Holy Family University, Pennsylvania|Holy Family University]], Philadelphia ([[Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth]])\n*[[Immaculata University]], East Whiteland Township ([[Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]])\n*[[La Salle University]], Philadelphia ([[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]])\n*[[Neumann University]], Aston Township ([[Third Order of Saint Francis#Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia|Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia]])\n*[[Rosemont College]], Lower Merion Township ([[Society of the Holy Child Jesus]])\n*[[Saint Joseph's University]], Philadelphia ([[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]])\n*[[Villanova University]], Radnor Township ([[Augustinians]])\n\n==Publications==\n* [[The Catholic Standard & Times]] (former newspaper)\n* [http://CatholicPhilly.com CatholicPhilly.com] (online news site)\n\n==Saints of Philadelphia==\n*[[Mother Cabrini|St. Frances Xavier Cabrini]], for whom the suburban college is named and who visited on numerous occasions.

This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms.

Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=\"royal\">{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/john-conway-11257/|title=John Conway|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his [[Mathematical Games column]] in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29688355 Martin Gardner, puzzle master extraordinaire]'' by [[Colm Mulcahy]], [[BBC News Magazine]], 21 October 2014: \"The Game of Life appeared in Scientific American in 1970, and was by far the most successful of Gardner's columns, in terms of reader response.\"</ref><ref name=topten>Mulcahy (2014).</ref> Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.<ref>[http://mathfactor.uark.edu/2010/06/ha-conway-on-gardner/ The Math Factor Podcast Website] John H. Conway reminisces on his long friendship and collaboration with Martin Gardner.</ref> For instance, he discussed Conway's game of [[Sprouts (game)|Sprouts]] (Jul 1967), [[Hackenbush]] (Jan 1972), and his [[Angel problem|angel and devil problem]] (Feb 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' and even managed to explain Conway's [[surreal numbers]].<ref>Martin Gardner, ''Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers'', W. H. Freeman & Co., 1989, {{ISBN|0-7167-1987-8}}, Chapter 4.

He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the [[Penrose tiling]]s which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.<ref>''[http://www.ams.org/notices/200506/fea-gardner.pdf Interview with Martin Gardner]'' [[Notices of the AMS]], Vol. 52, No. 6, June/July 2005, pp. 602\u2013611</ref> Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.<ref>[https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-conways-life-in-games-20150828/ A Life In Games: The Playful Genius of John Conway] by [[Siobhan Roberts]], [[Quanta Magazine]], 28 August 2015</ref> The cover of that issue of ''Scientific American'' features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.<ref name=topten/>\n\nConferences called [[Gathering 4 Gardner]] are held every two years to celebrate the legacy of Martin Gardner, and Conway himself was often a featured speaker at these events, discussing various aspects of recreational mathematics.<ref>[http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html Presentation Videos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809042801/http://gathering4gardner.org/VIDEOS.html |date=9 August 2016 }} from 2014 Gathering 4 Gardner</ref><ref name= bellos>Bellos, Alex (2008). ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125154530/https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=25 Nov 2017 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=\"royal\">{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/john-conway-11257/|title=John Conway|last=|first=|date=|website=The Royal Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.
