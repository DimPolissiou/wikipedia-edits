Each Ethernet frame starts with an Ethernet header, which contains destination and source [[MAC address]]es as its first two fields.  The middle section of the frame is payload data including any headers for other protocols (for example, [[Internet Protocol]]) carried in the frame.

Values of 1500 and below mean that it is used to indicate the size of the payload in octets, while values of 1536 and above indicate that it is used as an EtherType, to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload of the frame. When used as EtherType, the length of the frame is determined by the location of the [[interpacket gap]] and valid [[frame check sequence]] (FCS).\n\nThe [[IEEE 802.1Q]] tag or [[IEEE 802.1ad]] tag, if present, is a four-octet field that indicates [[virtual LAN]] (VLAN) membership and [[IEEE 802.1p]] priority.  The first two octets of the tag are called the '''T'''ag '''P'''rotocol '''ID'''entifier (TPID) and double as the EtherType field indicating that the frame is either 802.1Q or 802.1ad tagged.  802.1Q uses a TPID of 0x8100.  802.1ad uses a TPID of 0x88a8.\n\n====Payload====\nThe minimum payload is 42 octets when an 802.1Q tag is present and 46 octets when absent.{{Efn|Minimum payload size is dictated by the 512-bit slot time used for [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision detection]] in the Ethernet LAN architecture.}} When the actual payload is less, padding bytes are added accordingly.{{Efn|Both 42 and 46 octet minimums are valid when 802.1Q is present.<ref>IEEE 802.1Q-2011, Annex G</ref>}} The maximum payload is 1500 octets. Non-standard [[jumbo frame]]s allow for larger maximum payload size.\n\n====Frame check sequence====\nThe [[frame check sequence]] (FCS) is a four-octet [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC) that allows detection of corrupted data within the entire frame as received on the receiver side. The standard states that the FCS value is computed as a function of the protected MAC frame fields: source and destination address, length/type field, MAC client data and padding (that is, all fields except the FCS) using the left shifting CRC32 BZIP2 (poly = 0x4C11DB7, initial CRC = 0xFFFFFFFF, CRC is post complemented, verify value = 0x38FB2284). The standard states that data is transmitted least signficant bit (bit 0) first, while the FCS is transmitted most significant bit (bit 31) first.<ref name=\"802.3-2018\" />{{rp|section 3.2.9}} An alternative is to calculate a CRC using the right shifting CRC32 (poly = 0xEDB88320, initial CRC = 0xFFFFFFFF, CRC is post complemented, verify value = 0x2144DF1C), which will result in a CRC that is a bit reversal of the FCS, and transmit both data and the CRC least significant bit first, resulting in identical transmissions. The standard states that the receiver should calculate a new FCS as data is received and then compare the received FCS with the FCS the receiver has calculated. An alternative is to calculate a CRC on both the received data and the FCS, which will result in a fixed non-zero \"verify\" value. (The result is non-zero because the CRC is post complemented during CRC generation).

Differentiation between frame types is possible based on the table on the right.\n\nIn addition, all four Ethernet frame types may optionally contain an IEEE 802.1Q tag to identify what VLAN it belongs to and its priority ([[quality of service]]). This encapsulation is defined in the [[IEEE 802.3ac]] specification and increases the maximum frame by 4 octets.<!--802.3as subsequently increased maximum frame size still further-->\n\nThe IEEE 802.1Q tag, if present, is placed between the Source Address and the EtherType or Length fields. The first two octets of the tag are the Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) value of 0x8100. This is located in the same place as the EtherType/Length field in untagged frames, so an EtherType value of 0x8100 means the frame is tagged, and the true EtherType/Length is located after the Q-tag. The TPID is followed by two octets containing the Tag Control Information (TCI) (the IEEE 802.1p priority ([[quality of service]]) and VLAN id). The Q-tag is followed by the rest of the frame, using one of the types described above.\n\n===Ethernet II===\n'''Ethernet II framing''' (also known as '''DIX Ethernet''', named after [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Intel]] and [[Xerox]], the major participants in its design<ref>{{cite book |title=Drew Heywood's Windows 2000 Network Services |author=Drew Heywood |author2=Zubair Ahmad |publisher=Sams |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-672-31741-5 |page=53}}</ref>), defines the two-octet [[EtherType]] field in an Ethernet [[Frame (telecommunications)|frame]], preceded by destination and source MAC addresses, that identifies an [[upper layer protocol]] [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulated]] by the frame data. For example, an EtherType value of 0x0800 signals that the frame contains an [[IPv4]] datagram.  Likewise, an EtherType of 0x0806 indicates an [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] frame, 0x86DD indicates an [[IPv6]] frame and 0x8100 indicates the presence of an IEEE 802.1Q tag (as described above).\n\n[[Image:Ethernet Type II Frame format.svg|thumb|center|700px|The most common Ethernet Frame format, type II]]\n\nAs this industry-developed standard went through a formal [[IEEE]] standardization process, the EtherType field was changed to a (data) length field in the new 802.3 standard.{{Efn|Original Ethernet frames define their length with the framing that surrounds it, rather than with an explicit length count.}} Since the recipient still needs to know how to interpret the frame, the standard required an [[IEEE 802.2]] header to follow the length and specify the type.  Many years later, the 802.3x-1997 standard, and later versions of the 802.3 standard, formally approved of both types of framing. Ethernet II framing is the most common in Ethernet local area networks, due to its simplicity and lower overhead.\n\nIn order to allow some frames using Ethernet v2 framing and some using the original version of 802.3 framing to be used on the same Ethernet segment, EtherType values must be greater than or equal to 1536 (0x0600).  That value was chosen because the maximum length of the payload field of an Ethernet 802.3 frame is 1500 octets (0x05DC).  Thus if the field's value is greater than or equal to 1536, the frame must be an Ethernet v2 frame, with that field being a type field.<ref>{{cite book|author=LAN MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society|title=IEEE Std 802.3x-1997 and IEEE Std 802.3y-1997|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.|date=20 March 1997|pages=28\u201331}}</ref>  If it's less than or equal to 1500, it must be an IEEE 802.3 frame, with that field being a length field.

Novell used this as a starting point to create the first implementation of its own [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX]] Network Protocol over Ethernet. They did not use any LLC header but started the IPX packet directly after the length field. This does not conform to the IEEE 802.3 standard, but since IPX always has FF as the first two octets (while in IEEE 802.2 LLC that pattern is theoretically possible but extremely unlikely), in practice this usually coexists on the wire with other Ethernet implementations, with the notable exception of some early forms of [[DECnet]] which got confused by this.\n\n[[Novell NetWare]] used this frame type by default until the mid-nineties, and since NetWare was then very widespread, while IP was not, at some point in time most of the world's Ethernet traffic ran over \"raw\" 802.3 carrying IPX. Since NetWare 4.10, NetWare defaults to IEEE 802.2 with LLC (NetWare Frame Type Ethernet_802.2) when using IPX.<ref>{{cite newsgroup | author=Don Provan | title=Ethernet Framing | date=17 September 1993 | newsgroup=comp.sys.novell | message-id=1993Sep17.190654.13335@novell.com | url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.novell/browse_thread/thread/d00a24530625714c }} ([http://www.ee.siue.edu/~bnoble/comp/networks/frametypes.html HTML-formatted version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418013816/http://www.ee.siue.edu/~bnoble/comp/networks/frametypes.html |date=18 April 2015 }}) &nbsp;\u2014 a classic series of Usenet postings by Novell's Don Provan that have found their way into numerous FAQs and are widely considered the definitive answer to the Novell Frame Type usage.</ref>\n\n===IEEE 802.2 LLC===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.2}}\nSome protocols, such as those designed for the [[OSI model|OSI stack]], operate directly on top of IEEE 802.2 LLC encapsulation, which provides both connection-oriented and connectionless network services.\n\nIEEE 802.2 LLC encapsulation is not in widespread use on common networks currently, with the exception of large corporate [[NetWare]] installations that have not yet migrated to NetWare over [[Internet Protocol|IP]]. In the past, many corporate networks used IEEE 802.2 to support transparent translating bridges between Ethernet and [[Token Ring]] or [[FDDI]] networks.\n\nThere exists an [[Internet standard]] for encapsulating IPv4 traffic in IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP frames.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1042\n    | title = RFC1042: A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams over IEEE 802 Networks\n    | publisher = Network Working Group of the IETF\n    | date = February 1988\n  }}\n</ref> It is almost never implemented on Ethernet, although it is used on FDDI, Token Ring, [[IEEE 802.11]] (with the exception of the [[IEEE 802.11p|5.9 GHz band]], where it uses EtherType)<ref>{{Cite book|title=IEEE Std 802.11-2016: Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control IEEE (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications.|last=Computer Society|first=IEEE|publisher=IEEE|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=249}}</ref> and other [[IEEE 802]] LANs. IPv6 can also be transmitted over Ethernet using IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP, but, again, that's almost never used.\n\n===IEEE 802.2 SNAP===\n{{Main|Subnetwork Access Protocol}}\nBy examining the 802.2 LLC header, it is possible to determine whether it is followed by a SNAP header. The LLC header includes two eight-bit address fields, called ''service access points'' (SAPs) in OSI terminology; when both source and destination SAP are set to the value 0xAA, the LLC header is followed by a SNAP header. The SNAP header allows EtherType values to be used with all IEEE 802 protocols, as well as supporting private protocol ID spaces.\n\nIn IEEE 802.3x-1997, the IEEE Ethernet standard was changed to explicitly allow the use of the 16-bit field after the MAC addresses to be used as a length field or a type field.\n\n[[Mac OS]] uses IEEE 802.2 LLC + SNAP encapsulation for the [[AppleTalk]] v2 protocol suite on Ethernet (\"EtherTalk\").\n\n==Maximum throughput==\nWe may calculate the [[protocol overhead]] for Ethernet as a percentage (packet size including IPG)\n:<math>\\text{Protocol overhead} = \\frac{\\text{Packet size} - \\text{Payload size}}{\\text{Packet size}}</math>\nWe may calculate the ''protocol efficiency'' for Ethernet\n:<math>\\text{Protocol efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Payload size}}{\\text{Packet size}}</math>\nMaximum efficiency is achieved with largest allowed payload size and is:\n:<math>\\frac{1500}{1538} = 97.53\\%</math>\nfor untagged frames, since the packet size is maximum 1500 octet payload + 8 octet preamble + 14 octet header + 4 octet trailer + minimum interpacket gap corresponding to 12 octets = 1538 octets. The maximum efficiency is:\n:<math>\\frac{1500}{1542} = 97.28\\%</math>\nwhen 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used.\n\nThe [[throughput]] may be calculated from the efficiency\n:<math>\\text{Throughput} = \\text{Efficiency} \\times \\text{Net bit rate}\\,\\!</math>,\nwhere the physical layer [[net bit rate]] (the wire bit rate) depends on the [[Ethernet physical layer]] standard, and may be 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s or 10 Gbit/s. [[Maximum throughput]] for 100BASE-TX Ethernet is consequently 97.53 Mbit/s without 802.1Q, and 97.28 Mbit/s with 802.1Q.\n\n[[Channel utilization]] is a concept often confused with protocol efficiency. It considers only the use of the channel disregarding the nature of the data transmitted \u2013 either payload or overhead. At the physical layer, the link channel and equipment do not know the difference between data and control frames. We may calculate the [[channel utilization]]:\n\n:<math>\\text{Channel utilization} = \\frac{\\text{Time spent transmitting data}}{\\text{Total time}}</math>\n\nThe total time considers the round trip time along the channel, the processing time in the hosts and the time transmitting data and acknowledgements. The time spent transmitting data includes data and acknowledgements.\n\n=={{Anchor|RUNT-FRAMES}}Runt frames==\nA runt frame is an Ethernet frame that is less than the IEEE 802.3's minimum length of 64 octets.

The connection between a PHY and MAC is independent of the physical medium and uses a bus from the media independent interface family ([[Media Independent Interface|MII]], [[Gigabit Media Independent Interface|GMII]], [[Reduced Gigabit Media Independent Interface|RGMII]], [[Serial Gigabit Media Independent Interface|SGMII]], [[10 Gigabit Media Independent Interface|XGMII]]).  [[Fast Ethernet]] transceiver chips utilize the MII bus, which is a four-bit (one [[nibble]]) wide bus, therefore the preamble is represented as 14 instances of 0xA, and the SFD is 0xA 0xB (as nibbles).

Values of 1500 and below mean that it is used to indicate the size of the payload in octets, while values of 1536 and above indicate that it is used as an EtherType, to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload of the frame. When used as EtherType, the length of the frame is determined by the location of the [[interpacket gap]] and valid [[frame check sequence]] (FCS).\n\nThe [[IEEE 802.1Q]] tag or [[IEEE 802.1ad]] tag, if present, is a four-octet field that indicates [[virtual LAN]] (VLAN) membership and [[IEEE 802.1p]] priority.  The first two octets of the tag are called the '''T'''ag '''P'''rotocol '''ID'''entifier (TPID) and double as the EtherType field indicating that the frame is either 802.1Q or 802.1ad tagged.  802.1Q uses a TPID of 0x8100.  802.1ad uses a TPID of 0x88a8.\n\n====Payload====\nThe minimum payload is 42 octets when an 802.1Q tag is present and 46 octets when absent.{{Efn|Minimum payload size is dictated by the 512-bit slot time used for [[Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection|collision detection]] in the Ethernet LAN architecture.}} When the actual payload is less, padding bytes are added accordingly.{{Efn|Both 42 and 46 octet minimums are valid when 802.1Q is present.<ref>IEEE 802.1Q-2011, Annex G</ref>}} The maximum payload is 1500 octets.

The standard states that data is transmitted least signficant bit (bit 0) first, while the FCS is transmitted most significant bit (bit 31) first.<ref name=\"802.3-2018\" />{{rp|section 3.2.9}} An alternative is to calculate a CRC using the right shifting CRC32 (poly = 0xEDB88320, initial CRC = 0xFFFFFFFF, CRC is post complemented, verify value = 0x2144DF1C), which will result in a CRC that is a bit reversal of the FCS, and transmit both data and the CRC least significant bit first, resulting in identical transmissions. The standard states that the receiver should calculate a new FCS as data is received and then compare the received FCS with the FCS the receiver has calculated. An alternative is to calculate a CRC on both the received data and the FCS, which will result in a fixed non-zero \"verify\" value. (The result is non-zero because the CRC is post complemented during CRC generation). Since the data is received least significant bit first, to avoid having to buffer octet's of data, the receiver typically uses the right shifting CRC32, and the \"verify\" value (sometimes called \"magic check\") is 0x2144DF1C.<ref>https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/user_upload/standards/classic/4-1/AUTOSAR_SWS_CRCLibrary.pdf#page=24</ref> However, hardware implementation of a logically right shifting CRC may use a left shifting [[Linear-feedback shift register#Galois_LFSRs|| Linear Feedback Shift Register]] as the basis for calculating the CRC, reversing the bits, resulting in a verify value of 0x38FB2284, and since the complementing of the CRC may be performed post calculation and during transmission, what remains in the hardware register is an non-complemented result, so the residue for a right shifting implementation would be the complement of 0x2144DF1C = 0xDEBB20E3, and for a left shifting implementation, the complement of 0x38FB2284 = 0xC704DD7B.\n\n=== {{Anchor|EOF|EOD|End of frame}}End of frame \u2013 physical layer ===\nThe ''end of a frame'' is usually indicated by the end-of-data-stream symbol at the physical layer or by loss of the carrier signal; an example is [[10BASE-T]], where the receiving station detects the end of a transmitted frame by loss of the carrier.

Differentiation between frame types is possible based on the table on the right.\n\nIn addition, all four Ethernet frame types may optionally contain an IEEE 802.1Q tag to identify what VLAN it belongs to and its priority ([[quality of service]]). This encapsulation is defined in the [[IEEE 802.3ac]] specification and increases the maximum frame by 4 octets.<!--802.3as subsequently increased maximum frame size still further-->\n\nThe IEEE 802.1Q tag, if present, is placed between the Source Address and the EtherType or Length fields. The first two octets of the tag are the Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) value of 0x8100. This is located in the same place as the EtherType/Length field in untagged frames, so an EtherType value of 0x8100 means the frame is tagged, and the true EtherType/Length is located after the Q-tag. The TPID is followed by two octets containing the Tag Control Information (TCI) (the IEEE 802.1p priority ([[quality of service]]) and VLAN id). The Q-tag is followed by the rest of the frame, using one of the types described above.\n\n===Ethernet II===\n'''Ethernet II framing''' (also known as '''DIX Ethernet''', named after [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Intel]] and [[Xerox]], the major participants in its design<ref>{{cite book |title=Drew Heywood's Windows 2000 Network Services |author=Drew Heywood |author2=Zubair Ahmad |publisher=Sams |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-672-31741-5 |page=53}}</ref>), defines the two-octet [[EtherType]] field in an Ethernet [[Frame (telecommunications)|frame]], preceded by destination and source MAC addresses, that identifies an [[upper layer protocol]] [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulated]] by the frame data. For example, an EtherType value of 0x0800 signals that the frame contains an [[IPv4]] datagram.  Likewise, an EtherType of 0x0806 indicates an [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] frame, 0x86DD indicates an [[IPv6]] frame and 0x8100 indicates the presence of an IEEE 802.1Q tag (as described above).\n\n[[Image:Ethernet Type II Frame format.svg|thumb|center|700px|The most common Ethernet Frame format, type II]]\n\nAs this industry-developed standard went through a formal [[IEEE]] standardization process, the EtherType field was changed to a (data) length field in the new 802.3 standard.{{Efn|Original Ethernet frames define their length with the framing that surrounds it, rather than with an explicit length count.}} Since the recipient still needs to know how to interpret the frame, the standard required an [[IEEE 802.2]] header to follow the length and specify the type.  Many years later, the 802.3x-1997 standard, and later versions of the 802.3 standard, formally approved of both types of framing. Ethernet II framing is the most common in Ethernet local area networks, due to its simplicity and lower overhead.\n\nIn order to allow some frames using Ethernet v2 framing and some using the original version of 802.3 framing to be used on the same Ethernet segment, EtherType values must be greater than or equal to 1536 (0x0600).  That value was chosen because the maximum length of the payload field of an Ethernet 802.3 frame is 1500 octets (0x05DC).  Thus if the field's value is greater than or equal to 1536, the frame must be an Ethernet v2 frame, with that field being a type field.<ref>{{cite book|author=LAN MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society|title=IEEE Std 802.3x-1997 and IEEE Std 802.3y-1997|publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.|date=20 March 1997|pages=28\u201331}}</ref>  If it's less than or equal to 1500, it must be an IEEE 802.3 frame, with that field being a length field.  Values between 1500 and 1536, exclusive, are undefined.<ref>IEEE Std 802.3-2005, 3.2.6</ref> This convention allows software to determine whether a frame is an Ethernet II frame or an IEEE 802.3 frame, allowing the coexistence of both standards on the same physical medium.\n\n===Novell raw IEEE 802.3===\nNovell's \"raw\" 802.3 frame format was based on early IEEE 802.3 work. Novell used this as a starting point to create the first implementation of its own [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX]] Network Protocol over Ethernet. They did not use any LLC header but started the IPX packet directly after the length field. This does not conform to the IEEE 802.3 standard, but since IPX always has FF as the first two octets (while in IEEE 802.2 LLC that pattern is theoretically possible but extremely unlikely), in practice this usually coexists on the wire with other Ethernet implementations, with the notable exception of some early forms of [[DECnet]] which got confused by this.\n\n[[Novell NetWare]] used this frame type by default until the mid-nineties, and since NetWare was then very widespread, while IP was not, at some point in time most of the world's Ethernet traffic ran over \"raw\" 802.3 carrying IPX. Since NetWare 4.10, NetWare defaults to IEEE 802.2 with LLC (NetWare Frame Type Ethernet_802.2) when using IPX.<ref>{{cite newsgroup | author=Don Provan | title=Ethernet Framing | date=17 September 1993 | newsgroup=comp.sys.novell | message-id=1993Sep17.190654.13335@novell.com | url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.novell/browse_thread/thread/d00a24530625714c }} ([http://www.ee.siue.edu/~bnoble/comp/networks/frametypes.html HTML-formatted version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418013816/http://www.ee.siue.edu/~bnoble/comp/networks/frametypes.html |date=18 April 2015 }}) &nbsp;\u2014 a classic series of Usenet postings by Novell's Don Provan that have found their way into numerous FAQs and are widely considered the definitive answer to the Novell Frame Type usage.</ref>\n\n===IEEE 802.2 LLC===\n{{Main|IEEE 802.2}}\nSome protocols, such as those designed for the [[OSI model|OSI stack]], operate directly on top of IEEE 802.2 LLC encapsulation, which provides both connection-oriented and connectionless network services.\n\nIEEE 802.2 LLC encapsulation is not in widespread use on common networks currently, with the exception of large corporate [[NetWare]] installations that have not yet migrated to NetWare over [[Internet Protocol|IP]]. In the past, many corporate networks used IEEE 802.2 to support transparent translating bridges between Ethernet and [[Token Ring]] or [[FDDI]] networks.\n\nThere exists an [[Internet standard]] for encapsulating IPv4 traffic in IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP frames.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1042\n    | title = RFC1042: A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams over IEEE 802 Networks\n    | publisher = Network Working Group of the IETF\n    | date = February 1988\n  }}\n</ref> It is almost never implemented on Ethernet, although it is used on FDDI, Token Ring, [[IEEE 802.11]] (with the exception of the [[IEEE 802.11p|5.9 GHz band]], where it uses EtherType)<ref>{{Cite book|title=IEEE Std 802.11-2016: Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control IEEE (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications.|last=Computer Society|first=IEEE|publisher=IEEE|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=249}}</ref> and other [[IEEE 802]] LANs. IPv6 can also be transmitted over Ethernet using IEEE 802.2 LLC SAP/SNAP, but, again, that's almost never used.\n\n===IEEE 802.2 SNAP===\n{{Main|Subnetwork Access Protocol}}\nBy examining the 802.2 LLC header, it is possible to determine whether it is followed by a SNAP header. The LLC header includes two eight-bit address fields, called ''service access points'' (SAPs) in OSI terminology; when both source and destination SAP are set to the value 0xAA, the LLC header is followed by a SNAP header. The SNAP header allows EtherType values to be used with all IEEE 802 protocols, as well as supporting private protocol ID spaces.\n\nIn IEEE 802.3x-1997, the IEEE Ethernet standard was changed to explicitly allow the use of the 16-bit field after the MAC addresses to be used as a length field or a type field.\n\n[[Mac OS]] uses IEEE 802.2 LLC + SNAP encapsulation for the [[AppleTalk]] v2 protocol suite on Ethernet (\"EtherTalk\").\n\n==Maximum throughput==\nWe may calculate the [[protocol overhead]] for Ethernet as a percentage (packet size including IPG)\n:<math>\\text{Protocol overhead} = \\frac{\\text{Packet size} - \\text{Payload size}}{\\text{Packet size}}</math>\nWe may calculate the ''protocol efficiency'' for Ethernet\n:<math>\\text{Protocol efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Payload size}}{\\text{Packet size}}</math>\nMaximum efficiency is achieved with largest allowed payload size and is:\n:<math>\\frac{1500}{1538} = 97.53\\%</math>\nfor untagged frames, since the packet size is maximum 1500 octet payload + 8 octet preamble + 14 octet header + 4 octet trailer + minimum interpacket gap corresponding to 12 octets = 1538 octets. The maximum efficiency is:\n:<math>\\frac{1500}{1542} = 97.28\\%</math>\nwhen 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used.\n\nThe [[throughput]] may be calculated from the efficiency\n:<math>\\text{Throughput} = \\text{Efficiency} \\times \\text{Net bit rate}\\,\\!</math>,\nwhere the physical layer [[net bit rate]] (the wire bit rate) depends on the [[Ethernet physical layer]] standard, and may be 10 Mbit/s, 100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s or 10 Gbit/s. [[Maximum throughput]] for 100BASE-TX Ethernet is consequently 97.53 Mbit/s without 802.1Q, and 97.28 Mbit/s with 802.1Q.\n\n[[Channel utilization]] is a concept often confused with protocol efficiency. It considers only the use of the channel disregarding the nature of the data transmitted \u2013 either payload or overhead. At the physical layer, the link channel and equipment do not know the difference between data and control frames. We may calculate the [[channel utilization]]:\n\n:<math>\\text{Channel utilization} = \\frac{\\text{Time spent transmitting data}}{\\text{Total time}}</math>\n\nThe total time considers the round trip time along the channel, the processing time in the hosts and the time transmitting data and acknowledgements. The time spent transmitting data includes data and acknowledgements.\n\n=={{Anchor|RUNT-FRAMES}}Runt frames==\nA runt frame is an Ethernet frame that is less than the IEEE 802.3's minimum length of 64 octets. Runt frames are most commonly caused by [[Collision (telecommunications)|collisions]]; other possible causes are a malfunctioning [[network card]], [[buffer underrun]], [[duplex mismatch]] or software issues.<ref>\n  {{cite web\n    | url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/internetworking/troubleshooting/guide/tr1904.html\n    | title=Troubleshooting Ethernet\n    | publisher = Cisco Systems\n    | access-date = 2016-08-13\n  }}\n</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Wikiversity|Topic:Web Science/Part1: Foundations of the web/Internet Architecture/Ethernet}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:How to build an Ethernet Frame.webm|Video which explains how to build an Ethernet Frame\nFile:Minimum Frame Length in Ethernet explained.webm|Minimum Frame Length in Ethernet explained\n</gallery>\n\n{{Ethernet}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ethernet Frame}}\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Ethernet|Frame]]\n\n[[de:Datenframe]]\n", "name_user": "109.76.44.105", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(access granted)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame"}

Influenced by the film, he purchased his first camera and began taking night classes in [[photography]] at the [[School of Visual Arts]] of New York.

The results appear as a relentlessly cruel catalogue of ugliness, showing a complete lack of respect. As a consequence, many street photographers are dissociating from Gilden and claiming that he gives the genre a bad reputation which in turn compromises the personal safety of every person who is taking pictures in public places. Contemporary American photographer [[Joel Meyerowitz]] has this to say about Gilden: \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking bully. I despise the work, I despise the attitude, he\u2019s an aggressive bully and all the pictures look alike because he only has one idea\u2014\u2018I\u2019m gonna embarrass you, I\u2019m going to humiliate you.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, but no.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2016/07/29/dont-take-picture-street-photography-public-privacy/|title=Don\u2019t Take My Picture: Street Photography and Public Privacy|last=CORRAL|first=JILL|date=July 29, 2016|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Publications by Gilden===\n*''The Small Haiti Portfolio (Limited Edition)'', Helsinki, Finland, 1990.\n*''Facing New York'', Manchester, UK: [[Cornerhouse]] Publications, 1992. {{ISBN|978-0-948797-07-1}}.

It is one of the largest and most important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in [[Europe]]. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the [[Avignon Papacy|seat]] of [[Western Christianity]] during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of [[Benedict XII]] in 1334, [[Clement VI]] in 1342, [[Innocent VI]] in 1352, [[Urban V]] in 1362, [[Gregory XI]] in 1370 and [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] in 1394.\n\n==Description==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of [[Benedict XII]], which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of [[Clement VI]], the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages, it is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France\u2019s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), [[Simone Martini]] and [[Matteo Giovanetti]].\n\nIn addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of \"belles-lettres\", amongst them the founder of [[humanism]], [[Petrarch]]. At the same time, composers, singers and musicians were drawn to the Great Chapel of the Palais. It was there that [[Clement VI]] used the ''Mass of Notre-Dame'' of [[Guillaume de Machaut]], there that [[Philippe de Vitry]] at the pope\u2019s invitation presented his ''[[Ars Nova]],'' and there that [[Johannes Ciconia]] came to study.\n\nDue to its immense size, the Palais was also the place where the general organisation of the Church began to change. It facilitated the centralisation of services and the adaptation of operations in order to suit the needs of the papacy, creating a truly central administration for the Church.<ref>Yves Renouard, La Papaut\u00e9 \u00e0 Avignon, p. 7.</ref> The manpower of the [[Curia]] (Church administration), while 200 at the end of the 13th century, surpassed 300 at the beginning of the 14th century and reached 500 people in 1316. To this were added over 1,000 lay officials working within the Palais.<ref name=\"auto\">Raymond Dugrand et Robert Ferras, article Avignon, in La Grande Encyclop\u00e9die, T. III, p. 1354-1355, \u00c9d. Larousse, Paris, 1972, {{ISBN|2-03-000903-2}} (pour le T. III).</ref>\n\nDespite this, the Palais became obsolete when the papacy found it necessary to return to Rome. The hope of reuniting Latin and Orthodox Christians, along with the achievement of peace in the Papal States in Italy, made the case of returning stronger. Added to that was the strong conviction of both [[Urban V]] and [[Gregory XI]] that the seat of the papacy could only be the tomb of St Peter. Despite strong opposition from the Court of France and the [[College of Cardinals]], both popes found the means to return to Rome, the first, on 30 April 1362, the second on 13 September 1370. This time, the return was absolute.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn the following centuries, the Palais lost all of its former glory, despite serving as the seat of two [[anti-popes]] and many cardinals. It retained, however, a \u201cwork of destruction\u201d aspect that French poets and writers such as [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert]] have referred to over the centuries, with its powerful sense of beauty, simplicity, grandeur and immortality.<ref>Du vandalisme en France \u2013 Lettre \u00e0 M. Victor Hugo, Charles de Montalembert, Revue des Deux Mondes, tome 1, janv. \u2013 mars 1833</ref>\n\nSince 1995, the Palais des Papes has been classified, along with the historic center of Avignon, as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], under cultural criteria i, ii and iv.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/228 |title=Centre historique d\u2019Avignon: Palais des papes, ensemble \u00e9piscopal et Pont d\u2019Avignon|trans-title=Historic Centre of Avignon: Palais des papes together with the Pont d'Avignon |language=French |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Avignon palais.jpg|right|thumb|Plan of the palace in 1914.]]\nThe Palais construction began in AD 1252. Avignon became the residence of the [[Pope]]s in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as [[Pope Clement V]], unwilling to face the violent chaos of [[Rome]] after his election (1305), moved the [[Papal Curia]] to Avignon during the[[Avignon Papacy|\"Avignon Papacy]]\". Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor [[Pope John XXII]] set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by [[Pope Benedict XII]] (1334\u201342) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]], was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the ''Palais Vieux'' (Old Palace) and ''Palais Neuf'' (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of {{convert|11000|m\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.\n\nThe Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.\n\n[[File:Palais des papes grand chapel.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Grand Chapel, where the Avignon popes worshiped.]]\n\nUnder Popes [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]], [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] and [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]], the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.\n\n[[File:Main entrance of the Palais des Papes - 20050823.jpg|thumb|250px|The fa\u00e7ade of the palais neuf]]\n\nThe popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the [[Papal Schism of 1378|Papal Schism]] during which time the [[antipope]]s [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] made Avignon their home until 1403. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for five years after being besieged in 1398 when the army of [[Geoffrey Boucicaut]] occupied Avignon. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years \u2013 it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 \u2013 but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.\n\nAlthough the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and [[Comtat Venaissin]]) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.\n\n[[File:Avignon Papal Palace - Court d'honneur.jpg|thumb|Cour d'honneur]]\n\nThe Palais was subsequently taken over by the [[Napoleonic]] French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables \u2013 the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed \u2013 this ensured the shell of the building's physical survival. It was vacated in only 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.\n\nCharles Dickens describes a tour around this building in his book:Pictures from Italy. His guide he describes as a she-devil with flashing black eyes who glories in the gory past when the building was used as a torture chamber.<ref>Charles Dickens: Pictures From Italy, 1846</ref>\n\n==Present==\n[[File:Avignon, Palais des Papes by JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|Le palais des Papes]]\nThe Palais is today a historical and architectural landmark and primarily a tourist attraction, attracting around 650,000 visitors per annum, putting it regularly in the top ten most visited attractions in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palais-des-papes.com/pages/pdpaccueil.html|title=Palais des Papes \u2013 Avignon|website=Palais-des-papes.com|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> It also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the ''[[departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Vaucluse]], which include a research centre on the papacy of Avignon, organised jointly by the [[Roman Historical Institutes|\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome]] and the ''institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes''.\n\nThe Palais regularly serves as an exhibition centre. The first major exhibition was initiated by [[Ren\u00e9 Char]], in the Grand Chapel between 27 and 30 June 1947. Entitled \"Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines\" (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the [[Festival d'Avignon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8pDrHAAACAAJ&dq=palais+papes+exposition&hl=fr ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the [[Festival d'Avignon]], which is held every year in July.

The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study, as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art, or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n===The Great Tinel===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\n\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food.

It is one of the largest and most important [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] buildings in [[Europe]]. Once a fortress and palace, the papal residence was the [[Avignon Papacy|seat]] of [[Western Christianity]] during the 14th century. Six papal conclaves were held in the Palais, leading to the elections of [[Benedict XII]] in 1334, [[Clement VI]] in 1342, [[Innocent VI]] in 1352, [[Urban V]] in 1362, [[Gregory XI]] in 1370 and [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] in 1394.\n\n==Description==\nThe Palais is actually two joined buildings: the old palais of [[Benedict XII]], which sits on the impregnable rock of Doms, and the new palais of [[Clement VI]], the most extravagant of the Avignon popes. Together they form the largest Gothic building of the Middle Ages, it is also one of the best examples of the International Gothic architectural style. The construction design was the work of two of France\u2019s best architects, Pierre Peysson and Jean de Louvres, and the lavish ornamentation was the work of two of the best students of the School of Siena (Italy), [[Simone Martini]] and [[Matteo Giovanetti]].\n\nIn addition, the papal library housed in the Palais (the largest in Europe at the time with over 2,000 volumes), attracted a group of clerics passionate in the study of \"belles-lettres\", amongst them the founder of [[humanism]], [[Petrarch]]. At the same time, composers, singers and musicians were drawn to the Great Chapel of the Palais. It was there that [[Clement VI]] used the ''Mass of Notre-Dame'' of [[Guillaume de Machaut]], there that [[Philippe de Vitry]] at the pope\u2019s invitation presented his ''[[Ars Nova]],'' and there that [[Johannes Ciconia]] came to study.\n\nDue to its immense size, the Palais was also the place where the general organisation of the Church began to change. It facilitated the centralisation of services and the adaptation of operations in order to suit the needs of the papacy, creating a truly central administration for the Church.<ref>Yves Renouard, La Papaut\u00e9 \u00e0 Avignon, p. 7.</ref> The manpower of the [[Curia]] (Church administration), while 200 at the end of the 13th century, surpassed 300 at the beginning of the 14th century and reached 500 people in 1316. To this were added over 1,000 lay officials working within the Palais.<ref name=\"auto\">Raymond Dugrand et Robert Ferras, article Avignon, in La Grande Encyclop\u00e9die, T. III, p. 1354-1355, \u00c9d. Larousse, Paris, 1972, {{ISBN|2-03-000903-2}} (pour le T. III).</ref>\n\nDespite this, the Palais became obsolete when the papacy found it necessary to return to Rome. The hope of reuniting Latin and Orthodox Christians, along with the achievement of peace in the Papal States in Italy, made the case of returning stronger. Added to that was the strong conviction of both [[Urban V]] and [[Gregory XI]] that the seat of the papacy could only be the tomb of St Peter. Despite strong opposition from the Court of France and the [[College of Cardinals]], both popes found the means to return to Rome, the first, on 30 April 1362, the second on 13 September 1370. This time, the return was absolute.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn the following centuries, the Palais lost all of its former glory, despite serving as the seat of two [[anti-popes]] and many cardinals. It retained, however, a \u201cwork of destruction\u201d aspect that French poets and writers such as [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert]] have referred to over the centuries, with its powerful sense of beauty, simplicity, grandeur and immortality.<ref>Du vandalisme en France \u2013 Lettre \u00e0 M. Victor Hugo, Charles de Montalembert, Revue des Deux Mondes, tome 1, janv. \u2013 mars 1833</ref>\n\nSince 1995, the Palais des Papes has been classified, along with the historic center of Avignon, as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], under cultural criteria i, ii and iv.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/228 |title=Centre historique d\u2019Avignon: Palais des papes, ensemble \u00e9piscopal et Pont d\u2019Avignon|trans-title=Historic Centre of Avignon: Palais des papes together with the Pont d'Avignon |language=French |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Avignon palais.jpg|right|thumb|Plan of the palace in 1914.]]\nThe Palais construction began in AD 1252. Avignon became the residence of the [[Pope]]s in 1309, when the Gascon Bertrand de Goth, as [[Pope Clement V]], unwilling to face the violent chaos of [[Rome]] after his election (1305), moved the [[Papal Curia]] to Avignon, a period known as the [[Avignon Papacy]]. Clement lived as a guest in the Dominican monastery at Avignon, and his successor [[Pope John XXII]] set up a magnificent establishment there, but the reconstruction of the old bishops' palace was begun in earnest by [[Pope Benedict XII]] (1334\u201342) and continued by his successors to 1364. The site, on a natural rocky outcrop at the northern edge of Avignon, overlooking the river [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]], was that of the old episcopal palace of the bishops of Avignon. The Palais was built in two principal phases with two distinct segments, known as the ''Palais Vieux'' (Old Palace) and ''Palais Neuf'' (New Palace). By the time of its completion, it occupied an area of {{convert|11000|m\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. The building was enormously expensive, consuming much of the papacy's income during its construction.\n\nThe Palais Vieux was constructed by the architect Pierre Poisson of Mirepoix at the instruction of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. The austere Benedict had the original episcopal palace razed and replaced with a much larger building centred on a cloister, heavily fortified against attackers. Its four wings are flanked with high towers.\n\n[[File:Palais des papes grand chapel.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The Grand Chapel, where the Avignon popes worshiped.]]\n\nUnder Popes [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]], [[Pope Innocent VI|Innocent VI]] and [[Pope Urban V|Urban V]], the building was expanded to form what is now known as the Palais Neuf. An architect, Jean de Louvres, was commissioned by Clement VI to build a new tower and adjoining buildings, including a 52 m long Grand Chapel to serve as the location for papal acts of worship. Two more towers were built under Innocent VI. Urban V completed the main courtyard (known as the Court d'Honneur) with further buildings enclosing it. The interior of the building was sumptuously decorated with frescos, tapestries, paintings, sculptures and wooden ceilings.\n\n[[File:Main entrance of the Palais des Papes - 20050823.jpg|thumb|250px|The fa\u00e7ade of the palais neuf]]\n\nThe popes departed Avignon in 1377, returning to Rome, but this prompted the [[Papal Schism of 1378|Papal Schism]] during which time the [[antipope]]s [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] made Avignon their home until 1403. The latter was imprisoned in the Palais for five years after being besieged in 1398 when the army of [[Geoffrey Boucicaut]] occupied Avignon. The building remained in the hands of antipapal forces for some years \u2013 it was besieged from 1410 to 1411 \u2013 but was returned to the authority of papal legates in 1433.\n\nAlthough the Palais remained under papal control (along with the surrounding city and [[Comtat Venaissin]]) for over 350 years afterwards, it gradually deteriorated despite a restoration in 1516. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out in 1789 it was already in a bad state when it was seized and sacked by revolutionary forces. In 1791 it became the scene of a massacre of counter-revolutionaries, whose bodies were thrown into the Tour des Latrines in the Palais Vieux.\n\n[[File:Avignon Papal Palace - Court d'honneur.jpg|thumb|Cour d'honneur]]\n\nThe Palais was subsequently taken over by the [[Napoleonic]] French state for use as a military barracks and prison. Although it was further damaged by the military occupation, especially under the anti-clerical [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], when the remaining interior woodwork was cleared away for use of the structure as a stables \u2013 the frescos were covered over and largely destroyed \u2013 this ensured the shell of the building's physical survival. It was vacated in only 1906, when it became a national museum. It has been under virtually constant restoration ever since.\n\nCharles Dickens describes a tour around this building in his book:Pictures from Italy. His guide he describes as a she-devil with flashing black eyes who glories in the gory past when the building was used as a torture chamber.<ref>Charles Dickens: Pictures From Italy, 1846</ref>\n\n==Present==\n[[File:Avignon, Palais des Papes by JM Rosier.jpg|thumb|Le palais des Papes]]\nThe Palais is today a historical and architectural landmark and primarily a tourist attraction, attracting around 650,000 visitors per annum, putting it regularly in the top ten most visited attractions in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palais-des-papes.com/pages/pdpaccueil.html|title=Palais des Papes \u2013 Avignon|website=Palais-des-papes.com|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> It also houses a large convention centre and the archives of the ''[[departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Vaucluse]], which include a research centre on the papacy of Avignon, organised jointly by the [[Roman Historical Institutes|\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise de Rome]] and the ''institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes''.\n\nThe Palais regularly serves as an exhibition centre. The first major exhibition was initiated by [[Ren\u00e9 Char]] and in the Grand Chapel between 27 and 30 June 1947. Entitled \"Exposition de peintures et sculptures contemporaines\" (Exposition of contemporary painters and sculptors), it was the starting point for what would later become the [[Festival d'Avignon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8pDrHAAACAAJ&dq=palais+papes+exposition&hl=fr ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard of the Palais des Papes is a central performance location during the [[Festival d'Avignon]] ''In'', which is held every year in July.

The subject matter, while common in contemporary secular art, is as unexpected in a room supposedly dedicated to study, as it is for a room in a papal apartment. The frescoes were probably painted by French artists, who were either highly influenced by Sienese art, or assisted by Simone Martini and/or Matteo Giovanetti, both of whom served as Clement's court painter.\n\n===The Great Tinel===\nThis room was used primarily as a reception room. Covered with tapestries on starry blue background, there is actually nothing left of these sets. Indeed, a fire destroyed the palace in the 14th century: many parts have been restored or rebuilt.\n\nDuring conclaves, it is in this room that the cardinals met to elect a new pope. For the occasion, the room was walled and only a small opening was left open to provide all the necessary food. After each conclave, the walls were destroyed, revealing a vaulted room opening to the rest of the palace.\n\n===The chapels===\n====Saint-Martial chapel====\n[[File:Plafond de la chapelle Saint-Martial, par JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|Inside the Saint-Martial chapel]]\nLocated on the second level of the Saint-Jean tower, the ''[[Saint-Martial]] chapel'' relates through painting the main parts of Saint Martial's life.

Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a [[lunisolar calendar]] similar to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]]. (See also [[Computus]] and [[Reform of the date of Easter]].) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 7, Chapter 18}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35880795|title=Why can't the date of Easter be fixed|publisher=BBC|language=English|author=Caroline Wyatt|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> within about seven days after the astronomical full moon.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter].

Because of the thirteen-day difference between the calendars between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian calendar (the Julian calendar is no longer used as the civil calendar of the countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate). Also, because the Julian \"full moon\" is always several days after the astronomical full moon, the eastern Easter is often later, relative to the visible Moon's phases, than western Easter.\n\nAmong the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] some churches have changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and the date for Easter as for other fixed and moveable feasts is the same as in the Western church.<ref>\"The Church in Malankara switched entirely to the Gregorian calendar in 1953, following Encyclical No. 620 from Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I, dt.

The full moon referred to (called the [[Paschal full moon]]) is not an astronomical full moon, but the [[ecclesiastical full moon|14th day]] of a [[lunar month]].

Their starting point in determining the date of Orthodox Easter is also 21 March but according to the Julian reckoning, which in the current century corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIn addition, the lunar tables of the Julian calendar are four days (sometimes five days) behind those of the Gregorian calendar. The 14th day of the lunar month according to the Gregorian system is figured as the ninth or tenth day according to the Julian. The result of this combination of solar and lunar discrepancies is divergence in the date of Easter in most years (see table).\n\nEaster is determined on the basis of [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] cycles. The lunar year consists of 30-day and 29-day lunar months, generally alternating, with an [[embolismic month]] added periodically to bring the lunar cycle into line with the solar cycle. In each solar year (1 January to 31 December inclusive), the lunar month beginning with an [[ecclesiastical new moon]] falling in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive is designated as the paschal lunar month for that year.<ref name=\"smart.net\">Montes, Marcos J.

For the British Empire and colonies, a determination of the date of Easter Sunday using [[Golden number (time)|Golden Numbers]] and [[Sunday letter]]s was defined by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] with its Annexe. This was designed to match exactly the Gregorian calculation.\n\n=== Controversies over the date ===\n{{main|Easter controversy}}\n[[File:5part-icon.jpeg|thumb|right|A five-part [[Russian Orthodox]] icon depicting the Easter story.<br>Eastern Orthodox Christians use a different computation for the date of Easter than the Western churches.]]\nThe precise date of Easter has at times been a matter of contention. By the later 2nd century, it was widely accepted that the celebration of the holiday was a practice of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and an undisputed tradition. The [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodeciman]] controversy, the first of several [[Easter controversy|Easter controversies]], arose concerning the date on which the holiday should be celebrated.\n\nThe term \"Quartodeciman\" refers to the practice of celebrating Easter on [[Nisan]] 14 of the [[Hebrew calendar]], \"the {{LORD}}'s passover\" ({{bibleverse || Leviticus|23:5}}). According to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], the Quartodeciman [[Polycarp]] (bishop of Smyrna, by tradition a disciple of [[John the Apostle]]) debated the question with [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] (bishop of Rome). The [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman province of Asia]] was Quartodeciman, while the Roman and Alexandrian churches continued the fast until the Sunday following (the Sunday of Unleavened Bread), wishing to associate Easter with Sunday. Neither Polycarp nor Anicetus persuaded the other, but they did not consider the matter [[schism (religion)|schismatic]] either, parting in peace and leaving the question unsettled.\n\nControversy arose when [[Pope Victor I|Victor]], bishop of Rome a generation after Anicetus, attempted to excommunicate [[Polycrates of Ephesus]] and all other bishops of Asia for their Quartodecimanism. According to Eusebius, a number of synods were convened to deal with the controversy, which he regarded as all ruling in support of Easter on Sunday.<ref>Eusebius, Church History 5.23.</ref> Polycrates (''circa'' 190), however, wrote to Victor defending the antiquity of Asian Quartodecimanism. Victor's attempted excommunication was apparently rescinded, and the two sides reconciled upon the intervention of bishop [[Irenaeus]] and others, who reminded Victor of the tolerant precedent of Anicetus.\n\nQuartodecimanism seems to have lingered into the 4th century, when [[Socrates of Constantinople]] recorded that some Quartodecimans were deprived of their churches by [[John Chrysostom]]<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'', 6.11, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Of Severian and Antiochus: their Disagreement from John.| work = Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library|date=13 July 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.ix.xii.html| accessdate =28 March 2009}}</ref> and that some were harassed by [[Nestorius]].<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'' 7.29, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Nestorius of Antioch promoted to the See of Constantinople.

But both those who followed the Nisan 14 custom, and those who set Easter to the following Sunday had in common the custom of consulting their Jewish neighbors to learn when the month of Nisan would fall, and setting their festival accordingly. By the later 3rd century, however, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the custom of relying on the Jewish community to determine the date of Easter. The chief complaint was that the Jewish communities sometimes erred in setting Passover to fall before the [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring equinox.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church Histor''y, 7.32.</ref><ref>Peter of Alexandria, quoted in the [[Chronicon Paschale]].

This effectively required the abandonment of the old custom of consulting the Jewish community in those places where it was still used. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote in the mid-4th century:\n\n<blockquote>the emperor&nbsp;... convened a council of 318 bishops&nbsp;... in the city of Nicea&nbsp;... They passed certain ecclesiastical canons at the council besides, and at the same time decreed in regard to the Passover that there must be one unanimous concord on the celebration of God's holy and supremely excellent day.

Brill |year=1994 | location = Leiden | page = 331}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThat the older custom (called \"protopaschite\" by historians) did not at once die out, but persisted for a time, is indicated by the existence of canons<ref>Apostolic Canon 7: \"If any bishop, presbyter, or deacon shall celebrate the holy day of Easter before the vernal equinox with the Jews, let him be deposed.\" ''A Select Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church,'' Second Series, Volume 14: The Seven Ecumenical Councils, Eerdmans, 1956, p. 594.</ref> and sermons<ref>St. John Chrysostom, \"Against those who keep the first Passover\", in ''Saint John Chrysostom: Discourses against Judaizing Christians'', translated by Paul W. Harkins, Washington, DC, 1979, pp. 47ff.</ref> against it.\n\n[[Dionysius Exiguus]], and others following him, maintained that the 318 Bishops assembled at the Nicene Council had specified a particular method of determining the date of Easter; subsequent scholarship has refuted this tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=50\u201352, 62\u201365}}</ref> In any case, in the years following the council, the computational system that was worked out by the church of Alexandria came to be normative. It took a while for the Alexandrian rules to be adopted throughout Christian Europe, however. The [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] originally employed was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise on the measurement of Easter, after which Rome used his 84-year [[lunisolar calendar]] cycle until 457.

From this time, therefore, all discrepancies between Alexandria and Rome as to the correct date for Easter cease, as both churches were using identical tables.\n\nEarly Christians in Britain and Ireland also used an 84-year cycle. From the 5th century onward this cycle set its equinox to 25 March and fixed Easter to the Sunday falling in the 14th to the 20th of the lunar month inclusive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A.|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-954312-0|pages=223\u2013224}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Holford-Strevens, Leofranc|first=and Blackburn, Bonnie|title=The Oxford Companion to the Year|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-214231-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00blac/page/870 870\u2013875]|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00blac/page/870}}</ref> This 84-year cycle was replaced by the Alexandrian method in the course of the 7th and 8th centuries.

Since 1582, when the Catholic Church adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]] while the Eastern Orthodox and most Oriental Orthodox Churches retained the [[Julian calendar]], the date on which Easter is celebrated has again differed.\n\nThe Greek island of [[Syros]], whose population is divided almost equally between Catholics and Orthodox, is one of the few places where the two Churches share a common date for Easter, with the Catholics accepting the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] date\u2014a practice helping considerably in maintaining good relations between the two communities.<ref>{{cite news| title= Easter: A date with God | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18584376 | date=20 April 2011 | newspaper=The Economist | accessdate=23 April 2011| quote= Only in a handful of places do Easter celebrants alter their own arrangements to take account of their neighbours.

The Sunday before Easter is [[Palm Sunday]], with the Wednesday before Easter being known as [[Spy Wednesday]]. The last [[The Three Days|three days]] before Easter are [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] (sometimes referred to as Silent Saturday).\n\nPalm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday respectively commemorate Jesus' entry in Jerusalem, the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Crucifixion]]. Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday are sometimes referred to as the [[Easter Triduum]] ([[Latin]] for \"Three Days\"). Many churches begin celebrating Easter late in the evening of Holy Saturday at a service called the [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nThe week beginning with Easter Sunday is called [[Easter Week]] or the [[Octave of Easter]], and each day is prefaced with \"Easter\", e.g. [[Easter Monday]] (a public holiday in many countries), [[Easter Tuesday]] (a much less widespread public holiday), etc. [[Easter Saturday]] is therefore the Saturday ''after'' Easter Sunday. The day before Easter is properly called Holy Saturday. [[Eastertide]], or Paschaltide, the season of Easter, begins on Easter Sunday and lasts until the day of [[Pentecost]], seven weeks later.\n\n=== Eastern Christianity ===\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], the spiritual preparation for Easter begins with [[Great Lent]], which starts on [[Clean Monday]] and lasts for 40 continuous days (including Sundays). The last week of Great Lent (following the fifth Sunday of Great Lent) is called Palm Week, and ends with [[Lazarus Saturday]]. The [[Vespers]] which begins Lazarus Saturday officially brings Great Lent to a close, although the fast continues through the following week. After Lazarus Saturday comes [[Palm Sunday]], [[Holy Week]], and finally Easter itself, and the fast is broken immediately after the Paschal [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nThe [[Paschal Vigil]] begins with the [[Midnight Office]], which is the last service of the [[Lenten Triodion]] and is timed so that it ends a little before midnight on [[Holy Saturday]] night. At the stroke of midnight the Paschal celebration itself begins, consisting of Paschal [[Matins]], [[Paschal Hours]], and Paschal Divine Liturgy.<ref name=\"Eastern Liturgy\">{{cite web | last = Lash | first = Ephrem (Archimandrite) | title = On the Holy and Great Sunday of Pascha | publisher = Monastery of Saint Andrew the First Called, Manchester, England | date = 25 January 2007 | url = http://www.anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | accessdate = 27 March 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409193104/http://anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | archivedate = 9 April 2007}}</ref> Placing the Paschal Divine Liturgy at midnight guarantees that no Divine Liturgy will come earlier in the morning, ensuring its place as the pre-eminent \"Feast of Feasts\" in the [[liturgical year]].\n\nThe liturgical season from Easter to the Sunday of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]) is known as the [[Pentecostarion]] (the \"50 days\"). The week which begins on Easter Sunday is called [[Bright Week]], during which there is no fasting, even on Wednesday and Friday. The [[Afterfeast]] of Easter lasts 39 days, with its [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] (leave-taking) on the day before [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].

In this spirit, these Christians teach that each day and all [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbaths]] should be kept holy, in Christ's teachings. [[Jewish Christians|Hebrew-Christian]], [[Sacred Name Movement|Sacred Name]], and [[Armstrongism|Armstrong]] movement churches (such as the [[Living Church of God]]) usually reject Easter in favor of Nisan 14 observance and celebration of the [[Christian Passover]]. This is especially true of Christian groups that celebrate the [[New Moon]]s or annual [[High Sabbaths]] in addition to [[seventh-day Sabbath]]. They support this textually with reference to the letter to the Colossians {{bibleverse-nb||Colossians|2:16-17|ASV}}: \"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a sabbath day: which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's.\"\n\n== Easter celebrations around the world ==\n{{Main|Easter customs}}\nIn [[Christian countries]] where Christianity is a [[state religion]], or where the country has large Christian population, Easter is often a [[public holiday]]. As Easter is always a Sunday, many countries in the world also have Easter Monday as a public holiday. Some retail stores, shopping malls, and restaurants are closed on Easter Sunday. [[Good Friday]], which occurs two days before Easter Sunday, is also a public holiday in many countries, as well as in 12 U.S. states. Even in states where Good Friday is not a holiday, many financial institutions, stock markets, and public schools are closed. The few banks that are normally open on regular Sundays are closed on Easter.\n\nIn the [[Nordic countries]] Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday are public holidays,<ref>Public holidays in Scandinavian countries, for example; {{cite web|title=Public holidays in Sweden|url=http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/sweden-facts/worth-knowing-about-sweden/public-holidays|publisher=VisitSweden|accessdate=10 April 2014}}<br>{{cite web|title=Public holidays [in Denmark]|url=http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/public-holidays|publisher=VisitDenmark|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> and Good Friday and Easter Monday are [[bank holiday]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bank Holidays|url=http://www.nordea.com/About+Nordea/Contact/Bank+Holidays/1541152.html|publisher=[[Nordea|Nordea Bank AB]]|accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In Denmark, Iceland and Norway [[Maundy Thursday]] is also a public holiday.

In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], either Good Friday or Easter Monday are statutory holidays (although most companies give both). In some countries [[Good Friday]] is a public holiday as well.\n\nIn [[Australia]], because of its location in the southern hemisphere, Easter takes place in autumn.

Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a [[lunisolar calendar]] similar to the [[Hebrew calendar]]. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of [[Easter controversy|controversies]]. (See also [[Computus]] and [[Reform of the date of Easter]].) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Sozomen|loc=Book 7, Chapter 18}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35880795|title=Why can't the date of Easter be fixed|publisher=BBC|language=English|author=Caroline Wyatt|date=25 March 2016|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> within about seven days after the astronomical full moon.<ref>[http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/easter.php The Date of Easter].

Because of the thirteen-day difference between the calendars between 1900 and 2099, 21 March corresponds, during the 21st century, to 3 April in the [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Easter therefore varies between 4 April and 8 May in the Gregorian calendar (the Julian calendar is no longer used as the civil calendar of the countries where Eastern Christian traditions predominate). Also, because the Julian \"full moon\" is always several days after the astronomical full moon, the eastern Easter is often later, relative to the visible Moon's phases, than western Easter.\n\nAmong the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] some churches have changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and the date for Easter as for other fixed and moveable feasts is the same as in the Western church.<ref>\"The Church in Malankara switched entirely to the Gregorian calendar in 1953, following Encyclical No. 620 from Patriarch Mor Ignatius Aphrem I, dt.

Their starting point in determining the date of Orthodox Easter is also 21 March but according to the Julian reckoning, which in the current century corresponds to 3 April in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIn addition, the lunar tables of the Julian calendar are four days (sometimes five days) behind those of the Gregorian calendar. The 14th day of the lunar month according to the Gregorian system is figured as the ninth or tenth day according to the Julian. The result of this combination of solar and lunar discrepancies is divergence in the date of Easter in most years (see table).\n\nEaster is determined on the basis of [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] cycles. The lunar year consists of 30-day and 29-day lunar months, generally alternating, with an [[embolismic month]] added periodically to bring the lunar cycle into line with the solar cycle. In each solar year (1 January to 31 December inclusive), the lunar month beginning with an [[ecclesiastical new moon]] falling in the 29-day period from 8 March to 5 April inclusive is designated as the paschal lunar month for that year.<ref name=\"smart.net\">Montes, Marcos J.

For the British Empire and colonies, a determination of the date of Easter Sunday using [[Golden number (time)|Golden Numbers]] and [[Sunday letter]]s was defined by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]] with its Annexe. This was designed to match exactly the Gregorian calculation.\n\n=== Controversies over the date ===\n{{main|Easter controversy}}\n[[File:5part-icon.jpeg|thumb|right|A five-part [[Russian Orthodox]] icon depicting the Easter story.<br>Eastern Orthodox Christians use a different computation for the date of Easter than the Western churches.]]\nThe precise date of Easter has at times been a matter of contention. By the later 2nd century, it was widely accepted that the celebration of the holiday was a practice of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and an undisputed tradition. The [[Quartodecimanism|Quartodeciman]] controversy, the first of several [[Easter controversy|Easter controversies]], arose concerning the date on which the holiday should be celebrated.\n\nThe term \"Quartodeciman\" refers to the practice of celebrating Easter on [[Nisan]] 14 of the [[Hebrew calendar]], \"the {{LORD}}'s passover\" ({{bibleverse || Leviticus|23:5}}). According to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], the Quartodeciman [[Polycarp]] (bishop of Smyrna, by tradition a disciple of [[John the Apostle]]) debated the question with [[Pope Anicetus|Anicetus]] (bishop of Rome). The [[Asia (Roman province)|Roman province of Asia]] was Quartodeciman, while the Roman and Alexandrian churches continued the fast until the Sunday following (the Sunday of Unleavened Bread), wishing to associate Easter with Sunday. Neither Polycarp nor Anicetus persuaded the other, but they did not consider the matter [[schism (religion)|schismatic]] either, parting in peace and leaving the question unsettled.\n\nControversy arose when [[Pope Victor I|Victor]], bishop of Rome a generation after Anicetus, attempted to excommunicate [[Polycrates of Ephesus]] and all other bishops of Asia for their Quartodecimanism. According to Eusebius, a number of synods were convened to deal with the controversy, which he regarded as all ruling in support of Easter on Sunday.<ref>Eusebius, Church History 5.23.</ref> Polycrates (''circa'' 190), however, wrote to Victor defending the antiquity of Asian Quartodecimanism. Victor's attempted excommunication was apparently rescinded, and the two sides reconciled upon the intervention of bishop [[Irenaeus]] and others, who reminded Victor of the tolerant precedent of Anicetus.\n\nQuartodecimanism seems to have lingered into the 4th century, when [[Socrates of Constantinople]] recorded that some Quartodecimans were deprived of their churches by [[John Chrysostom]]<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'', 6.11, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Of Severian and Antiochus: their Disagreement from John.| work = Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories| publisher = Calvin College Christian Classics Ethereal Library|date=13 July 2005| url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.ix.xii.html| accessdate =28 March 2009}}</ref> and that some were harassed by [[Nestorius]].<ref>Socrates, ''Church History'' 7.29, at {{cite web| last = Schaff| first = Philip| title = Nestorius of Antioch promoted to the See of Constantinople.

But both those who followed the Nisan 14 custom, and those who set Easter to the following Sunday had in common the custom of consulting their Jewish neighbors to learn when the month of Nisan would fall, and setting their festival accordingly. By the later 3rd century, however, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the custom of relying on the Jewish community to determine the date of Easter. The chief complaint was that the Jewish communities sometimes erred in setting Passover to fall before the [[Northern Hemisphere]] spring equinox.<ref>Eusebius, ''Church Histor''y, 7.32.</ref><ref>Peter of Alexandria, quoted in the [[Chronicon Paschale]].

This effectively required the abandonment of the old custom of consulting the Jewish community in those places where it was still used. [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] wrote in the mid-4th century:\n\n<blockquote>the emperor&nbsp;... convened a council of 318 bishops&nbsp;... in the city of Nicea&nbsp;... They passed certain ecclesiastical canons at the council besides, and at the same time decreed in regard to the Passover that there must be one unanimous concord on the celebration of God's holy and supremely excellent day.

It took a while for the Alexandrian rules to be adopted throughout Christian Europe, however. The [[octaeteris|8-year cycle]] originally employed was replaced by (or by the time of) [[Augustalis (bishop)|Augustalis]]'s treatise on the measurement of Easter, after which Rome used his 84-year [[lunisolar calendar]] cycle until 457.

The week before Easter, known as [[Holy Week]], is very special in the Christian tradition. The Sunday before Easter is [[Palm Sunday]], with the Wednesday before Easter being known as [[Spy Wednesday]]. The last [[The Three Days|three days]] before Easter are [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]] and [[Holy Saturday]] (sometimes referred to as Silent Saturday).\n\nPalm Sunday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday respectively commemorate Jesus' entry in Jerusalem, the [[Last Supper]] and the [[Crucifixion]]. Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday are sometimes referred to as the [[Easter Triduum]] ([[Latin]] for \"Three Days\"). Many churches begin celebrating Easter late in the evening of Holy Saturday at a service called the [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nThe week beginning with Easter Sunday is called [[Easter Week]] or the [[Octave of Easter]], and each day is prefaced with \"Easter\", e.g. [[Easter Monday]] (a public holiday in many countries), [[Easter Tuesday]] (a much less widespread public holiday), etc. [[Easter Saturday]] is therefore the Saturday ''after'' Easter Sunday. The day before Easter is properly called Holy Saturday. [[Eastertide]], or Paschaltide, the season of Easter, begins on Easter Sunday and lasts until the day of [[Pentecost]], seven weeks later.\n\n=== Eastern Christianity ===\n\nIn [[Eastern Christianity]], the spiritual preparation for Easter begins with [[Great Lent]], which starts on [[Clean Monday]] and lasts for 40 continuous days (including Sundays). The last week of Great Lent (following the fifth Sunday of Great Lent) is called Palm Week, and ends with [[Lazarus Saturday]]. The [[Vespers]] which begins Lazarus Saturday officially brings Great Lent to a close, although the fast continues through the following week. After Lazarus Saturday comes [[Palm Sunday]], [[Holy Week]], and finally Easter itself, and the fast is broken immediately after the Paschal [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nThe [[Paschal Vigil]] begins with the [[Midnight Office]], which is the last service of the [[Lenten Triodion]] and is timed so that it ends a little before midnight on [[Holy Saturday]] night. At the stroke of midnight the Paschal celebration itself begins, consisting of Paschal [[Matins]], [[Paschal Hours]], and Paschal Divine Liturgy.<ref name=\"Eastern Liturgy\">{{cite web | last = Lash | first = Ephrem (Archimandrite) | title = On the Holy and Great Sunday of Pascha | publisher = Monastery of Saint Andrew the First Called, Manchester, England | date = 25 January 2007 | url = http://www.anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | accessdate = 27 March 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070409193104/http://anastasis.org.uk/pascha.htm | archivedate = 9 April 2007}}</ref> Placing the Paschal Divine Liturgy at midnight guarantees that no Divine Liturgy will come earlier in the morning, ensuring its place as the pre-eminent \"Feast of Feasts\" in the [[liturgical year]].\n\nThe liturgical season from Easter to the Sunday of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] (the Sunday after [[Pentecost]]) is known as the [[Pentecostarion]] (the \"50 days\"). The week which begins on Easter Sunday is called [[Bright Week]], during which there is no fasting, even on Wednesday and Friday. The [[Afterfeast]] of Easter lasts 39 days, with its [[Afterfeast|Apodosis]] (leave-taking) on the day before [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]].
