Most modern laptops feature integrated [[webcam]]s and built-in [[microphone]]s, while many also have [[touchscreen]]s. Laptops can be powered either from an internal [[Electric battery|battery]] or by an external [[mains electricity|power supply]] from an [[AC adapter]]. Hardware specifications, such as the processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, makes, models and [[price point]]s.\n\nDesign elements, [[form factor (design)|form factor]] and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include [[rugged computer|rugged notebooks]] for use in construction or [[military applications]], as well as [[cost of goods sold|low production cost]] laptops such as those from the [[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) organization, which incorporate features like [[solar power|solar charging]] and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers. [[Portable computer]]s, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small [[niche market]], mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or for traveling sales representatives. As the portable computers evolved into the modern laptop, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.<ref name=NPD>{{cite web|title=U.S. Commercial Channel Computing Device Sales Set to End 2013 with Double-Digit Growth, According to NPD|url=https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/u-s-commercial-channel-computing-device-sales-set-to-end-2013-with-double-digit-growth-according-to-npd/|website=NPD Group|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Terminology variants==\nThe terms ''laptop'' and ''notebook'' are used interchangeably to describe a portable computer in English, although in some parts of the world one or the other may be preferred.

Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5\" drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5\" and smaller drives around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives. Optical storage, [[read-only memory|read-only]] CD-ROM followed by writeable CD and later read-only or writeable DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] players, became common in laptops early in the 2000s.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Compaqarmada7800.jpg|thumb|[[Compaq]] Armada laptop from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Macbook Air.jpg|thumb|Apple [[MacBook Air]], an ultraportable laptop weighing under {{convert|3.0|lb|kg|2|abbr=on}}]]\n[[File:ThinkPad X220.jpg|thumb|[[Lenovo]]'s [[ThinkPad]] business laptop, originally an [[IBM]] product]]\n\n[[File:Asus Transformer Pad TF701T Tablet and Keyboard Dock.png|thumb|[[ASUS Transformer|Asus Transformer Pad]], a hybrid tablet, powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Operating system|OS]]]]\n[[File:Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with Type Cover.jpg|thumb|[[Microsoft Surface Pro 3]], 2-in-1 detachable]]\n[[File:Alienware.JPG|thumb|[[Alienware]] gaming laptop]]\n[[Image:Toughbook-cf-m34 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toughbook|Panasonic Toughbook]] CF-M34, a rugged laptop/subnotebook]]\n\nSince the introduction of portable computers during the late 1970s, their form has changed significantly, [[spawning]] a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.  Except where there is a distinct legal [[trademark]] around a term (notably [[Ultrabook]]), there are rarely hard distinctions between these classes and their usage has varied over time and between different sources.\n\n===Traditional laptop===\nThe form of the traditional laptop computer is a clamshell, with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite, facing the screen. It can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling. The screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed. Devices of this form are commonly called a 'traditional laptop' or notebook, particularly if they have a screen size of 11 to 17 inches measured diagonally and run a full-featured operating system like [[Windows 10]], [[macOS]], or [[GNU]]/[[Linux_kernel|Linux]]. Traditional laptops are the most common form of laptops, although [[Chromebook]]s, Ultrabooks, convertibles and 2-in-1s (described below) are becoming more common, with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms.\n\n===Subnotebook===\n{{Main|Subnotebook}}\n\nA ''subnotebook'' or an ''ultraportable'', is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability (small size, low weight, and often longer battery life). Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred.

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use.

Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts.

Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters. [[Google]], with its updated version of [[Chromebook Pixel]], shows a similar transition trend towards USB-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices.<ref name=ChromebookPixel_2015>{{cite web|title=Chromebook Pixel|url=https://www.google.com/chromebook/pixel/|website=google.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Although being common until the end of the 2000s decade, [[Ethernet]] network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of [[wireless network]]ing, such as [[Wi-Fi]]. [[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk. The study, which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of 21 and 35, found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as {{convert|2.1|C-change|0}}.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop.<ref>{{cite web| title = Gartner: Notebook PCs still prone to hardware failure| date = 27 June 2006| publisher = IDG News Service / ITWorld| url = http://www.itworld.com/060627notebookpc| accessdate =27 November 2008}}</ref> To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or [[microfiber]] cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup. In 2006, 7 major ODMs manufactured 7 of every 10 laptops in the world, with the largest one ([[Quanta Computer]]) having 30% of world market share.<ref>{{cite web |title=Identical Laptops, Different Prices: Don't Be Fooled by Branding |url-access=registration |publisher=Info-Tech Research Group |date=10 October 2006 |url= http://www.infotech.com/research/identical-laptops-different-prices-dont-be-fooled-by-branding |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> Therefore, identical models are available both from a major label and from a low-profile ODM in-house brand.\n\n=== Market share ===\nBattery-powered portable computers had just 2% worldwide market share in 1986.<ref>{{cite news| title = Lap-top computers gain stature as power grows| work = Daily News of Los Angeles (CA)| date = 12 April 1987| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LA&p_theme=la&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EF513A9C40DA46F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\">{{cite web| title = The Falling Costs of Mobile Computing| work = Falling Costs of Mobile Computing Drive Corporate Adoption| publisher = Computer Economics, Inc.|date=December 2005| url = http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1084| accessdate =1 November 2008 }}</ref> Around 109 million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in 2007, a growth of 33% compared to 2006.<ref name=\"ssev2011-09-12\">[http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20080131PD209.html Worldwide notebook shipments grow 33% on year in 2007, says IDC], 31 January 2008, Yen Ting Chen, DigiTimes, retrieved at 12 September 2011</ref> In 2008 it was estimated that 145.9 million notebooks were sold, and that the number would grow in 2009 to 177.7 million.<ref name=\"ee2009-01-10\">[http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=YN1M2POYEMEN0QSNDLSCKHA?articleID=212701251 Analysis: Did Intel underestimate netbook success?], Accessed at 10 January 2009</ref> The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded [[Desktop computer|desktops]], with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units.<ref name=\"Computer Economics, Inc\"/><ref name=\"is2009-01-13\">[http://www.isuppli.com/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=19823 Notebook PC Shipments Exceed Desktops for First Time in Q3], isuppli.com, accessed at 13 January 2009</ref><ref name=\"NYT09\">{{cite news| title =The PC Doesn't Have to Be an Anchor|work=The New York Times|author= Randall Stross| date =18 April 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/business/19digi.html?_r=1&ref=technology| accessdate =20 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |title=Intel: laptop/desktop crossover coming sooner than expected |work=The Register, UK |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007091449/http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/04/17/intel_laptop_desktop_crossover/ |archive-date=7 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMay 2005 was the first time notebooks outsold desktops in the US over the course of a full month; at the time notebooks sold for an average of $1,131 while desktops sold for an average of $696.<ref>Michael Singer.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.

Subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops, weighing between 0.8 and 2&nbsp;kg (2-5&nbsp;lb),<ref name=\"types_pcmag\" /> with a battery life exceeding 10 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |title=Breaking the Mold: New Lenovo ThinkPad laptop and Tablet PCs Defy Ultraportable Computing |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=Lenovo |date=23 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106182812/http://www.lenovo.com/news/us/en/2008/09/x200s_x200tablet.html |archive-date=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since the introduction of ''netbooks'' and ''ultrabooks'', the line between ''subnotebooks'' and either category has blurred. Netbooks are a more basic and cheaper type of subnotebook, and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks, certain ultrabooks fit in the subnotebook category. One notable example of a subnotebook is the [[Apple MacBook Air]].\n\n===Netbook===\n{{main|Netbook}}\n\nThe netbook is an inexpensive, light-weight, energy-efficient form of laptop, especially suited for wireless communication and Internet access.<ref name=\"upenn\">{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/the-net-impact-of-netbooks-it-depends-on-who-uses-them-for-what/|title=The Net Impact of Netbooks?

The ''hybrids'', ''convertibles'' and ''2-in-1s'' emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a [[touchscreen]] display designed to allow users to work in a ''tablet'' mode, using either [[multi-touch]] gestures or a [[stylus (computing)|stylus]]/[[digital pen]].\n\n''Convertibles'' are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. ''Hybrids'' have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. ''2-in-1s'' can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed ''2-in-1 detachables'' and ''2-in-1 convertibles'' respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop [[operating system|OS]], such as [[Windows 10]]. 2-in-1s are often marketed as ''laptop replacement tablets''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/best-2-in-1-pcs-in-2020-when-you-need-a-laptop-and-tablet-in-one/|title=Best 2-in-1 PCs in 2020 for when you need a laptop and tablet in one|website=CNet|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>.\n\n2-in-1s are often very thin, around {{convert|10|mm}}, and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an [[x86]]-architecture [[CPU]] (typically a low- or [[Ultra-low-voltage processor|ultra-low-voltage]] model), such as the Intel [[Intel Core|Core i5]], run a full-featured desktop [[operating system|OS]] like [[Windows 10]], and have a number of typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[Mini DisplayPort]].\n\n2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a [[media consumption]] device, but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run ''desktop'' applications, such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It is possible to connect multiple [[peripheral]] devices, such as a mouse, keyboard and a number of external displays to a modern 2-in-1.\n\n[[Microsoft Surface]] Pro-series devices and [[Surface Book]] are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachables, whereas [[Lenovo Yoga]]-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older [[Surface RT]] and [[Surface 2]] have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] and [[Windows RT]] do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/laptop-faqs/what-is-hybrid/|title=What Is a Hybrid Laptop? {{!}} Advantages & Buying Guide {{!}} Lenovo US|website=www.lenovo.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a [[mobile operating system]], such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. These include [[Asus Transformer|Asus's Transformer Pad]] devices, examples of [[hybrid tablet|hybrids]] with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.\n\n===Desktop replacement===\n{{Main|Desktop replacement computer}}\n{{See also|Gaming computer#Gaming laptop computers}}\n\nA desktop-replacement laptop is a class of large device which is not intended primarily for mobile use. These devices are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops, and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer.<ref name=\"types_cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7602_7-1016082-2.html |title=Laptop Buying Guide |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. }}</ref> Desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops. They are capable of containing more powerful components and have a 15-inch or larger display.<ref name=\"types_cnet\"/> Desktop replacement laptops' operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops; in rare cases they have no [[battery (electricity)|battery]] at all. In the past, some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of battery life, although this practice has largely died out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com/2100-1040-979763.html |title=Desktop notebooks stake their claim |accessdate=7 November 2008 |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |date=8 January 2003 }}</ref> The names ''Media Center Laptops'' and ''Gaming Laptops'' are used to describe specialized notebook computers, often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor.<ref name=\"types_pcmag\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2311016,00.asp |title= Types of Laptops: How Do You Compute |accessdate=7 November 2008 |work=PC Magazine |publisher=Ziff Davis Publishing Holdings Inc. |date=18 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Rugged laptop===\n{{Main|Rugged computer}}\n\nA rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch, rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/rugged-laptop.html |title=Rugged Laptop: Choices, Pointers &amp; Specs of Buying Rugged Laptops |accessdate=27 November 2008 |publisher=Linux-on-laptops.com}}</ref> and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.\n\nThe design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under the keyboard keys, sealed port and connector covers, passive cooling, very bright displays easily readable in daylight, cases and frames made of lightweight magnesium alloys that are much stronger than plastics found in commercial laptops, and solid-state storage devices or hard disk drives that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations. Rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services (police, fire, and medical emergency), military, utilities, field service technicians, construction, mining, and oil drilling personnel. Rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations rather than individuals, and are rarely marketed via retail channels.\n\n===Business laptop===\nA business laptop is a laptop designed for those in a workplace. Typically, it is ruggedised, with consumer facing features, like high resolution [[sound card|sound]], removed to allow the device to be used for pure productivity. It may sometimes include business oriented features like [[Trusted Platform Module]], [[Fingerprint|fingerprint scanner]], [[smart card|smart card reader]] and/or a [[pointing stick]].\n\n==Hardware==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2016|small=y}}\n{{Main|Personal computer hardware}}\n[[Image:Motherboards.png|thumb|right|Miniaturization: a comparison of a desktop computer motherboard ([[ATX]] form factor) to a motherboard from a 13\" laptop (2008 unibody [[Macbook]])]]\n[[Image:Laptop innen.jpg|thumb|right|Inner view of a [[VAIO|Sony VAIO]] laptop]]\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SODIMM]] memory module]]\n\nThe basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] and adapted to mobile use, although desktop systems increasingly use the same smaller, lower-power parts which were originally developed for mobile use. The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=D\u00e9 specialist voor smartphone, tablet en laptop reparaties|title=Laptop reparatie|url=https://www.smart-repair.nl/laptop/|accessdate=30 March 2017|work=Smartrepair Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Tilburg, Almere en Utrecht|agency=www.smart-repair.nl|date=4 January 2013|language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable, with the exception of components which can be detached, such as a battery or CD/CDR/DVD drive. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large \"tower\" cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new [[motherboard]]s, [[hard disk]]s, [[sound card]]s, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and other components can be added. In a very compact laptop, such as laplets, there may be no upgradeable components at all.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+3+Teardown/26595|website=iFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]], and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards and inability to upgrade components.<ref>{{cite web|title=Common Building Blocks Platform,|url=http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516184350/http://cache-www.intel.com/cd/00/00/25/59/255996_255996.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2006|publisher=Intel|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe following sections summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.<ref name=\"parts-kate\">{{cite web |title = What Makes Laptops Work&nbsp;\u2013 The Laptop Motherboard |url = http://mobileoffice.about.com/od/laptopstabletpcs/tp/laptopmotherboards.htm |author = Catherine Roseberry |publisher = About.com |accessdate =15 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Display===\nInternally, a display is an LCD panel which could be CCFL or LED [[Backlight|backlit]] which interfaces to the laptop using the [[LVDS]] protocol, while externally, it can be a glossy screen or a matte screen. Most modern laptops feature a {{convert|13|in|cm}} [[viewable image size|VIS]] or larger color [[active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix display]] based on [[LED]] lighting with resolutions of 1280\u00d7800 ([[16:10]]) or 1366\u00d7768 ([[16:9]]) pixels and above. Models with LED-based lighting offer lower power consumption and often increased brightness. [[Netbook]]s with a {{convert|10|in|cm}} or smaller screen typically use a resolution of 1024\u00d7600, while netbooks and [[subnotebook]]s with an {{convert|11.6|in|cm}} or {{convert|12|in|cm}} screen use standard notebook resolutions. Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the [[MacBook Pro with Retina display]] in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of very-high-resolution (1920\u00d71080 and higher) displays, even in relatively small systems, and in typical 15-inch screens resolutions as high as 3200\u00d71800 are available. External displays can be connected to most laptops, and models with a [[Mini DisplayPort]] can handle up to three.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\"/>\n\n===Central processing unit===\nA laptop's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Typically, laptop CPUs made after 2018 have four processor cores, although 6-core and 8-core models are also available. For low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts.\n\nThere have been a wide range of [[notebook processors|CPUs designed for laptops]] available from both [[Intel]], [[AMD]], and other manufacturers. On non-[[x86]] architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former [[PowerPC]]-based Apple laptops ([[iBook]] and [[PowerBook]]). Many laptops have removable CPUs, although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been towards thinner and lighter models. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable; this is nearly universal in ultrabooks.\n\nIn the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life, but the practice was largely extinct as of 2013. Unlike their desktop counterparts, laptop CPUs are nearly impossible to [[overclocking|overclock]]. A thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking\u2013related operating temperature increase. The possibility of improving a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely difficult to implement.\n\n===Graphical processing unit===\nOn most laptops a [[graphical processing unit]] (GPU) is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the [[Intel Core|Core i-series]] of mobile processors in 2010, and similar [[accelerated processing unit]] (APU) processors by AMD later that year. Prior to that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the [[chipset#Computers|system chipset]], while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving [[3D computer graphics|3D]] graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years. Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated, and in some cases even dual, graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is no demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient integrated graphics processor will be used. [[Nvidia Optimus]] and [[AMD Hybrid Graphics]] are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.\n\n===Memory===\nMost laptops use [[SO-DIMM]] (small outline dual in-line memory module) [[random-access memory|memory]] modules, as they are about half the size of desktop [[DIMM]]s.<ref name=\"parts-kate\"/> They are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some of the lowest-end models will have only one, and some high end models (usually mobile engineering workstations and a few high-end models intended for gaming) have four slots. Most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 4-8 GB of RAM. with higher-end laptops containing 16 GB of RAM or more. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1\u20132 GB of RAM and are generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all. Laptops may have memory soldered to the motherboard to conserve space, which allows the laptop to have a thinner chassis design. Soldered memory cannot be easily upgraded.\n\n===Internal storage===\nTraditionally, laptops had a [[hard disk drive]] (HDD) as a main [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile storage]], but these proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to high power consumption, heat production, and a presence of moving parts, which can cause damage to both the drive itself and the data stored when a laptop is unstable physically, e.g. during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop. With the advent of [[flash memory]] technology, most mid- to high-end laptops opted for more compact, power efficient, and fast [[solid-state drive]]s (SSD), which eliminated the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop's physical impacts.<ref name=PCW-SSD>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/evolution_of_the_solid_state_drive.html|website=PCWorld.com|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=17 January 2012}}</ref>  Most laptops use 2.5-inch drives, which are a smaller version of a 3.5-inch desktop drive form factor. 2.5-inch HDDs are more compact, power efficient, and produce less heat, while at the same time have a smaller capacity and a slower [[Hard disk drive performance characteristics#Data transfer rate|data transfer rate]]. Some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs. For SSDs, however, these miniaturization-related trade-offs are nonexistent, because SSDs were designed to have a very small footprint. SSDs feature a traditional 2.5- or 1.8-inch or a laptop-specific [[mSATA]] or [[M.2]] card's form factor. SSDs have a higher data transfer rate, lower power consumption, lower failure rate, and a larger capacity<ref name=\"behardware 2011\">BeHardware reported lower retailer return rates for SSDs than HDDs between April and October 2010. {{cite web | url=http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | title=Components returns rates | date=6 May 2011 | publisher=BeHardware | first=Marc | last=Prieur | accessdate=10 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214142908/http://www.behardware.com/articles/831-7/components-returns-rates.html | archive-date=14 February 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>A 2011 study by [[Intel]] on the use of 45,000 SSDs reported an annualized failure rate of 0.61% for SSDs, compared with 4.85% for HDDs. {{cite web | url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/it-management/intel-it/intel-it-validating-reliability-of-intel-solid-state-drives-brief.html | title=Validating the Reliability of Intel\u00ae Solid-State Drives |publisher=Intel|date=July 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"behardware 2012\">{{cite web | url = http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | publisher = BeHardware | title = Components returns rates (7) | first = Marc | last = Prieur | date = 16 November 2012 | accessdate = 25 August 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130809033951/http://www.behardware.com/articles/881-7/components-returns-rates-7.html | archive-date = 9 August 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Samsung 16TB SSD is the World's Largest Hard Drive|url = http://petapixel.com/2015/08/15/samsung-16tb-ssd-is-the-worlds-largest-hard-drive/|website = PetaPixel|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}</ref> compared to HDDs. However, HDDs have a significantly lower cost.\n\nMost laptops can contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives. Some laptops support a hybrid mode, combining a 2.5-inch drive, typically a spacious HDD for data, with an mSATA or M.2 SDD drive, typically having less capacity, but a significantly faster read/write speed. The [[operating system]] partition would be located on the SSD to increase laptop [[I/O]] performance. Another way to increase performance is to use a smaller SSD of 16-32 GB as a [[Hybrid drive#Dual-drive hybrid systems|cache drive]] with a compatible OS. Some laptops may have very limited drive upgradeability when the [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] used has a non-standard shape or requires a proprietary daughter card.<ref name=\"IFI-rMBP\">{{cite web|title=MacBook Pro 15\" Retina Display Late 2013 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Retina+Display+Late+2013+Teardown/18696|website=IFixit.com|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref> Some laptops have very limited space on the installed SSD, instead relying on availability of [[cloud storage]] services for storing of user data; [[Chromebooks]] are a prominent example of this approach. A variety of [[Hard disk drive#External hard disk drives|external HDDs]] or [[Network-attached storage|NAS]] data storage servers with support of [[RAID]] technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[eSATA]], or [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a [[card reader]] which allows for use of [[memory card]]s, such as those used for [[digital camera]]s, which are typically [[Secure Digital|SD]] or [[microSD]] cards. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card's contents to free up space for taking new pictures.\n\n===Removable media drive===\n[[Optical disc drive]]s capable of playing [[CD-ROM]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CD), [[DVD#DVD drives and players|DVDs]], and in some cases, [[Blu-ray|Blu-ray disc]]s (BD),  were nearly universal on full-sized models by the early 2010s. A disc drive remains fairly common in laptops with a screen wider than {{convert|15|in|cm}}, although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players; these drives are uncommon in compact laptops, such as subnotebooks and netbooks. Laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor, and usually have a standard [[mSATA]] connector. It is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model. In certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive, using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied.\n\n===Inputs===\n[[File:Acer CB5-311 series touchpad.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a [[touchpad]] on an [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] laptop]]\n[[File:Trackpoint Assembly.JPG|thumb|200px|Closeup of a [[TrackPoint]] cursor and UltraNav buttons on a [[ThinkPad]] laptop]]\nAn alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text and data and make other commands (e.g., [[function key]]s). A [[touchpad]] (also called a trackpad), a [[pointing stick]], or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard<ref>Most keyboards are not illuminated. Some models of laptop feature an illuminated keyboard.</ref> is used for typing. An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a [[USB]] port or wirelessly, via [[Bluetooth]] or similar technology. With the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input on screens by 2010-era operating systems, such as [[Windows 8.1]], [[multitouch]] [[touchscreen]] displays are used in many models. Some models have [[webcam]]s and [[microphone]]s, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via [[Skype]], [[Google Hangouts Chat|Google Chat]] and similar software.\nLaptops typically have USB ports and a microphone jack, for use with an external mic. Some laptops have a [[card reader]] for reading digital camera SD cards.\n\n===Input/output (I/O) ports===\nOn a typical laptop there are several [[USB]] [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s, an external monitor port ([[VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], [[HDMI]] or [[Mini DisplayPort]]), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, utilizing [[DisplayPort#Multi-Stream Transport|multi-stream transport]] technology.<ref name=\"3-Displays FAQ\">{{cite web|title=Configuration 3-Displays FAQ|url=http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033714.htm|website=Intel.com|accessdate=16 September 2014}}</ref> [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], in a 2015 version of its [[MacBook]], transitioned from a number of different [[I/O]] ports to a single [[USB-C]] port.<ref name=MacBook_2015>{{cite web|title=Apple \u2014 MacBook \u2014 Tech Specs|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook/specs/|website=apple.com|accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] adapters.

[[Legacy port]]s such as a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] keyboard/mouse port, [[serial port]], [[parallel port]], or [[FireWire]] are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] ports, but [[Thunderbolt 3]] uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect external headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.\n\n===Expansion cards===\nIn the past, a [[PC Card]] (formerly [[PCMCIA]]) or [[ExpressCard]] slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of [[USB 3.0]]. Some internal subsystems such as: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is [[PCI Express]], which comes in both [[PCI Express Mini Card|mini]] and even smaller [[M.2]] sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see [[Micro SATA#mSATA|Micro SATA]] (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid state drives.<ref name=\"parts-cards\">{{cite web|title=Innovations in Notebook Expansion |url=http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428031253/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/89  |archive-date=28 April 2005 |author=Gabriel Torres |date=25 November 2004 |publisher=Hardware Secrets, LLC |accessdate=15 November 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Battery and power supply ===\n{{Main|Smart battery}}\n[[File:HP Laptop Battery.jpg|thumb|Almost all laptops use [[Smart battery|smart batteries]]]]\n2016-era laptops use [[lithium ion]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], with some thinner models using the flatter [[lithium polymer]] technology. These two technologies have largely replaced the older [[nickel metal-hydride]] batteries. Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |title=HP EliteBook 6930p Notebook PC specifications \u2013 HP Products and Services Products |publisher=H10010.www1.hp.com |date=25 May 2009 |access-date=17 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601103622/http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/sm/WF06a/321957-321957-64295-89315-89315-3688868.html?dnr=1 |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA laptop's battery is charged using an external [[power supply]], which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2\u201424 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. The battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about {{convert|400|g|lb}} to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a [[smart battery]], a rechargeable [[battery pack]] with a built-in [[battery management system]] (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Cooling===\n[[Waste heat]] from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. Early laptops used [[heat sink]]s placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on [[heat pipe]]s to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. It is believed that some designs with metal cases, like Apple's aluminum [[MacBook Pro]] and [[MacBook Air]], also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink, allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.\n\n===Docking station===\n[[Image:Docking station 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Docking station and laptop]]\n\nA [[docking station]] (sometimes referred to simply as a ''dock'') is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports, and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to \"[[Road warrior (computing)|road warrior]]\" employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a [[Docking station#Port replicator|port replicator]]. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through [[USB]] or [[IEEE 1394|FireWire]].\n\n===Charging trolleys===\n[[Laptop charging trolley]]s, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple [[laptops]], [[netbooks]], and [[tablet computer]]s at the same time. The trolleys are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs<ref name=\"doug\">{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Dough|title=Getting rid of the ICT suite|url=http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006051528/http://dougwoods.co.uk/blog/getting-rid-of-the-ict-suite/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2010|work=Blog}}</ref> suites of desktop equipped with \"tower\" computers, but do not have enough plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices.

Schools, especially those with [[open plan]] designs, are often prime targets for [[thieves]] who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest\u2013value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop\u2013charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.<ref name=\"doug\" />\n\n===Solar panels===\n{{main|Solar notebook}}\n\nIn some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Gavin|title=The SOLAR-POWERED Ubuntu laptop|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/07/ubuntu_solar_powered_laptop/|publisher=THE REGISTER|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> The [[One Laptop Per Child]] Initiative released the [[OLPC XO-1]] laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITHNbOrPQyM |title=OLPC XO laptop powered by a solar panel |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Presently, they are designing an [[OLPC XO-3]] laptop with these features.

Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of [[neoprene]], with sturdier ones made of [[LRPu|low-resilience polyurethane]]. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in [[ballistic nylon]] to provide some measure of [[waterproofing]]. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a [[laptop cooler]], a device which helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow. Some stores sell laptop pads which enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.\n\n===Changes in certain features===\n\nSome of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc.\n\nSome of the components of recent models of laptop reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires removal of its either top or bottom part, removal of motherboard, and returning them back.\n\n===Obsolete features===\n[[File:3Com modem - Ethernet PCMCIA in IBM 9547.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[modem]] [[PCMCIA]] card on an old ThinkPad]]\n\nFeatures that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in most current laptops include:\n* Reset (\"cold restart\") button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)\n* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop\n* [[Floppy disk drive]]\n* [[Serial port]]\n* [[Parallel port]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* Shared [[PS/2 port|PS/2]] input device port\n* [[VHS]] or [[8 mm video format|8mm]] VCR\n* [[IrDA]]\n* [[S-video]] port{{NoteTag|Unconfirmed if this exists in most recent models of laptops.}}\n* [[PC Card]] / [[PCMCIA]] slot\n* [[ExpressCard]] slot\n* [[CD Drive|CD/DVD Drives]] (starting with 2013 models)\n* [[VGA port]] (starting with 2013 models)\n\n==Comparison with desktops==\n\n===Advantages===\n[[File:Astrid Gruppefremvisning.jpg|thumb|A teacher using laptop as part of a workshop for school children]]\n[[File:Jimmy Wales accessing Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] using a laptop on a park bench]]\n\n'''Portability''' is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Should I buy a laptop or desktop? | publisher = IT Division&nbsp;\u2013 University of Wisconsin | date = 19 March 2008 | url = http://kb.wisc.edu/showroom/page.php?id=3044 | accessdate =27 November 2008 }}</ref> Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places\u2014not only at home and at the office, but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' locations or at a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their device from the living room to the dining room to the family room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:\n* '''Productivity''': Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks. For example, an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.\n* '''Immediacy''': Carrying a laptop means having instant access to information, including personal and work files. This allows better collaboration between coworkers or students, as a laptop can be flipped open to look at a report, document, spreadsheet, or presentation anytime and anywhere.\n* '''Up-to-date information''': If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others. There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CD-ROMs) or using synchronization software over the Internet, such as [[cloud computing]]. However, transporting a single laptop to both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.\n* '''Connectivity''': In the 2010s, a proliferation of [[Wi-Fi]] wireless networks and cellular broadband data services ([[HSDPA]], [[EVDO]] and others) in many urban centers, combined with near-ubiquitous Wi-Fi support by modern laptops{{NoteTag|Almost all laptops contain a Wi-Fi interface; broadband cellular devices are available widely as extension cards and USB devices, and also as internal cards in select models.}} meant that a laptop could now have easy [[Internet]] and local network connectivity while remaining mobile. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.<ref>{{cite news | title = Faster Wi-Fi Predicted for Colleges | newspaper = The Chronicle of Higher Education | author = Josh Fischman | date = 7 August 2008| url = http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3226/faster-wifi-predicted-for-colleges | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOther advantages of laptops:\n* '''Size''': Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.\n* '''Low power consumption''': Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20\u2013120 W, compared to 100\u2013800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus multiplying the potential savings, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).\n* '''Quiet''': Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.\n* '''Battery''': a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. A desktop PC needs an [[Uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) to handle short interruptions, blackouts, and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20\u201330 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.<ref>A sample line of UPS devices and on-battery power: {{cite web | title = Back-UPS RS | publisher = APC | url = http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=23 | accessdate = 27 November 2008 }}</ref>\n* '''All-in-One''': designed to be portable, most 2010-era laptops have all components integrated into the chassis (however, some small laptops may not have an internal CD/CDR/DVD drive, so an external drive needs to be used). For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop \"tower\" (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.\n\n===Disadvantages===\nCompared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:\n\n====Performance====\nWhile the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable, and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops, laptops remain more expensive than desktop PCs at the same performance level.<ref>In a comparison between laptop and desktop of equal cost, the desktop's System Benchmark Score was twice that of the laptop. {{cite web | title = What to Buy, a Notebook or Desktop PC? | publisher = Tom's Hardware | date = 11 June 2008 | url = http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/desktop-vs-notebook,1946-7.html | accessdate =28 November 2008}}</ref> The upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest-end desktops (especially \"workstation class\" machines with two processor sockets), and \"bleeding-edge\" features usually appear first in desktops and only then, as the underlying technology matures, are adapted to laptops.\n\nFor Internet browsing and typical office applications, where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input, even relatively low-end laptops (such as Netbooks) can be fast enough for some users.<ref>For example, a review of the [[MSI Wind Netbook]] says that \"''The device is rarely sluggish in general use. It renders Web pages quickly, launches most applications without becoming too bogged down and generally doesn't feel like it's a budget laptop.''\" {{cite web | last = Reid | first = Rory | title = MSI Wind Review | publisher = CNET Australia | date = 7 July 2008 | url = http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | accessdate = 28 November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081205092148/http://www.cnet.com.au/laptops/laptops/0,239035649,339289583,00.htm | archivedate = 5 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Most higher-end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high-resolution movie playback, some 3D gaming and video editing and encoding. However, laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with a higher-end database, maths, engineering, financial software, virtualization, etc. This is because laptops use the mobile versions of processors to conserve power, and these lag behind desktop chips when it comes to performance. Some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop CPUs for laptops.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/14/rock-delivers-bd-core-i7-equipped-xtreme-790-and-xtreme-840-ga/|title=Rock delivers BD / Core i7-equipped Xtreme 790 and Xtreme 840 gaming laptops|website=Engadget}}</ref>\n\n====Upgradeability====\nUpgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops, which are thoroughly standardized. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Optical drives and [[internal expansion card]]s may be upgraded if they follow an [[Technical standard|industry standard]], but all other internal components, including the motherboard, CPU and graphics, are not always intended to be upgradeable. [[Intel]], [[Asus]], [[Compal Electronics|Compal]], [[Quanta Computer|Quanta]] and some other laptop manufacturers have created the [[Common Building Block]] standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards. The reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic. There is no industry-wide standard [[Computer form factor|form factor]] for laptops; each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own [[Proprietary hardware|proprietary]] design and construction, with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs. Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SDD, RAM, Keyboard...) in order to reduce size and upgradeability prospects. Devices such as sound cards, network adapters, hard and optical drives, and numerous other peripherals are available, but these upgrades usually impair the laptop's portability, because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Ergonomics and health effects====\n\n=====Wrists=====\n[[Image:laptop-coaster.jpg|thumb|[[Laptop cooler]] (silver) under laptop (white), preventing heating of lap and improving laptop airflow]]\n\nProlonged use of laptops can cause [[repetitive strain injury]] because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices,.<ref>{{cite web| last = Toub| first = Allegra| title = Take It Easy on Those Keyboards| publisher = Backlight Resumes| date = 23 May 2017| url = http://blog.backlightresumes.com/take-it-easy-on-those-keyboards| accessdate = 23 May 2017}}</ref> Usage of separate, external [[ergonomic keyboard]]s and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.\n\n=====Neck and spine=====\nA laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a [[Docking station#Computer stands|computer stand]].\n\n=====Possible effect on fertility=====\nA study by [[State University of New York]] researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting [[sperm count]] at risk.

Components such as screen hinges, latches, [[DC connector|power jack]]s, and [[power cord]]s deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and may have to be replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, result in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops.

Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Geier|first=Eric|title=Zen and the Art of Laptop Maintenance|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260438/zen_and_the_art_of_laptop_maintenance.html|work=PC World|accessdate=25 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n===== Parts replacement =====\nOriginal external components are expensive and usually proprietary and non-interchangeable; other parts are inexpensive\u2014a power jack can cost a few dollars\u2014but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician. Other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separately from larger more expensive components. For example, the video display cable and the backlight power cable that pass through the lid hinges to connect the motherboard to the screen may eventually break from repeated opening and closing of the lid. These tiny cables usually cannot be purchased from the original manufacturer separate from the entire LCD panel, with the price of hundreds of dollars, although for popular models an aftermarket in pulled parts generally exists. The repair costs of a failed motherboard or LCD panel often exceeds the value of a used laptop. Parts can also be ordered from third party vendors.\n\n=====Heating and cooling=====\nLaptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a [[computer fan|fan]] and [[heat sink]] that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. A complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).\n\n===== Battery life =====\nBattery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours, depending on usage, configuration, and power management settings. Yet, as it ages, the battery's energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops (specifically ultrabooks) do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have its battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive.\n\n====Security and privacy====\n{{Main|Laptop theft}}\nBecause they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of travel bag, laptops are often [[laptop theft|stolen]]. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports.<ref>[http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/services/dell_lost_laptop_study.pdf], Ponemon Institute, Airport Insecurity: The Case of Lost Laptops, June 2008</ref> The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems ([[identity theft]], [[credit card fraud]], breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance. Most laptops have a [[Kensington security slot]], which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems and [[disk encryption software|third-party software]] offer [[disk encryption]] functionality, which renders the data on the laptop's [[hard drive]] unreadable without a [[key (cryptography)|key]] or a passphrase. As of 2015, some laptops also have additional security elements added, including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.laptop-security-pro.com/biometric-devices.html|title= Secure File Sharing|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= Biometric Devices and Laptop Security|publisher= Laptop Security Pro|accessdate= 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nSoftware such as LoJack for Laptops, Laptop Cop, and GadgetTrack have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptop in the event of theft. Setting one's laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterwards), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186235/how-to-secure-your-computer-with-a-bios-or-uefi-password/|title=How to Secure Your Computer With a BIOS or UEFI Password|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/186881/hard-disk-passwords-explained-should-you-set-one-to-secure-your-files/|title=Hard Disk Passwords Explained: Should You Set One to Secure Your Files?|first=Chris|last=Hoffman|website=How-To Geek}}</ref> Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them,<ref>[http://www.intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html#.UP2bUFSzBJN#ixzz2Ucm2oKSg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606040557/http://intelligenceinsoftware.com/feature/it_software_strategy/lost_laptop/index.html|date=6 June 2013}}, Ponemon Institute, The Billion Dollar Lost Laptop Problem, September 2010</ref> however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery.

Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box.\nThe major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and [[Original design manufacturer|ODMs]]. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops ([[Alienware]]), high-performance laptops ([[HP Envy]]), netbooks ([[EeePC]]) and laptops for children ([[One Laptop per Child|OLPC]]).\n\nMany brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops.

Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health risk and toxic environment damage, were so strong, that the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ([[Epargyreus clarus|EPA]]) has outlawed [[landfill]] dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.\n\nMost laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing ([[Demanufacture]]), this involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newtechrecycling.com/where_to_recycle/business_laptops/what_to_do_with_used_office_laptops.html|title=Laptop Disposal Ewaste Recycling and IT asset disposition (ITAD)|last=Recycling|first=Newtech|website=www.newtechrecycling.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>  These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.\n\nCorporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction.  The data destruction process ensures that all information or data that has been stored on a laptops hard drive can never be retrieved again.

At about 8:30&nbsp;p.m., 15 officers surrounded the building and 12 others entered; nine of these went to the three-room apartment of Davis's sister Regina Lewis and seven entered it. Inside were Davis, his girlfriend, his sister, her husband, and four children. Lewis's two infant children were asleep in the bedroom at the rear.<ref name=\"NYT_1986-11-21\"/>\n\nInterviewed the next day, Regina Lewis reportedly once she answered a door knock, the police entered the living room with guns drawn, ordered the adults to get the children out, and called, \"Come out, Larry, you don't have a chance\u2014we've got you surrounded.\" At trial, the police alleged that Davis had fired first. The jury believed the events presented by the defense, in which an officer entered the apartment with a shotgun and fired at Davis, while he was seated behind a desk holding his baby. The officer, thinking he had hit Davis, was then shot in the neck by Davis with a handgun. The police took cover, returning fire as they retreated. In the confusion, no one kept track of Davis, who slipped into his other sister's apartment and escaped out a back window. Lewis had complained to her brother about him bringing guns to the apartment and told him to get out; he did leave but returned. She also quoted him as telling her, \"If I'm caught in the street, the police are going to shoot me.

They surrounded the 14-story building, closed off local streets and posted sharpshooters on nearby rooftops. After searching his sister's second-floor apartment, police began a systematic canvass of all 312 units. At some point during the day, Mr. Davis forced his way at gunpoint into Apartment 14-EB, where Elroy and Sophia Sewer lived with their two daughters, just as neighbor Theresa Ali, and her 2-year-old son, arrived for a visit. Mr. Sewer arrived home at 8 P.M. to find his family and the neighbors being held hostage by Mr. Davis. At 11:45&nbsp;p.m. Davis released the two visitors and sent Mr. Sewer out to pick up food from a nearby Chinese restaurant. He also ordered Mr. Sewer to call Mr. Davis' mother's and sister's tapped telephones and give false location information. When the husband returned with the food he was stopped for questioning by the police and, at 12:45&nbsp;a.m., informed them that his wife and two daughters were being held hostage by Mr. Davis.<ref name= \"NYT_1986-12-07cornered\"/>\n\nPolice set up a command post in a nearby apartment and by 1:30&nbsp;a.m. had established telephone contact. At one point Davis threatened to kill the hostages with a hand grenade, at other points he chatted with negotiators about stereo equipment, asked about a lawyer, and showed concern for his own safety, saying that he was afraid police would harm him.

At about 7 a.m. Larry Davis laid down his .45-caliber pistol and surrendered. As he was taken from the building in handcuffs, residents leaned out of their windows, clapped, and chanted Davis's name.<ref name= \"NYT_1986-12-07cornered\"/>\n\n==Murder and murder-attempt trials==\nThe [[Bronx District Attorney]], along with the District Attorney in Manhattan and in Long Island, had many charges against Larry Davis. They included weapons possession, murder of drug dealers, attempted murder of police, kidnapping, and automobile theft.\n\nDespite three trials in two years, prosecutors were unable to convince a jury of that Larry Davis was guilty for any but the weapons charge\u2014the ones he used in shooting the police officers\u2014until a jury convicted him and his brother, Eddie Davis, in the August 1986 killing of a drug dealer.\n\n===Four, Bronx drug dealers: March 1988 acquittal===\nThe four killings occurred in October 1986.\n\nThe prosecution, contending that Davis was a crack dealer who specialized in the armed robbery of rival crack dealers, called over 50 witnesses, encompassing ballistic evidence and fingerprints on a cash box placing Davis at the crime scene.\n\nDavis's attorneys [[William Kunstler]] and [[Lynne Stewart]], in their opening and closing arguments, contended that the prosecution's evidence was fabricated, framing Davis to excuse the infamous raid. They contended Davis had been recruited into a drug ring by rogue police officers, aiming to kill him in the raid.\n\nThe jury found conflicting testimony from witnesses, and discrepancies in times stated by prosecution witnesses.

But a 12-gauge shotgun slug was embedded in the bedroom's dresser drawer.\n\nThe defense implicated that McCarren, carrying a shotgun, had firing first, missing Davis but putting the slug in the dresser drawer.

In the 1930s, a further cutoff was built in southeastern Connecticut and southwestern Rhode Island, joining [[Old Mystic, Connecticut]] to Route 3 in [[Hopkinton, Rhode Island]]. The existing [[Route 84 (Connecticut)|Route 84]] in Connecticut was rerouted to use the new road (now [[Route 184 (Connecticut)|Route 184]]), and the short piece in Rhode Island was also numbered '''Route 84'''.<ref name=\"kurumi 184\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ctx180.html#d_184_route|title=kurumi: Connecticut Route 184|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> (This alignment had been the [[Hopkinton and Richmond Turnpike]] \u2013 better known as the [[New London Turnpike]] \u2013 but had fallen into disrepair.) The right of way of New London Turnpike goes through the Big River Management Area (as a dirt road), crosses Division Road as a four-way intersection with the north side of the turnpike paved, has an interchange with Interstate 95 (exit 7), continues for 1.85 miles before connecting with Route 3 in West Warwick for a \u00bc mile. New London Turnpike turns into New London Ave and continues straight for 2\u00bc miles before connecting with Providence street (RI-33). It follows Providence Street until it hits the Meshanticut Interchange.\n\nThe first section of what is now I-95 was planned as an upgrade and relocation of Route 84 and [[Route 3 (RI)|Route 3]] from the state line north of [[Westerly (RI)|Westerly]] to existing Route 3 of [[Richmond, Rhode Island|Richmond]]. The short Route 84 was widened to a four-lane divided road with one intersection at Gray Lane.

According to Rhode Island Department of Transportation blueprints, the highway was originally planned for the west side of Pawtucket, avoiding the Pawtucket River. The highway was originally designed to be constructed east of the New York\u2013New Haven railroad tracks and create underpasses on Mineral Spring Avenue, Broad Street, and Dexter Street. The highway was meant to travel east of the Pawtucket\u2013Central Falls train station and into South Attleboro, Massachusetts.{{cn|date=January 2016}}<!--{Pawtucket Times, Providence Journal, Rhode Island Department of Transportation.}-->\n\nThe [[Pawtucket River Bridge]] is part of Interstate 95 and has been replaced.\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers are sequential, but are planned be replaced with mileage-based numbering by 2020 as per [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|federal highway standards]].<ref>http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20171004/rhode-island-set-to-renumber-all-highway-exits</ref>\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"google maps\">{{google maps |url=https://goo.gl/maps/J7nNRSd7VPH2 |title=Interstate 95 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}</ref>|exit_ref=<ref name=\"exit numbers\">{{cite map |title=2014 Interstate Strip Map |url=http://www.dot.ri.gov/documents/maps/Interstate_Strip_Map.PDF |date=March 2014 |publisher=[[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]] |access-date=February 5, 2016}}</ref>|dest_ref=<ref name=\"google maps\"/>}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|county=Washington\n|cspan=7\n|location=Hopkinton\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.0\n|exit=\u2014\n|road={{jct|state=CT|I|95|dir1=south}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[Connecticut]]\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=0.7\n|exit=1\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|3|city1=Hopkinton|city2=Westerly}}\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=4.5\n|exit=2\n|road=[[Hope Valley, Rhode Island|Hope Valley]], [[Alton, Rhode Island|Alton]]\n|notes=Via Woodville Alton Road\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|location=Richmond\n|lspan=4\n|mile=6.4\n|place=Rest area and welcome center (northbound)\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=7.1\n|mile2=7.5\n|exit=3\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|138|city1=South Kingstown|city2=Wyoming}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 3A (east) and 3B (west)\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=9.0\n|exit=4\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|3|RI|165|to2=yes|city1=Arcadia|city2=Exeter}}\n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=10.7\n|place=Parking area and weigh station\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|county=Kent\n|cspan=13\n|location=West Greenwich\n|lspan=4\n|mile=13.6\n|mile2=14.3\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|102|city1=North Kingstown|city2=West Greenwich|city3=Glocester|city4=Exeter}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 5A (south) and 5B (north)\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=17.9\n|mile2=18.4\n|exit=6\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|3|city1=Coventry|city2=West Greenwich}}\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=19.6\n|mile2=20.1\n|exit=6A\n|road=Hopkins Hill Road\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=21.4\n|exit=7\n|road=[[Coventry, Rhode Island|Coventry]], [[West Warwick, Rhode Island|West Warwick]]\n|notes=Access via [[New London Turnpike]]\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|location=Warwick\n|lspan=9\n|mile=23.7\n|mile2=24.1\n|exit=8\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|2|RI|4|to2=yes|city1=East Greenwich|city2=West Warwick}}\n|notes=No northbound entrance; signed as exits 8A (south) and 8B (north) northbound\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=24.8\n|exit=9\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|4|dir1=south|city1=North Kingstown}}\n|notes=Southbound exit and northbound entrance; northern terminus of Route 4\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=26.6\n|mile2=27.2\n|exit=10\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|117|city1=West Warwick|city2=Warwick}}\n|notes=Signed as exits 10A (east) and 10B (west) southbound\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=27.6\n|exit=11\n|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=RI|I|295|dir1=north|city1=Woonsocket}}\n|notes=Southbound exit is via exit 12B; southern terminus of I-295\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=28.0\n|exit=12\n|espan=2\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|113|dir1=east|RI|5|to2=yes|city1=Warwick}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 12A southbound\n}}\n{{RIint\n|mile=28.5\n|road={{jct|state=RI|RI|113|dir1=west|I|295|dir2=north|RI|2|to3=yes|city1=West Warwick}}\n|notes=Signed as exit 12B southbound\n}}\n{{RIint|exit\n|mile=29.2\n|mile2=29.8\n|exit=13\n|road={{jct|state=RI|US|1|city1=T.F.

While obtaining a patent on a naturally occurring organism as previously known or used is not possible, patents may be taken out on specific chemicals isolated or developed from plants. Often these patents are obtained with a stated and researched use of those chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Generally the existence, structure and synthesis of those compounds is not a part of the indigenous medical knowledge that led researchers to analyze the plant in the first place. As a result, even if the indigenous medical knowledge is taken as prior art, that knowledge does not by itself make the active chemical compound \"obvious,\" which is the standard applied under patent law.\n\nIn the [[United States]], [[patent law]] can be used to protect \"isolated and purified\" compounds \u2013 even, in one instance, a new chemical element (see USP 3,156,523).  In 1873, [[Louis Pasteur]] patented a \"yeast\" which was \"free from disease\" (patent #141072).  Patents covering biological inventions have been treated similarly.  In the 1980 case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld a patent on a bacterium that had been genetically modified to consume petroleum, reasoning that U.S. law permits patents on \"anything under the sun that is made by man.\"  The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) has observed that \"a patent on a gene covers the isolated and purified gene but does not cover the gene as it occurs in nature\".<ref>{{Citation |title=Department of Commerce: United States Patent and Trademark Office [Docket No. 991027289-0263-02] RIN |work=Federal Register: Notices |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1092\u20131099 |publisher=Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and Records Administration |date=2001-01-05 |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/utilexmguide.pdf |access-date=2013-11-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224105437/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/utilexmguide.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-24 }}</ref>\n\nAlso possible under US law is patenting a [[cultivar]], a new variety of an existing organism.

While obtaining a patent on a naturally occurring organism as previously known or used is not possible, patents may be taken out on specific chemicals isolated or developed from plants. Often these patents are obtained with a stated and researched use of those chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Generally the existence, structure and synthesis of those compounds is not a part of the indigenous medical knowledge that led researchers to analyze the plant in the first place. As a result, even if the indigenous medical knowledge is taken as prior art, that knowledge does not by itself make the active chemical compound \"obvious,\" which is the standard applied under patent law.\n\nIn the [[United States]], [[patent law]] can be used to protect \"isolated and purified\" compounds \u2013 even, in one instance, a new chemical element (see USP 3,156,523).  In 1873, [[Louis Pasteur]] patented a \"yeast\" which was \"free from disease\" (patent #141072).  Patents covering biological inventions have been treated similarly.  In the 1980 case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld a patent on a bacterium that had been genetically modified to consume petroleum, reasoning that U.S. law permits patents on \"anything under the sun that is made by man.\"  The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) has observed that \"a patent on a gene covers the isolated and purified gene but does not cover the gene as it occurs in nature\".<ref>{{Citation |title=Department of Commerce: United States Patent and Trademark Office [Docket No. 991027289-0263-02] RIN |work=Federal Register: Notices |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1092\u20131099 |publisher=Office of the Federal Register of the National Archives and Records Administration |date=2001-01-05 |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/utilexmguide.pdf |access-date=2013-11-04 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224105437/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/sol/notices/utilexmguide.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-24 }}</ref>\n\nAlso possible under US law is patenting a [[cultivar]], a new variety of an existing organism.

It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke) |Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table. \n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]].

While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death, but at the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas, as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth. After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. \n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father God asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film.

They released a statement, calling it <blockquote>one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in 25 years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.\n\nThe film has been controversial and received largely polarized reviews, with some critics calling the film a religious classic while others found the extreme violence distracting and excessive, and claimed that the film promoted [[antisemitism]].<ref name=EW /><ref name=tomatoes >{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_of_the_christ/|title=''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004)|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref name=metacritic>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/passionofthechrist|title= ''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004): reviews|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The film grossed over $622 million worldwide<ref name=\"POTC TN\"/> and became the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|seventh-highest-grossing film]] domestically at the end of its theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It is currently the highest-grossing [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> It received three nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2005, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=Mel|title=The Passion of the Christ|date=February 25, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late hours of the night at the forested garden of Gethsemane, at the height of his cause, Jesus prays while his disciples Saint Peter, James, son of Zebedee James, and John the Evangelist sleep. While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death, but at the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas, as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth. After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. \n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father God asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr.

The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\", in Latin and Hebrew.

This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

They shared common arms, procedures, tactics, organization and personnel with PAVN.]]\n\n'''NLF and PAVN battle tactics''' comprised a flexible mix of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[conventional warfare]] battle tactics used by the Main Force of the People's Liberation Armed Forces (known as the National Liberation Front or [[Viet Cong]] in the West) and the [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] (People's Army-Vietnam) to defeat their [[United States Armed Forces|U.S.]] and South Vietnamese (GVN/[[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]) opponents during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Arnold R. Isaacs. 1998. Without Honor: Defeat in Vietnam and Cambodia</ref>\n\nThe NLF was an umbrella of front groups to conduct the insurgency in [[South Vietnam]]. The NLF was affiliated with independent groups and sympathizers. The armed wing of the NLF was regional and local guerrillas, and the People's Liberation Armed Forces ([[Viet Cong#Names|PLAF]]). The PLAF was the \"Main Force\" \u2013 the ''Chu Luc'' full-time soldiers of the NLF's military muscle. Many histories lump both the NLF and the armed wing under the term \"Viet Cong\" in common usage. Both were tightly interwoven and were in turn controlled by the North.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}<ref>Stanley Karnow, Vietnam: A History, (Viking Press: 1983)</ref>{{rp|12\u2013239|date=November 2012}} Others consider the Viet Cong to primarily refer to the armed elements.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\">Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg, Inside the VC and the NVA, (Ballantine Books, 1993), pp. 33\u201356</ref> The term [[Vietnam People's Army|PAVN]] (People's Army of Vietnam) identifies regular troops of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).

Such initiative was sometimes blunted by ARVN countermeasures, or the aggressive \"[[search and destroy]]\" tactics of US forces under Gen. [[William Westmoreland]], and the improved pacification measures of his successor Gen. [[Creighton Abrams]]. Nevertheless, over the vast area that was South Vietnam, [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], Communist forces typically held the initiative in a conflict extending over a decade. One US military study for example found that 88 percent of all engagements against US forces were initiated by the enemy.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\">Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., The Army and Vietnam [Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986]</ref>{{rp|188\u2013192|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere were generally two approaches to metering losses. The first was [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] \u2013 operations were conducted to inflict maximum losses on ARVN/US forces. This meant expending lives and resources in attacks (ambushes, raids etc.) or in defensive operations (digging in to fight, bleeding opponents and then withdrawing when enemy forces grew too strong). Attacks were scaled up or down depending on a myriad of factors including the political situation in a particular area.<ref>Gen W. C. Westmoreland, \"Report on Operations in South Vietnam, January 1964 \u2013 June 1968,\" in Report on the War in Vietnam [As of 30 June 1968], by United States Pacific Command [Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1969], appendix L, 284.</ref> The second approach was avoidance of battle unless numerical superiority and chances of success were good. In the Vietnam War, most Communist units (including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics) spent only a limited number of days a year fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an ARVN/US action, most of the time was spent in population control, training, intelligence gathering, propaganda indoctrination or construction of [[fortification]]s, with Communist troops typically only fighting an average of 1 day in 30.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> In essence, the VC/NVA largely fought on the ground only when they wanted to fight.\n\nMastery of the initiative made the US attrition strategy of seeking big battles problematic, and also undermined GVN/ARVN attempts at pacification. Manpower losses could always be made up with more infiltration of regulars from the North and additional recruitment of VC within the South. The arrival of US forces in 1965 saw a shift back to small unit and guerrilla warfare. The average of [[battalion]] sized attacks for example dropped from 9.7 per month to 1.3, while small-scale actions climbed by 150 percent.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> While US troops were being lured to remote regions in pursuit of base areas, big battles and large [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] ratios, 90% of all attacks were consistently occurring in the 10 percent of the country that held over 80 percent of the population according to one American study covering 1966 and 1967. The US strategy thus not only failed to fully come to grips with an elusive enemy on the outer edges, but also failed to consistently keep them away from the inner populated areas as well.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />\n\n===Learning and adaptability===\n[[File:PAVNcriticism.jpg|left|thumb|Criticism and self-criticism sessions and continuous study helped communist forces effectively adapt lessons learned on the battlefield]]\n\nThe VC/NVA battle philosophy placed great stress on learning and adaptability, and systematically strived to improve battle techniques at the lowest levels. Units and individuals were expected to be problem solvers, making creative use out of what might be fleeting opportunities and scarce resources. After engagements, detailed after-action reports were conducted, and detailed analyses of various problems in the field were carried out. After an action, both individuals and units examined their performance through widespread \"criticism and self-criticism\" sessions, and even commanders were taken to task at the appropriate levels. The lessons learned were continually incorporated into NVA/VC operations. Experiments were also carried out by different units, and the results were disseminated via conferences, field manuals, memoranda and new procedures.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\nThis capability to adapt was crucial when facing new [[technology]], such as US [[helicopters]]. Several studies were conducted on how to combat the menace from above, and aiming and firing procedures were worked out for a variety of weapons, such as heavy [[machine guns]]. In one Viet Cong publication, shooting 1\u00bd lengths ahead of the aircraft was deemed satisfactory for striking vital engine parts.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }} Firing tables were also constructed and disseminated for different types of US aircraft. Countermeasures, including use of trenches and mines were also published for such armored vehicles as the [[M113 armored personnel carrier]], which was often devastating to VC formations when first introduced.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\nThe NVA/VC forces did not only study the technology of their enemies but their operations as well, looking for weaknesses to exploit. American activities were sometimes left unmolested so vulnerable patterns could be identified and analyzed. American \"surround and pound\" tactics for example could sometimes be predictable. At the Battle of Ong Thanh for example, heavy American airstrikes were called in to hit a bunker complex, which was then predictably followed by US \"mop up\" operations the next day. The American \"mop up\" forces fell into a deadly prepared ambush, with Viet Cong fighters inflicting heavy casualties.<ref>MacGarrigle, George L. (1998). Combat Operations: Taking the Offensive: October 1966 to October 1067. Washington D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History. p. 350-357</ref> Excessively hovering helicopters were also a tip-off as to possible landing zones. Taking predictable routes and trails also opened up ARVN/American opponents to casualties via booby traps, mines and ambushes. American air strikes were sometimes ground-marked several minutes in advance, giving People's Army units enough time to evacuate an area or prepare for ambushes. American smoke marking practices were also studied, and communist troops sometimes became adept at imitating the color-coded smoke grenades the Americans used to signal air strikes or helicopter landings.<ref>James E. Westheider. 2007. The Vietnam War. pp 146\u2013152</ref> This intensive study and exploitation never ceased, and lessons learned were disseminated to other PAVN/VC formations.\n\n===Mobility and movement===\n[[File:Vccampnetwork.jpg|thumb|left|VC camp and movement network in one SVN district, 1966\u201367.]]\n\n====Movement and area control====\nThe VC/NVA were constantly on the move, seldom staying more than 2\u20134 days in one place. Integral to mobility was elaborate camouflage and information denial procedures, such as restricting civilian movements prior to, or during an operation. Frequent rotation involved [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacking]] in a series of fortified camps. These fortified sites could also be within villages or their subsidiary hamlets.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}\n\nConstant shuttling between camps or \"nomading,\" allowed the VC and NVA to evade detection and defend themselves. Just as important however, it allowed them to control an area's people, food and other material.<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND \u2013 VIETNAM, Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, (San Francisco, JUNE 1966), pp. 1\u201324</ref> As noted above, Main Force VC and NVA typically spent only a small number of days a year fighting. Most of the time was spent in area control, which provided recruits, food and other resources. Control of an area was achieved because the moving VC/NVA formations generally kept within striking distance of the civilian population and were thus in a position to harvest intelligence, liquidate opposition, intimidate the reluctant, and enforce demands for taxes, labor and other resources.\n\nMovement procedures varied with enemy locations, terrain etc., but generally recon elements from battalions or companies met with local guerrillas or operatives to gain intelligence, map out the terrain ahead, and obtain guides as needed. Security was on a tight basis with soldiers only being informed at the last minute. A movement order was accompanied by a thorough cleanup of the area to hide traces of the unit. Trenches, foxholes and other [[fortification]]s were generally camouflaged for later reuse.\n\nOnce on the move, an advanced recon team preceded the main body. Behind the advance troops, came the combat units, Headquarters, heavy weapons, combat support soldiers and another combat element. Trailing the formation was a [[Rear guard|rearguard]] detachment. The distance between individual men was generally 5\u201310 meters \u2013 less during night movements. Complete radio silence was maintained during a movement, and strict camouflage and concealment procedures applied during day movement.\n\nRecon elements scouted the flanks and rear extensively, especially while crossing obstacles or in enemy-held areas. Most movement was at night. Integral to any movement into a camp was the use of multiple avenues of approach, avoiding predictable patterns that could be exploited by opposing forces. When making an approach march for a planned battle, a long, roundabout route was generally taken, often criss-crossing earlier movements to fool enemy surveillance.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 169\u2013190}}\n\n====Signaling and communications====\nCommunications relied heavily on field telephone and runner until the latter stages of the war when mostly conventional forces took the field. A simple signaling system via a series of gunshots was also used to communicate while moving in the jungle, with the pattern and sequence of the shots conveying meaning to other People's Army troops.<ref name=\"Prados\" /> When VC or NVA did acquire modern equipment via capture or supply, they made numerous attempts at communications deception, imitating US [[radio]] transmissions and call signs to lure US/ARVN helicopters and troops into ambushes, or redirecting artillery fire from themselves on to US/ARVN positions via bogus requests for artillery adjustment and support.<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM, \"Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No. 64: Imitative Communications Deception,\" (APO San Francisco), MAC J343 15 September 1967</ref>\n\n===Fortified camps===\n====Camp construction====\n[[File:vcnvabasecamp.jpg|thumb|right|Typical VC/NVA fortified camp. Source: US Army Platoon Leaders Handbook, 1967]]\n\nConstant movement often brought the VC fighters to vast camp networks, spread out over a wide area. Some of these movements required new construction. Others reoccupied old campsites abandoned temporarily, or prepared ahead of time as part of the movement rotation. Even brief stops whether in the field, jungle or village required digging of combat trenches and foxholes. Campsites had several characteristics:<ref name=\"US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam 1967 pp. 1\u201344\">US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" (US Army: October, 1967), pp. 1\u201344</ref>\n* Defense in depth\n* Extensive use of camouflage\n* Mutually supporting defensive networks\n* Restricted avenues of approach\n* Escape routes\n* Use of tunnels, bunkers, communication trenches and foxholes\n\nAlso important was the requirement that the chosen location be within a single night's march of another camp. Special attention was paid to avenues of approach and withdrawal. VC and NVA battalions moved independently within their own sectors and along their own routes. A typical battalion might rotate between 20 and 25 campsites, all within a nights march of 3\u20134 other camps. While a US or ARVN attack might force them to fight, the primary mission was area control.\n\nThe standard camp was roughly circular and consisted of 2-lines of fortification, incorporating individual fighting positions, bunkers and trenches. Semi-permanent or permanent base camps contained more elaborate fortification ([[Viet Cong and PAVN battle tactics#Defensive tactics|Defensive tactics]]). A typical VC/NVA battalion generally spread out its companies at one-hour intervals across an area, balancing the need for quick dispersal with opportunity to concentrate as needed.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=150\u2013168}}\n\nCamps were not necessarily in remote areas. They were often situated near hamlets, or even within them \u2013 with troops taking shelter in individual houses if the village was fully dominated by the guerilla forces. After digging in, telephone wire was run, units positioned and contact made with other surrounding [[military]] formations \u2013 especially [[militia]] and guerrilla fighters. These local units were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main Force element came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover. Mines and booby traps were also planted along likely avenues of approach.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\n====Camp life and morale====\n[[File:NguyenVanBe.jpg|thumb|upright|1966 NLF Poster celebrating dead hero Nguyen Van Be for killing many Americans. Be was actually a defector to the GVN who surfaced later in the year, astonished to read of his reputed exploits and death.<ref>Robert W. Chandler, War of Ideas \u2013 The U.S. Propaganda Campaign in Vietnam, A Westview Special Study, Boulder, CO, 1981</ref>]]\nLife in camp followed the military routines common to all armies, including early morning reveille, weapons training, building fortifications, duty details assigned individuals and groups, and daily strength and readiness reports required of officers. Typical of all communist armies, a large bloc of time was devoted to \"study sessions\" where troops were indoctrinated and \"criticism and self-criticism\" administered. The exploits of outstanding fighters against the enemy were widely publicized and men were urged to emulate them.\n\nFood supplies were, like those of other armies, designed to keep the troops at a certain level of activity rather than be tasty. VC/NVA fighters received a daily cash allowance for food which they might sometimes use in local markets. They also foraged widely including hunting. Lacking refrigeration, most food was prepared fresh. Rice was the staple. The ingenious [[Hoang Cam stove|''Hoang Cam'' stove]] was used to prepare meals without flame or smoke being detected, incorporating a long exhaust trench that allowed smoke to gradually disperse into the jungle far away from the actual stove.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 150\u2013168}}\n\nRecreation was provided by well organized troupes of actors and musicians when feasible, unit papers and radio broadcasts. As in all things, these were monitored by Party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] to ensure the proper line was disseminated. Medical care was difficult and austere in wartime conditions, and medicines and facilities lacking, nevertheless the highly organized system provided a rudimentary level of care to injured fighters, with field hospitals sometimes located in tunnels, caves and underground bunkers.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 150\u2013168}}\n\n===Defensive tactics===\nVC/NVA defensive doctrine generally stressed avoidance of extended battle. Unless an enemy sweep, or patrol provoked an engagement, communist forces generally lay low until they were ready to initiate their own actions. If an engagement ensued, the typical approach in terms of defense was to delay opposing forces and withdraw as soon as possible, while inflicting maximum casualties before withdrawal. Massive US \"search and destroy\" sweeps for example, while of unmistakable value in area denial, dispersal of opponents etc., yielded mixed results in the face of such avoidance tactics.\n\nThe biggest such operation, \"Operation Junction City\" in 1967 for example, involving some 22 US battalions and 4 ARVN counterparts, and supported by massive air and artillery firepower, only yielded an average of approximately 33 enemy dead per day, over its 2 months. Such losses were manageable by an opponent that could put tens of thousands of staunch fighters in the field, and reinforce them with more every day. Even more telling, such massive sweeps failed to cripple their targets and deliver the big battles sought by the Americans. The option of initiating contact was still largely in the hands of [[Communist]] units, and their tactics lured powerful US forces away from populated areas, their key base until late in the war.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|171\u2013192|date=November 2012}}\n\nA key part of the avoidance defensive pattern also involved the intensive use of fortifications and mines. Both served to enable Front forces to escape for another day's fighting, while running up the enemy tab in blood and treasure.<ref name=\"Rottman\">Gordan L. Rottman, Viet Cong and NVA Tunnels and Fortifications of the Vietnam War (Osprey: 2006) pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n\n====Defensive layouts: the two-belt system====\n[[File:Vcfortifications2.jpg|thumb|Detailed view of tunnel complex including facilities for medical care (far left)]]\n\nDefensive positions had to be prepared every time VC/NVA troops moved to a new destination, with an eye to the suitability of terrain, camouflage and withdrawal routes. Generally a two line system of fortifications was used, about 50\u2013200 meters apart. The lines were typically shaped like an L, U or V to enhance interlocking fields of fire. Individual L-shaped fighting positions were also dug, with bunkers at right angles covered with thick logs and about 2 feet of dirt. Shallow trenches connected many individual bunkers and positions into each belt of the 2-line system. The bunkers provided cover from inevitable US artillery and air attack, and the fighting positions allowed crossfire against infantry assaults. The second line of defense was not visible from the first line of positions, and allowed the fighters to fall back, either to escape a heavy bombardment, to continue retreating or to furnish a rallying point for counterattack.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nIn villages the VC and NVA followed the same 2-belt approach, placing defenses so they were integrated with village homes and structures. This took advantage of some US [[Rules of engagement|Rules of Engagement]] limiting or delaying the use of heavy weapons in inhabited areas. Another benefit of embedding defenses among civilians was that atrocities could be charged if civilian structures were hit by US or ARVN fire. Numerous dummy positions were also constructed to draw ARVN and American fire. In more remote areas, defensive fortifications were more elaborate, sometimes incorporating a third belt of defenses with stronger bunkers and trench systems. US attacks against such tough positions sought to avoid US casualties by relying upon firepower.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=33-56 }}\n\nIn some circumstances Front fortifications did not follow the layout scheme described above. Bunkers and fighting holes were scattered more widely to delay attackers, and create the psychological impression that they were surrounded on all sides. Lookout posts were often positioned on key trails, routes and likely US helicopter landing zones. To enhance their mobility during a defensive battle, numerous air-raid shelters, bunkers and trenches were pre-built in advance around an area of operations. This involved an enormous amount of labor but proved their value in maneuvering under ARVN/US attacks.<ref name=\"Rottman\" /> Foxholes dug by VC troops during the victorious [[Battle of Ap Bac]] are testimony to the insurgents almost religious dedication to field fortifications. The holes were dug so deep that a man could stand inside. Excavation of dirt was from the rear, hiding telltale traces of the digging. Only a direct hit by an artillery shell or bomb could kill troops inside such holes. Behind the line of foxholes, the Viet Cong utilized and improved an irrigation ditch, allowing them concealed movement, communication and transmission of supplies on foot or by sampan. Most of these fighting positions were invisible from the air.<ref>Mark Moyar. 2006. Triumph Forsaken: the Vietnam War, 1954\u20131965. Cambridge University press, 182\u2013277</ref>\n\n====Booby traps and mines====\n[[File:vcminemarkers2.jpg|thumb|right|VC 'scatter-site' mining and booby traps inflicted significant casualties. Typical marking methods for friendly forces included broken sticks, saplings or groups of pebbles<ref>from: US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" (US Army: October, 1967), p 26-30</ref>]]\n\nBooby traps and [[Land mine|mines]] caused immense psychological pressure on US and ARVN troops and also inflicted numerous casualties. By 1970 for example, some 11% of fatalities and 17% of injuries inflicted on US troops were caused by booby traps and mines.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=33-56 }} Identified by a variety of markers for friendly forces, these devices slowed operations, diverted resources towards security and clearance activity, damaged equipment and poisoned relations between soldiers and the surrounding civilian population.\n\n=====Booby traps=====\nBooby traps ranged from the simple to the complex. Non-explosive traps included the well-known sharpened [[Punji stick|''punji'' stake]] coated in excrement, and mounted on sapling triggers and placed in shallow, covered pits. Stakes were deployed where infantry would walk or fling themselves to avoid attack such as roadside trenches, or behind logs. One of these devices was to injure a future Chairman of the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] \u2013 [[Colin Powell]].<ref>Karen De Young, Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell, (Alfred Knopf: 2006), pp. 60\u201375</ref> Another type of trap was a spiked mud ball that swung down on its victim after a trip wire release, impaling him. Other impalement devices included bamboo whips and triggered sapling spikes. Bows with poisoned arrows were also used.\n\nExplosive booby traps were also employed, some command detonated by hidden observers. They ranged from single bullet [[Cartridge Trap|cartridge traps]], to grenades, to dud bombs and shells. Anti-vehicle traps ranged from mines to buried artillery rounds. Helicopter traps were often deployed in trees surrounding a potential landing zone, triggered by an observer, or the rotor's wash. Booby traps were also made from American and ARVN trash in the field. Discarded ration cans, for example, were loaded with grenades that had pins pulled partially \u2013 the other end connected to tripwire. The sides of the can held the pin in place until the tripwire was activated. Discarded batteries and communications wire was also used \u2013 the batteries hooked to the waste wire, providing an ignition current to spark the charge of dud or discarded mortar/artillery rounds.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 33-56}}\n\n=====Mines: the VC substitute for artillery=====\nMines caused even more damage than booby traps. According to one US Army history:\n\n\"The enemy employed \"nuisance mining,\" that is, scattering mines throughout an area rather than in well-defined minefields, on a scale never before encountered by U.S. forces. Mines and booby traps were usually installed at night by trained personnel who had detailed knowledge of the terrain. Through ingenious techniques in mine warfare, the Viet Cong successfully substituted mines and booby traps for artillery.\n\n<blockquote>Instead of conventional [[minefield]]s covered by fire, the enemy hindered or prevented the use of supply roads and inhibited off-the-road operations by planting explosive devices in indiscriminate patterns. While he benefited directly by causing combat casualties, vehicle losses and delays in tactical operations, equally important was the psychological effect. Just the knowledge that a mine or booby trap could be placed anywhere slowed combat operations and forced allied troops to clear almost the entire Vietnam road net every day.<ref>{{cite |first= Lieutenant General John H (Jr) |last=Hay |title=Tactical and Materiel Innovations CMH Pub 90-21 |series=US Army, Vietnam Studies |publisher=Department of Army |location= Washington D.C. |year=2003 |origyear=1974 |url= https://history.army.mil/html/books/090/90-21/index.html <!-- |LoC=72-600390 --> |page={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Hugging techniques, timings, counterattacks and withdrawals====\n[[File:Pavnattack.jpg|thumb|NVA troops 1967]]\nThe VC/NVA fighters sought to neutralize US and ARVN firepower by \"hugging\" enemy troops (Vietnamese: ''N\u1eafm th\u1eaft l\u01b0ng \u0111\u1ecbch m\u00e0 \u0111\u00e1nh'')\u2014fighting so close that artillery or aircraft strikes had to be restrained for fear of friendly fire casualties.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfZLePtF_uk&index=4&list=PLaB7EsZA6jvcYKVhtS_HOOX2F1g7VsbD5&t=0s|title=The Vietnam War, Episode Three: The River Styx (January 1964 \u2013 December 1965)|publisher=PBS|time=1:44:35 | access-date = 2018-09-08}}</ref> This tactic was created by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh]]<ref>{{Ch\u00fa th\u00edch web|url=http://tapchiqptd.vn/vi/tim-hieu-truyen-thong-quan-su/su-sang-tao-trong-tu-duy-quan-su-cua-dai-tuong-nguyen-chi-thanh/9760.html|title=S\u1ef1 s\u00e1ng t\u1ea1o trong t\u01b0 duy qu\u00e2n s\u1ef1 c\u1ee7a \u0110\u1ea1i t\u01b0\u1edbng Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh | access-date = 2018-09-08}}</ref> after the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] in November 1965. Vigorous counterattacks were also made, particularly against weaker ARVN formations. Typically, VC/NVA troops in a defensive or ambush position held their fire or maneuvered until US troops were very close before opening fire. This initiated the \"hug\" method. Since their enemies would generally draw back upon contact and rely on supporting fires, front troops moved with them, \"hanging on the belt.\"<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nActions against enemy forces were often initiated in the latter part of the day, with impending nightfall providing favorable conditions for withdrawal. When surrounded, the Main Force VC and especially the NVA fought tenaciously, but usually with an eye towards withdrawal. Great efforts were made in recovering bodies, a psychological warfare measure that denied opponents the satisfaction of viewing enemy dead.\n\nInvariably, VC and NVA units sought to withdraw if conditions were unfavorable, and camps and base areas were abandoned without sentiment if they became untenable. Rearguard detachments, mined routes, and diversionary attacks formed part of the retreat. The existence of cross-border sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam, where US ground troops could not follow greatly aided safe withdrawal of Communist formations.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nThere was a withdrawal scheme for all operations whether defensive or offensive. Escape and exit routes were pre-planned and concealed in advance, with later regrouping at a planned assembly point. Common techniques for withdrawal included the following:<ref>US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics\", (US Army: October, 1967), p 1-44</ref>\n* Fragmenting\u2014splitting up in small groups when under attack, especially when trying to break through an encirclement.\n* Dispersing\u2014generally used when discovered. VC/NVA troops disperse, sometimes dropping packs to delay enemy forces who stop to inspect them.\n* Hiding\u2014VC/NVA troops spent a massive amount of time constructing fortifications and hiding places. Withdrawal movements frequently utilized these hideouts, often deep tunnel networks.\n* Deceiving\u2014conducting diversionary attacks to deceive and draw away enemy forces and thus facilitate the withdrawal.\n* Delaying\u2014use of rearguard units to delay pursuing forces. Delay units were sometimes used to set up enemy forces for an ambush, where the pursued turned on their pursuers.\n\n====Defensive measures against US aircraft====\nWhile their American opponents enjoyed air superiority, PAVN forces continuously challenged them, deploying an impressive array of ordnance to liquidate enemies from the air. The sophisticated missile defense system built with Soviet and Chinese assistance is well known, but PAVN made extensive use of anti-aircraft guns and even volume firing by ordinary soldiers. At the lowest level, one study noted that PAVN gunners were trained to use small arms against all types of aircraft, and special firing cells were established that could shoot up to 1000 rounds in 3 to 5 seconds at fast-moving jets. The volume of such firepower made life hazardous at the low levels for US planes, forcing them to move to higher altitudes, where the specialized anti-aircraft cannon took over. Special \"bait\" areas, ringed with hidden anti-craft batteries were also established to lure US aircraft. Barrage firing of many guns, mixed at various levels was also sometimes effective. Sensitive areas, such as Hanoi, were the most heavily defended. Most US aircraft losses were caused by heavy automatic weapons and 14mm, 35mm 57mm and 85mm anti-aircraft guns. Flak batteries forced some US aircraft even higher, where they would be within reach of the deadly SA-2 missile batteries. Positioning automatic weapons at treetop level also aided in the struggle against US helicopters. Air losses were to cause a dip in the morale of American pilots, some of whom felt they were being called to risk their lives against targets of relatively little value. Appeals to US Defense Secretary McNamara to remove restrictions on more lucrative targets were often drastically pared down or vetoed. The inability of US airpower to take a decisive toll on communist forces is testimony not only to US failures, but to the tenacity of the ordinary PAVN soldier in direct combat with aerial enemies and in the massive effort spent in constructing sophisticated fortifications and tunnel systems.<ref>JACOB VAN STAAVEREN. 2002.

When surrounded by superior air-mobile forces communist troops often fought delaying actions until nightfall, facilitating a breakout in the darkness. Special units were sometimes tasked to probe US encirclements for weak spots.]]\nUS forces sometimes employed sophisticated airmobile tactics, using integrated helicopter landings, artillery support, and troop insertions to surround enemy contacts and close off escape routes. The outstanding mobility of the helicopter made this possible, and these versatile machines could be sent into action in several configurations (troop transport, gunship, med-evac, heavy lift and supply). Helicopters allowed transport and deployment of infantry, artillery, medical, and supply elements to almost any location, presenting a formidable instrument that enhanced American and ARVN operations. When combined with other aerial elements such as fixed wing air support this combat power was multiplied, and opened up a whole new dimension of operational maneuver.<ref>Ira A Hunt, 2004. Ninth Infantry Division In Vietnam, p. 61-78</ref> But helicopters also had several vulnerabilities. They required a vast and expensive \"logistical tail\" of maintenance, fuel, munitions and bases. No nation except the US could afford such expense- fielding some 12,000 machines in Vietnam, almost half of which were shot down or lost due to accidents.<ref>Martin Van Creveld. 2011. The Age of Airpower, 379-400N</ref> The ability of helicopters to move men and material anywhere was impressive but also meant US and ARVN troops in some instances were heavily dependent on them. Destruction of the helicopter lifeline could derail an operation or maneuver, and the need to air-transport men and material to remote locations meant every new arrival of medevac, supply, transport or troop flights gave the VC/NVA yet ''another'' opportunity to cripple missions and machines. Helicopters were also very vulnerable to heavy machine guns, light AA artillery, portable SAMs like the Soviet Strela, and even concentrated small arms fire. According to some historians of airpower (Van Creveld 2011), costs were sometimes not commensurate with gains, and US airmobile operations might boil down to hugely expensive machines and their support systems chasing a handful of teenagers or second-string militiamen armed with cheap rifles.<ref>Martin Van Creveld. 2011. The Age of Airpower, 379\u2013400</ref>\n\n=====Anti-guerrilla sweeps in populated areas=====\nDuring anti-guerrilla sweeps, by some US units like the Ninth Infantry Division, contact was first established with VC/NVA forces via air or foot patrol, or planned raids on locations identified by intelligence sources. Usually conducted in daytime at the brigade level, planned strikes would allocate artillery and helicopter assets to battalions tasked with the fight. Artillery elements positioned firebases early to create an umbrella of steel over the proposed zone of battle. Helicopter assets were assigned and divided into 3 segments- light scout helicopters for reconnaissance, heavily armed gunships for firepower, and larger \"slicks\", or troop transports for the infantry. The force commander, sometimes in a helicopter, was in constant communication with all elements via rUHF, FM and field radio as needed.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\">Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61\u201365</ref>\n\nAs the American operation commenced, light scout helicopters flew ahead of the strike force at low level to detect opponents or draw their fire. Above the scouts, the helicopter gunships would lurk, ready to pounce on enemy movement, fire or fortifications. Behind and below the gunships came the \"slicks.\" These transport choppers would sometimes carry \"people sniffer\" technology designed to detect chemical traces or fumes left from human waste, smoke or sweat- indicators that Communist troops might be hiding nearby. People sniffing often required steady low altitude flying to improve reliability of results. Once VC/NVA were detected, hiding places might be saturated with tear gas. If flushed out, the enemy was attacked by the gunships, and the transports began to land infantry to surround the target and seal off escape routes. Artillery firebases would then begin their fires to smash the opposition, bombard exit routes and provide cover for the American infantry. US troops on such operations did not usually drive home attacks with direct assault, but sealed the enemy in a ring, while he was worked over by artillery and gunship strikes. Fixed-wing aircraft were on call if needed. This \"surround and pound\" approach substituted metal for men, and lowered US casualties, but in turn caused massive noncombatant civilian casualties.<ref>Christian G. Appy. 2016. American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity p. 178-183</ref>\n[[File:Helicopter airassault jitterbug.jpg|thumb|9th Infantry division troops on airmobile operation- 1969\u2013 Mekong Delta]]\nCommunist forces deployed several countermeasures against the American tactics. Avoidance and concealment was a primary method- sometimes made more difficult by the \"sniffer\" technology. But chemical detection was not always reliable- and could be thrown off by the use of animal decoys, urine bucket diversions, or was affected by wind, rain and other factors. VC/NVA units also built their fortifications in the high brush along canal banks and streams- providing a route of easier escape from the American attack. These locations could be a double-edged sword: they gave clear fields of fire against American infantry but the adjacent rice paddies sometimes created convenient enemy landing zones, and the water escape routes could become bottlenecks.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/> Pre-built fortifications and trenches helped shield the communist forces from annihilation as the ring closed in, and previously prepared ground, laced with booby-traps also delayed enemy forces. If there was enough advance warning, VC/NVA forces would prepare kill zones near or in likely landing spots. Trees could also make effective defensive positions. Booby traps were laid on trails and rice paddy dikes, and in jungle growth in a random pattern, and often caused multiple casualties to American troops.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/>\n\n[[File:Operation Dewey Canyon map.jpg|thumb|Fast-moving airmobile operations in Operation Dewey Canyon confronted NVA regulars.]]\nThe primary tactic after being surrounded was to delay until nightfall, after which breakouts would begin. Large formations were broken down into smaller units to facilitate escape and a rendezvous was pre-planned in advance. Special units were deployed to probe the encirclement, looking for weak points, and decoy units were held ready for action to occupy American forces once the breakouts began. Breakouts could be made with diversions while bodies of troops slipped away, or strength could be concentrated on a weak spot, providing enough local superiority to penetrate the American encirclement and disperse. Escaping units would link up later at designated marshaling points.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/> Harassment and diversionary tactics also paid dividends. As noted by some airpower historians, relatively small bodies of local fighters armed with inexpensive rifles, could divert and tie down expensive and massive allocations of men, material and time deployed by more sophisticated opponents.<ref>Van Creveld 379\u2013400</ref>\n\nIronically, the very efficiency and convenience of firebases, could at times aid VC/NVA forces. In some areas, US troops, often used as \"bait\" to draw out an enemy response, developed \"firebase psychosis\"- a reluctance to move too far away from the covering artillery of their firebases. As a result, combat movement and operational flexibility was hampered, and more mobile communist forces attacked, broke contact, maneuvered around and eluded their opponents. Many firebases were also totally dependent on helicopters for construction, resupply and evacuation, and communist attacks against these fortresses could at times force their abandonment.<ref>John Martin Carroll, Colin F. Baxter. eds. 2007. The American Military Tradition: From Colonial Times to the Present. p 253-255</ref>\n\n=====Main force confrontation=====\nVC/NVA forces also faced American airmobile attacks in remoter areas, around their base camps and border sanctuaries. In these encounters NVA regulars and VC main-force units confronted their opponents, which sometimes included airlifted ARVN elements. Typically, such airmobile operations involved preparation of fire support bases, carved out of jungle terrain. Suitable areas (usually on high ground) were selected and heavily bombarded with artillery and airstrikes, then US engineers and security troops landed to commence construction of fortifications, bunkers, artillery emplacements and helicopter landing pads. The ability of helicopters to transport all the needed men and heavy equipment to almost any location gave American arms tremendous power and flexibility.<ref>Lt. Gen John Tolson, 1989, Airmobility: 1961\u20131971, US Army Vietnam Studies</ref> Several of these firebases could be built relatively quickly and deliver devastating mutually supporting supporting fire within a combat zone. Under the artillery umbrella, Marine and army infantry deployed for combat. The versatility of helicopters enabled such forces to be resupplied and maneuvered to numerous points on the field of battle. Firebases could also be \"leapfrogged\" or shifted in response to an advance or operational needs.<ref>Albert Conord, General Raymond Davis and the Principles of War. Monograph, Command and Staff College Marine Corps University, Quantico. 2002)</ref>\n\nAgainst such methods the NVA/VC uses a variety of approaches. If the objective was to cause attrition, NVA regulars would sometimes fight directly with their opponents using conventional tactics, particularly on the DMZ against the US Marines, and in remote border areas near Laos and Cambodia. Such attrition objectives were sometimes part of the North's overall strategy of drawing the Americans into remote areas, and away from key population clusters dominated or contested by the Viet Cong.<ref name=\"Davidson\">Davidson, Philip Davidson (1988). Vietnam at War: The History, 1946\u20131975. pp316-415</ref> Some American postwar memoirs comment favorably on the bravery and tactical discipline of the NVA in these encounters.<ref>Jim Brown, 2004. Impact Zone: The Battle of the DMZ In Vietnam, 1967\u20131968, pp. 74\u2013158</ref> To stem an advance from airmobile enemies NVA troops sometimes held their ground in prepared fortifications, buying time for their comrades to maneuver elsewhere. PAVN forces also attempted with limited success to attack the quickly constructed firebases from which the lethal firepower issued. Gaps between maneuvering US units were infiltrated and attacks mounted. Ambushes were also executed. Another tactic was fighting close to US units, so close that deadly American firepower from fixed bases was discouraged for fear of hitting their own troops.<ref>Impact Zone, 100\u2013174</ref> Tactical airstrikes in support of ambushed Americans units, were also met by well-timed PAVN pullbacks from the contact zone.<ref>The American Military Tradition p 253-255</ref> If things were going badly, PAVN forces withdrew to cross-border sanctuaries, where American ground forces were forbidden to follow. The fast-moving US operations, where there was no time for the usual months of communist initiative and rehearsed preparations, could catch PAVN off-guard, and casualties against US forces could be heavy. In Operation Dewey Canyon for example, US after-action reports claim some 1,617 NVA killed, for a loss of 121 marines killed, and the capture of hundreds of tons of munitions, equipment and supplies.<ref>The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military, Spencer C. Tucker ed. 2011, pp 290\u2013293</ref>\n[[File:Chinnook chopper delivers captured rice.jpg|thumb|Workhorse of heavy lift and firebase construction- the [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]]]]\nAgainst ARVN opponents, PAVN had greater success. In the ARVN Lam Son operation into Laos, ARVN troops were inserted by helicopter, covered by US airmobile, road advance operations and massive aerial firepower. The operation met heavy resistance, including intense antiaircraft fire. ARVN air insertions took them to the outskirts of Tchepone, but numerous helicopters were shot down or damaged. PAVN flanking tactics and ambushes also mauled the ARVN infantry battalions. US/ARVN reports claimed some 13,000 PAVN deaths and destruction of tons of material, but the ARVN was forced to withdraw, a maneuver that turned into a humiliating rout, salvaged only by unrelenting American airpower. Some 105 US helicopters were lost and an additional 615 damaged. The communist base area at Tchepone was back in business within a week. The vital role of sanctuary areas which could be developed in depth into strong bases was again illustrated.<ref>The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: pp 290\u2013293</ref>\n\n=====Protracted war and staying power=====\nAmerican airmobile tactics caused substantial casualties to the VC and NVA in thousands of such confrontations, but the communist strategy of attritional, protracted war, aided by plentiful manpower, was designed to absorb these losses, while wearing down their opponents over time. Successful air-mobile tactics also failed to address what happened after the mobile force and their helicopters departed. The population was often still left unsecured, subject once more to communist control, intimidation and infiltration. GVN/ARVN follow-up action might continue to be ineffective. Cross-border sanctuary routes were still open, and the bulk of the networks of tunnels, base camps and fortification honeycombing a region usually survived. Once their opponents had left, communist forces eventually regrouped, replaced their losses, and returned.<ref>Krepinevich, Andrew F., Jr. (1986). The Army and Vietnam, pp135\u2013274.</ref>\n\n===Offensive tactics: doctrine and planning===\nIn offensive operations, the VC/NVA typically sought to wear their opponents down by thousands of small attacks, each one gradually reducing enemy strength. Winning and holding specific blocks of territory was not as important as wearing down the enemy in accordance with [[Mao Zedong#War|Mao's]] dictum: ''\"To win territory is no cause for joy, to lose territory is no cause for sorrow.\"''<ref>On Guerrilla Warfare, by Mao Tse-tung, 1937, See the text of Mao's work online at www.marxists.org</ref> Bigger set-piece assaults on installations and bases as well as ambushes were sometimes executed, but the general pattern was one of protracted, attritional warfare, conducted by relatively small formations over a wide area. This meant absorbing large numbers of casualties, but both manpower and time were plentiful.\n\n[[File:Vcnvaattack2-med.jpg]]\n\n====Attack planning====\nPlanning for attacks was a careful, deliberate process, that could take many months. Below is an outline of some considerations and actions involved.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 179\u2013190}}\n\n'''Attack criteria and approval:''' The political dimensions of the attack were carefully considered, such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials. Planning involved a coordinated effort by military and [[logistics]] staff and the all-important political operatives, the party cadres who had the last word. Proposals for an operation were first sent up the chain of command. Depending on the scale of the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.\n\n'''Preliminary recon:''' If approved for further study, [[reconnaissance]] teams would case the area, analyzing political, logistics and military issues. Information gleaned from informers and sympathizers was joined to data from direct reconnaissance via patrols, infiltration or probing attacks. The analysis was comprehensive, and might involve size and composition of enemy forces, avenues of approach and withdrawal, civilian morale, hit lists of suspected traitors or troublesome dissenters who did not support the Revolution, available civilian labor to support logistics, detailed location of individual walls, ditches or fences and a host of other factors, both political and military.\n\n'''Rehearsals for the attack:''' If the objective was deemed feasible along political and military lines, detailed planning for the actual operation began, including construction of sand tables, and string and stick mock-ups of the target. Main Force or regular units tasked with the assault were selected and rehearsed. Each phase of the attack was carefully reviewed and rehearsed, including actions before opening fire, actions during fire, and actions taken upon withdrawal. Numerous postponements and changes might be undertaken until conditions and preparations were judged right to launch the assault.\n\n'''Logistics and security:''' Logistics formations might prepare coffins, pre-position medical or porter teams, and carefully tabulate the amount of ammunition needed for the operation. Guerrilla elements and laborers began to move supplies and material forward to support the impending battle. Security surrounding the operation was usually very tight with units only being informed at the last feasible moment.\n\n'''Echelons of attack:''' Depending on the complexity of the attack, numerous sub-divisions might be involved. Local guerrillas might conduct certain preliminary tasks, such as diversionary attacks, or clearance or denial (via mining, booby traps etc.) of certain areas for movement purposes. [[Sapper#PAVN and Viet Cong|Sappers]] might be tasked with opening the assault via infiltration and demolition of key objectives. A main force might swing into action once the sappers commenced their action. A blocking force might be deployed to ambush relief troops rushing to the battle area.\n\n====Attack doctrine: \"one slow, four quick\"====\nThe discussion on VC/NVA offensive methods below is adapted from ''Bernard B.

A battle sketch of a 4-pronged VC attack against the US [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] at Soiu Cut, 1968 is shown here <ref name=\"25th Inf 1968\">25th INFANTRY DIVISION, \"Battle of Soui Cut,\" Vol 3 No. 04, TROPIC LIGHTNING NEWS, January 22, 1968</ref>]]\n\nAttacks were invariably characterized by adherence to the principle of 'one slow, four quick' \u2013 a doctrine which prevailed in both attack and defense. In offensive operations the 'quick attack' was further broken down to incorporate 'three strongs' \u2013 strong fight, strong assault and strong pursuit. Presented in sequence the doctrine can be summarized as follows:\n\n'''Slow Plan''' \u2013 This involved a steady but low-key logistical build up in forward supply areas, being positioned ahead of the fighting forces to make a solid base for the operation. The degree of planning and preparation necessary to undertake a large operation could take as long as 6 months and often included numerous 'rehearsals'.\n* '''Quick Advance''' \u2013 This was a rapid movement forward, generally after a circuitous approach march meant to confuse the enemy. Once all the units in the operation were on track, a quick advance was usually made in small and inconspicuous groups to a forward staging area from where the attack would be launched.\n* '''Quick Attack''' \u2013 Here the attacking forces would be concentrated at the weakest point of the target as identified by prior reconnaissance. The duration of an attack could often be measured in minutes. Surprise was essential and large volumes of fire were poured on the target. Phase 2 of the attack involved the '''three strongs''':\n\n::* ''Strong fight'' \u2013 an attempt to achieve and exploit the element of surprise\n\n::* ''Strong Assault'' \u2013 against a pre-arranged position using concentration of force, effort and mass to overwhelm the defense.\n\n::* ''Strong pursuit'' \u2013 the attacking force's reserves would be committed to exploit the breaches in the targets defenses so as to deliver a decisive blow\n* '''Quick Clearance''' \u2013 The attacking force would rapidly re-organize and police the battlefield so as to remove weapons and casualties and was pre-planned to prevent confusion on the objective\n* '''Quick Withdrawal''' \u2013 Involved a quick egress from the battle area to a pre-arranged rendezvous point where the attackers would again break down into smaller groups to continue their dispersal.\n\n====Anatomy of an attack: Lima Site 85 Radar station \u2013 Laos 1968====\n[[File:Tacanraid.jpg|thumb|right|Tactical map of attack on Lima 85 radar site. NVA regulars, special forces and local guerrillas collaborated in the assault.]]\n\nThe careful methods of PAVN forces are illustrated in the successful attack against the US Air Force's TACAN radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered too tough to assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on [[Echelon formation|echelon]] of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted the rest of the mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.\n\nA full after-action report by PAVN was translated in 1986 and along with other US reports, furnishes numerous details about offensive tactics.<ref>US Air Force, Translation entitled \"Raid On the \"TACAN\" Site Atop Pha-Thi Mountain..\" [People's Army of Vietnam Publishing House], Hanoi, 1996.

This operation did not involve the typical quick withdrawal however. The attackers dug in on the site and defended it against counterattack, a pattern that occurred when the VC/NVA wanted to inflict maximum casualties, or achieve some political or propaganda objective, or control a particular area.\n\nIn this case, the radar station helped guide US bombers \u2013 including the devastating B-52s, and its capture was also a strong propaganda bonus demonstrating Communist strength in Laos to the local peoples. The base was isolated and superior forces could be concentrated on it, maximizing chances for success \u2013 a key consideration in a VC/NVA offensive operation. The raid also illustrated another method of neutralizing US airpower- attack its support facilities and bases on the ground. Subsequent attempts by Royal Laotian forces to retake the area were only partially successful. The mountain peak was never recaptured.<ref>US Air Force- translation \"Tacan Raid..\" Destatte 1967</ref>\n\n===Ambush techniques===\n[[File:vchelicopterfight2.jpg|thumb|right|The VC/NVA prepared the battlefield carefully. Siting automatic weapons at treetop level for example helped shoot down several US helicopters during the Battle of Dak To, 1967 <ref>Terrence Maitland, A CONTAGION OF WAR: THE VIETNAM EXPERIENCE SERIES, (Boston Publishing Company), 1983, p. 180</ref>]]\n\nThe terrain for the [[ambush]] had to meet strict criteria:\n* provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air\n* enable ambush force to deploy, encircle and divide the enemy\n* allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire\n* enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy\n* permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal\n\nOne important feature of the ambush was that the target units should 'pile up' after being attacked, thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the [[kill zone]] and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires. Terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy. The terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force, or which offered some protection to the target, was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre-registered for mortars.\n\nThe NVA/VC ambush formations consisted of:\n* lead-blocking element\n* main-assault element\n* rear-blocking element\n* observation posts\n* command post\n\nOther elements might also be included if the situation demanded, such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement.\n\nWhen deploying into an ambush site, the NVA first occupied several observation posts, placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using, its strength and firepower, as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander. Usually one main OP and several secondary OP's were established. Runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the OP's and the main command post. The OP's were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options. Frequently the OP's were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security. The command post was situated in a central location, often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site.\n\nReconnaissance elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300\u2013500 meters away. Sometimes a \"leapfrogging\" recon technique was used. Surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other. As the enemy drew close to the first, it fell back behind the last recon team, leaving an advance group in its place. This one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap, and the cycle rotated. This method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points, and allowed the recon groups to cover one another.<ref>RAND Corp 1967, p. 3\u2013195.</ref>\n====Ambush considerations====\n[[File:Attackrehearsal.jpg|thumb|right|Careful rehearsals marked attack preparations. Here a sand table model of an objective is studied.]]\n\nThe size and sophistication of an ambush varied from hasty meeting engagements, to full scale, carefully planned, regimental sized ambushes that included forces sufficient to encircle the enemy in the kill zone. In instances where smaller units didn't have enough troops to stage a complete five-element ambush they would set up one of the preferred ambush types and avoided close assaulting the enemy.\n\nThe preferred time for ambushes was just before dark. Enemy units were often deliberately delayed by the deployment of small patrols or snipers which harassed it. Roads and bridges to the rear of the enemy unit would also be sabotaged or mined to prevent withdrawal. This limited the enemy's use of air support and the deployment of reinforcements. It often also resulted in the ambushed unit being pinned in place for the night and having to set up a defensive perimeter in a hostile area.\n\nAll ambushes, in keeping with universal ambush doctrine, were intended to inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and to allow the ambushing force to withdraw before effective fire could be returned.\n\n====Ambush types====\nThe NVA/VC favored seven types of ambushes; Mine, Bloody Nose, Flank, L-shaped, Maneuver, V-shaped, and Z-shaped. The following discussion is adapted from the MACV monograph (''Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, 1966)''<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND \u2013 VIETNAM, Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, (San Francisco, JUNE 1966), pp. 1\u201314</ref> and from the US Army's Handbook: (''\"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" 1967'')<ref name=\"US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam 1967 pp. 1\u201344\"/>\n\n'''Mine Ambush. '''\nThis depended on the use of command-detonated mines which were triggered by hidden troops who held a detonating device connected to the demolitions by electrical wire. Mine ambush kill zones might also include punji traps or other homemade traps, land mines and natural obstacles. However, the ambush was always triggered by electrically detonating a mine, when enemy troops moved within the mine's killing range.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:KhS8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|VC/NVA operations generally aimed for heavy numerical superiority at the point of attack, whether in ambush or an assault operations]] -->\n\n'''Bloody Nose Ambush. '''\nUsed by small units against larger enemy forces as a means of harassment, delay and disruption. By positioning the ambush to [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] an avenue of approach, the NVA/VC obtained more effective results. Minefields, mantraps and booby traps were placed along both sides of the trail and perpendicular to it. As the enemy unit came under fire and attempted to maneuver right or left to close with the ambushers, the protective barriers would inflict casualties. As soon as the ambushing element realized that the enemy had advanced into, and taken casualties from, the mine/trap line, the ambushers withdrew to another pre-selected site where they might repeat the maneuver.\n\n'''Flank or Linear Ambush. '''\nThis was one of the simplest to set up and operate and was most commonly used by the NVA. It was also easy to get into and away from quickly. The ambush position was laid parallel to the target area. Mines or other obstacles were placed on the other side of the ambush site. Upon command, fire was brought to bear on the kill zone from multiple, overlapping firing positions. The linear ambush pumped bullets into the flank of a surprised enemy column.\n\n'''The 'L' Ambush. '''\nL-shaped ambushes included the most effective aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so that at least one machine gun could fire straight down the kill zone, enfilading it. Parallel to the kill zone and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.\n\nThe 'L' shaped ambush could also provide its own flank security. The base of the 'L' might be placed along either flank of the ambush position, not to fire into the kill zone, but to ambush enemy units that were attempting to flank the main ambush position along obvious avenues of approach.\n\nIn some situations the enemy located a reserve unit in line with the vertical bar of the 'L' forming a 'T' ambush. After the ambush was sprung, the enemy maneuvered his reserves to block the enemy line of withdrawal. The reserves either close assaulted or set up another ambush along the first linear obstacle to the immediate rear of the kill zone.\n\n'''The Maneuver Ambush. '''\nThis was usually directed against a road bound column of vehicles. The NVA/VC usually sprang it from high ground, near a bend in the road, which allowed cover and longer fields of fire for automatic weapons. Weapons frequently opened fire from positions within forty yards of the road or less.\n\nA road bend was included in the kill zone so that the end of the column was out of sight of the head of the column when the ambush was sprung. Interruption of a column's front-to-rear line of sight increased the likelihood that the head and tail of the column would split and try to fight separately.\n\nThe ambush was initiated by a small element striking the head of an enemy column and stopping it by fire. Then the main body would attack the column from the rear and/or flank, fragmenting it and rolling it up. The two strikes were timed close enough together so that the target column was engaged from both ends before it could deploy and face toward either danger.\n\n'''The 'V' Ambush. '''\nPositioned with its open mouth toward the enemy advance, this was a favorite of the VC. It was used in both fairly open terrain as well as jungle. The ambushers, in good concealment along the legs of the 'V', would wait until the enemy point had passed and then creep close to the trail. The 'V' ambush was virtually undetectable by enemy point or flank security until at least a portion of the enemy force was in the kill zone. Enfilading fire was often directed down the enemy axis of advance, and interlocking fire from each leg across the 'V'. The 'V' ambush also lent itself to the use of controlled mines and booby traps.\n\n'''The 'Z' Ambush. '''\nUsually laid along a road, the 'Z' ambush was both effective and confusing to the unit being ambushed. This complicated ambush was usually well planned with low bunkers lining the kill zone, often prepared months prior to the ambush. The ambush position was only occupied after word was received that an enemy battalion or larger unit would be using the road, which passed through the ambush site.\n\nThe long end of the 'Z' ambush was located on one side of a trail or road enabling the ambushers to employ both enfilading and flanking fire. It was also placed to neutralize attempts to flank the ambush from nearly every direction. Ambushing units deployed along the two short ends of the 'Z' could fire in either direction. The 'Z' ambush was dangerous to ambushers because ambush elements could easily fire into each other.\n\n====\"Bait\" tactics in ambush and harassment encounters====\n[[Image:Spider hole.png|left|150px|thumb|Spider holes were used both offensively and defensively]]\n\n=====VC/NCA \"bait\" tactics=====\nNumerous VC/NVA actions were quick, harassment affairs- firing a few mortar or artillery rounds and then disappearing. But others involved detailed planning and execution. These offensive and defensive tactics often involved luring ARVN and US troops into a maze of concealed fortifications, or into ambush positions, where they could be bled before the People's Army Forces withdrew. Initial positions were sometimes made to appear deliberately weak, including unmanned bunkers and light sniper-type resistance to bait enemy forces inside the killing zone. In the meantime, more lethal elements maneuvered and concentrated inside the fortified complex to inflict maximum damage.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\">Military Operations; Vietnam Primer \u2013 Dept of the Army, 1967 by Brig.Gen. SLA Marshall (Ret.) & Lt.Col. David Hackworth (Ret.) Al Baker, Commander B Co, 4/9 Inf, RVN '67 \u2013 '68</ref> Less elaborate than the fortified bunker complexes were individual \"spider holes\" \u2013 one-man excavations, some 2 feet wide by 4\u20135 feet deep, with a vegetation-covered lid, carefully camouflaged to be invisible from the air, or even foot-infantry several yards away. One US Marine memoir describes 12 such spider holes strung along both sides of a road, covered with grass and then dirt. As a US convoy passed, the NVA popped out of these hideaways and opened fire, pinning down the entire column. Supporting mortars behind the spider holes hammered the trapped Americans for several hours before the NVA pulled out.<ref>Jim Brown. 2004. Impact Zone: The Battle of the DMZ In Vietnam, 1967\u20131968, p. 70</ref>\n\n[[File:Nvarpgteam.jpg|thumb|right|NVA troops- 1968]]\nJungle terrain offered ideal environments for such methods, but ambushes and harassment tactics were also used in civilian areas. Firing a few rounds and withdrawing could not only lure enemy troops into a trap based on civilian structures but could also induce US/ARVN forces to unleash hasty [[artillery]] and tactical air strikes after relatively token provocation. This created excessive destruction in the built up areas and helped radicalize the populace against the US/ARVN troops.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\" />\n\nBait tactics exploited the US focus on [[Body count#Vietnam War|body counts]] and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H&I) fire.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|180\u2013211|date=November 2012}} One related method was to occupy a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline on the perimeter of the hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians they were supposed to be protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|57\u2013126|180\u2013213|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother VC/NVA variant was to let a few advance scouts show themselves briefly to US formations, hoping to lure them forward into a prepared trap. Since US forces were often eager for contact and body counts, this gambit was sometimes successful. One war history for example records the astonishment of an American unit that followed these lures, when above them, they observed what appeared to be the tree canopy moving. The \"moving trees\" turned out to be camouflaged VC recon elements that signaled for the trap to be sprung from entrenched bunkers, machine guns, and assault elements that hit the Americans from three sides, inflicting heavy casualties before pulling out.<ref>[[David Maraniss]], 2003. [[They Marched into Sunlight]], p 529-601</ref>\n\n=====American use of \"bait\" tactics=====\n\n[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001 (colorized).jpg|thumb|right|U.S. troops on field operation]]\nAmerican forces also ran their own version of bait tactics, hoping to turn the tables on opponents and increase kill ratios. Whether based on airmobile or more ground oriented \"search and destroy\" missions, this approach involved using small bodies of US troops as \"bait\" \u2013 inviting communist forces to attack them, after which air and artillery firepower, and follow-on forces held in reserve would presumably crush the attackers. Such tactics were heavily used to obtain the most valued metric- a high body count of enemy. According to US Major General William E. DePuy, commander of the 1st Infantry Division: ''\"The game in the jungle is to send in a small force as bait, let the enemy attack, and be able to react with a larger force in reserve nearby. But if the enemy doesn't want to fight, then the jungle goes off in 360 directions.\"''<ref>Gregory Daddis, 2011. No Sure Victory. p 90\u2013113</ref> American superiority and speed in bringing massive quantities of firepower to bear greatly aided this approach and at times, caused heavy communist casualties. However it also put tremendous psychological pressure on the small groups of US soldiers dangled as \"bait\" before the opposing VC/NVA, who continually whittled down American strength and morale with mining and booby traps, and consistently ambushed US formations in the field.<ref>Daddis, p90\u2013113</ref> In these encounters, as in the war as a whole, Communist forces still controlled the overall initiative of when and where to strike. Per one historian:\n\n<blockquote>For the individual soldier serving as \"bait,\" the unpredictable nature of search-and-destroy missions took a heavy psychological toll. Constant fear and tension pervaded American patrols with potential threats lurking in every hamlet or rice paddy... Despite Westmoreland's emphasis on finding and killing the enemy, these patrols often consisted of long marches, a great deal of searching, and little fighting.<ref>Daddis, p95</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne US Army primer (Marshall and Hackworth 1967) on fighting Communist forces recognized some of these problems and counseled against hasty reaction fires, or careless advances on contact.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\" /> Pressure from higher commanders for body counts in pursuit of the US attrition strategy contributed to these outcomes, sometimes making a bad tactical situation worse in the view of these and other authors.<ref>Marshall and Hackworth, Military Operations; Vietnam Primer \u2013 Dept of the Army, US Army 1967</ref>\n\n====Effectiveness of ambushes====\n[[File:Ambush-vc274vs11med.jpg|thumb|right|Simplified view of VC 274th Main Force ambush against US 11th Armored Cavalry.]]\n\nAmbushes were an important part of VC/NVA offensive effort, though they could sometimes be used defensively to thwart, delay or evade an attack. Against ARVN forces they could cause tremendous damage and close vital arteries of transport. Not all ambushes were fully successful however. While VC/NVA forces typically held the initiative as to where and when to strike, US mobility and firepower sometimes blunted or dispersed their attacks. In a war of attrition however, where the clock was running on impatient US commitments, time favored Communist forces.\n\nThe encounter between the [[VC 247th Regiment|274th VC Main Force Regiment]] and the US [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|11th Armored Cavalry]] shown in the diagram above illustrates several facets of the contending forces. The ambush took place on Highway 1, a vital road artery close to Saigon. There seems to have been careful preparation by Communist forces, including pre-built bunkers to shelter troops from US firepower along the line of retreat. A number of vehicles were destroyed but US airpower broke up the VC concentrations. A follow-up sweep by US forces killed a small number of additional VC but the bulk of them escaped.<ref>John A. Cash, John Albright, and Allan W. Sandstrum: \"Seven Firefights in Vietnam: CONVOY AMBUSH ON HIGHWAY 1, 21 NOVEMBER 1966,\" US Army, Command and General Staff College, Combined Arms Research Library, [[United States Army Center of Military History]]: Vietnam Studies, (DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., 1985). CMH Pub 70-4 (web ref: http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/7-ff/Ch2.htmm).</ref>\n\nVC formations continually refined their techniques. At the [[Battle of Ong Thanh]] in 1967 they sprung another ambush, inflicting heavy casualties on American troops. In this encounter the VC used a variety of methods to neutralize dreaded US firepower, including \"hugging\" or fighting close to US troops. They also moved rapidly ''parallel'' to the line of ambush, sliding along its length and thus presenting a harder target for American counter-attack. While US firepower caused significant losses for the VC throughout the conflict, these methods show a force that was learning, adapting, and growing more proficient on the battlefield. Time as always, still favored Communist forces. Sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam were always available, forbidden to US ground attack. Inevitably, the ARVN and Americans would have to move on. The VC and NVA regrouped and returned.<ref>Maraniss, David, They Marched into Sunlight: (Simon & Schuster, 2004){{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sapper attacks===\n====Sapper organization====\n[[File:nvasapper.jpg|thumb|Sappers were elite assault troops used by both NVA and VC Main Force units. Their speciality was attacking fixed positions]]\n\nThe [[People's Army of Vietnam|NVA]] used special assault troops or [[sapper]]s for a wide range of missions, sometimes by themselves, or sometimes as spearheads for a main-force echelon. The Viet Cong also deployed sappers particularly after [[Tet Offensive]] losses had made large-scale attacks hazardous. Called ''dac cong'' by the Vietnamese, sappers were a force economy measure that could deliver a stinging blow. They were an elite group, especially adept at infiltrating and attacking airfields, [[Fire support base#Components during Vietnam War|firebases]] and other fortified positions. About 50,000 men served in the PAVN as sappers, organized into groups of 100\u2013150 men, further broken down into companies of roughly 30\u201336 men, with sub-divisions into [[platoon]]s, squads and cells. Specialist troops such as radiomen, medics, and explosives experts were also attached. Many were volunteers. Sappers were often assigned to larger units (regiments, divisions etc.) \u2013 carrying out attacks and recon duties, but could also be organized as independent formations. Sappers trained and rehearsed carefully in all aspects of their craft and made use of a variety of equipment and explosive devices, including captured or abandoned American munitions.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\">James F. Dunnigan, The Perfect Soldier: Special Operations, (Citadel Press: 2003), pp. 150\u2013212</ref> Sappers also carried out intelligence missions and could work undercover. One of the sappers in the spectacular 1968 Tet Offensive attack against the US Embassy for example, was once a driver to the US Ambassador.<ref>Don North, \"VC Assault on the U.S. Embassy.\" Vietnam Magazine, February 2000, pp. 38\u201347, 72.</ref>\n\n====Sapper techniques====\n'''Assault planning.''' As with most VC Main Force/PAVN operations, the general pattern of \"one slow, four quick\" was followed \u2013 slow recon and initial penetration, then fast approach, attack, clearance and withdrawal. A typical assault began with a detailed recon of the target- pinpointing bunkers, ammo dumps, command and communications centers, barracks, power generation facilities and other vital points. Data from many other sources (farmers, spies, informers etc.) was collected and added to this. Detailed mortar ranges to each target area were plotted. A mock-up of the target was created and detailed rehearsals took place. Assaults were usually planned after nightfall.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /> Signalling systems were sometimes devised using colored flares. A typical signal package by the assault teams might be as follows: red flare: area hard to get into; white flare: withdrawal; green followed by white: reinforcements requested; green flare: victory.<ref name=\"Conroy\">Michael R. Conroy,\n\"SAPPER ATTACK ON FSB CUNNINGHAM,\" URL: (http://www.foxco-2ndbn-9thmarines.com/dewey_canyon.htm). Background descriptions from The Vietnam Experience: Fighting for Time, by Samuel Lipsman and Edward Doyle. (Boston Publishing Company, 1983)</ref>\n\n'''Assault organization and formations.''' Depending on the size of the attack, sappers were usually divided into 10\u201320 man assault groups or teams, which were further subdivided into 3\u20135 man assault cells. Each was tasked with destroying or neutralizing a specific area of the enemy defense. Four echelons might be employed on a typical sapper operation. An Assault group took on the main burden of the initial penetration through the wire and other defenses. A Fire-support group might be used to lay down covering fire via [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], mortars or machine guns at key points such as when the penetration elements cleared the wire, or at a set time, or via a pre-arranged signal. A small Security group might be deployed to position themselves to ambush reinforcements that attempted to rush to the defense of the besieged area. A Reserve group might be held back to exploit success, mop up or extract their fellow soldiers if the situation began to deteriorate.<ref>United States Army Center of Military History, Vietnam Studies, \"FIELD ARTILLERY, 1954\u20131973,\" by Major General David Ewing Ott, (DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY: WASHINGTON, D.C., 1975) pp. 1\u201313</ref> Deployment of these elements depended on the target and available forces. In larger attacks, where the sappers were to lead the way, the fire support, exploitation or security roles might be undertaken by bigger echelons of regular follow-on forces which used breaches created by the sappers to conduct their operations.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /><ref name=\"Nolan\" />\n\n[[File:sapperorg.jpg|thumb|left|Sapper raiding formation]]\n\n'''Initial assault movement.''' Movement to the target area was typically by long, roundabout routes to conceal the mission and fool enemy observation.<ref name=\"Conroy\" /> Once they had reached the target, infiltrators in the advance units spread themselves around the perimeter according to their assigned tasks. Detailed prior reconnaissance helped in this effort. They strapped weapons and explosive charges to their bodies to minimize noise as they maneuvered through the outer band of fortifications, and often covered their bodies in charcoal and grease to aid movement and make detection more difficult. Barbed wire was sometimes only cut partially, with the remaining strands broken by hand to muffle the tell-tale \"snip\" of wire-cutters. [[Tripflare]]s were neutralized by wrapping their triggers with cloth or strips of bamboo carried in the teeth of the vanguard fighters. [[M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine|Claymore mines]] might be turned in another direction.\n\nA [[Take point|point man]] usually preceded each team \u2013 crawling silently through defenses, probing with his fingers to detect and neutralize obstacles, while the others followed behind. Sometimes gaps in the wire were created by tying down strands to make an assault corridor. Woven mats might be thrown over barbed wire to facilitate passage. Sappers often used [[Bangalore torpedo]]es made from blocks of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] tied to bamboo poles to blast open assault routes. Attack routes often took unexpected avenues of approach, such as through the trash pits of US [[Firebase Cunningham]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Conroy\" />\n\n'''The main attack and withdrawal.''' Based on the target and relevant military situation, some attacks proceeded mainly by stealth, with little initial covering fire until the last moment. Breaches might be created in the wire at several points, then left open while the penetration teams aligned with their objectives, and hunkered down, awaiting the hour of decision. Other strikes, particularly against heavily defended US targets used a barrage of covering fires to keep defenders penned in their positions, heads down, while the assault groups moved stealthily into position. Targets were usually hit in priority order- according to the level of danger they presented to the sapper units, or based on relevant military or political objectives. Emphasizing utmost ruthlessness in attack, the sub-doctrine of the ''\"3 strongs\"'' (surprise, concentration of force and exploitation of success) was generally followed.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Keith William Nolan, Sappers In the Wire: The Life and Death of Firebase Mary Ann, (Texas A&M University Press: 1995) pp. 23\u2013119, 200\u2013245</ref>\n\nIf discovered, the sappers often sprang up and attacked immediately. Diversionary assaults and fires were also created to screen the main sapper effort. Once the fierce fighting of the main phase was over, the pullout began. While small rearguard type elements might be left in place for delaying or diversionary purposes, withdrawal was generally a quick affair. Valuable enemy weapons and other equipment were rounded up, and the bodies of the dead and wounded were removed. Detailed after-action reports and \"self-criticism\" exercises were conducted by VC/PAVN forces, absorbing lessons learned and sharpening their skills for the next assault.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /><ref name=\"Nolan\" />\n\n====Examples of sapper attacks====\n[[File:Destroyed_helicopter_cuchi_1969.jpg|thumb|Sappers destroyed 9 heavy lift helicopters and damaged 3 at Cu Chi Base Camp, February 26, 1969.

This particular action involved an apparent mix of VC and NVA elements that destroyed nine [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] heavy lift helicopters, damaged three more and blew up an ammo dump.<ref name=\"25th Inf 1969\">25th Infantry Division, 242d Aviation Company (Aslt Spt Hel) 269th Aviation Battalion (Combat) 12th Aviation Group (Combat), \"After Action Report 45\", CU CHI BASE CAMP, February 26. 1969, US Army: 1969, pp. 1\u201312, weblink: http://25thaviation.org/history/id829.htm</ref> VC sappers by some reports led the assault, with NVA providing follow-on ground or fire-support attacks. However, by 1969, most Main Force VC formations were manned by northern soldiers, and communist forces continually used shifting unit numbers to confuse ARVN and US [[order of battle]] experts,<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" /> so the VC-NVA distinction and unit designations are less than clear.\n\nPOW interrogations revealed close coordination with local guerrilla elements and informers, including provision of detailed drawings and sketches of the target area. Penetration teams achieved almost complete surprise, with the sappers cutting 10 barbed wire fences, and advancing without being detected by sentries, obstacles or patrols. A rocket attack was the signal for the sappers to go into action against the helicopters and soldiers. Aside from the aircraft, US troop losses were comparatively light (1 dead, 3 wounded versus some 30 NVA or VC dead),<ref name=\"25th Inf 1969\"/> nevertheless the incident reveals the ability of the VC/NVA to stay in the field while they rebuilt after the losses of Tet.\n\n=====Sapper attack on Firebase Mary Ann, 1971=====\n[[File:Nvasapperweapons.jpg|thumb|Weapons captured in the aftermath of sapper attack against US 46th Infantry at Firebase Mary-Ann, 1971]]\n\nThe attack against US Army [[Battle of FSB Mary Ann|Firebase Mary Ann]] in 1971 by the Main Force VC 409th Sapper Battalion, is another example of these techniques. Surprise was achieved on the objective \u2013 with many on the US side not believing the NVA would attack such a small outpost. The Firebase had seen little serious threat in the past, and was manned by 250 mostly American soldiers and some ARVN. In addition, earlier helicopter and aircraft operations at the base had touched off a number of warning [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] in the wire surrounding the complex. These had not been replaced when the attack came.<ref name=\"Nolan\" /> A mortar barrage was laid down at a set time to open the battle. This provided cover for the sappers, who were already pre-positioned far forward, to move quickly towards their objectives. They destroyed the Battalion Operations Center and a number of command posts, and created general mayhem before withdrawing when helicopter gunships arrived.\n\nThe final US toll was almost 30 dead and 82 wounded. Suspicion still lingers about this controversial attack, including charges that VC infiltrators posed as ARVN soldiers to facilitate the assault.<ref name=\"Nolan\" /> If so, the incident demonstrates the long reach of the VC intelligence services, and their sophisticated planning and execution of the assault. Several senior American commanders were relieved of duty or were reprimanded after the event. Audaciously, the VC attacked the ruins of the firebase the following day with machine gun fire. One Vietnam War historian calls this incident the \"U.S. Army's most blatant and humiliating defeat in Vietnam.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 1.</ref>\n\n=== VC/NVA use of terror ===\n{{Further|Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure#VC/NVA use of terror}}\n\n===Final victory by conventional forces===\n====Improvements in PAVN performance over the 1972 Offensive====\nAssessment of VC/NVA performance must look beyond the American interlude, and the guerrilla warfare phases to the final outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. Their capabilities had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 [[Easter Offensive]] were remedied.\n\nIn 1972 there was distinct weaknesses in the coordination of armor, artillery and infantry, with the three fronts of advance failing to support one another satisfactorily.<ref name=\"Stacey\">{{cite |last=Stacey |first= K. |title=Armour in Vietnam: the lessons of 1972 and 1975 |journal=Defence Force Journal, Australia |issue= May/June 1980 (No.22)}}</ref> Armored forces were often committed in penny packets, with lack of effective [[infantry]] support and artillery co-operation, making them vulnerable to US and ARVN countermeasures. The logistics system was also unable to support the [[Wiktionary:tempo#English|tempo]] of full-scale conventional battle. By 1975, these weaknesses had been substantially corrected, and a sophisticated military machine attained a rapid victory. The [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] was increasingly a network of paved roads easing the logistical flow for the Offensive and tactical concentration and coordination of infantry, armor and artillery was much tighter.<ref name=\"Stacey\" />\n\nIntegral to the PAVN advance was combined infantry and armor columns, that threw ARVN opponents off balance with swift moves and rapid concentrations. Extensive use was made of the ''\"blooming lotus\"'' tactic to assault cities and towns.<ref name=\"Lamont\">{{cite |first=Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. |last=Lamont |title=Urban Warrior: A View From North Vietnam |work=Marine Corps Gazette |date=April 1999 |url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6453/uwvietnam.html |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6453/uwvietnam.html&date=2009-10-25+09:27:09 |archivedate=2009-10-25 }}</ref> Rather than surround them and work inward in the orthodox manner of many contemporary Western armies, PAVN mobile columns bypassed opposition on the target's perimeter, and drove inward to seize vital command and control nodes in the central areas first, before striking ''outward'' to liquidate opposition. A reserve force was held on standby to defeat counterattacks against the penetration force.<ref name=\"Lamont\" />\n\nA leap-frogging tactic was also employed to maintain momentum. Spearhead units would sometimes deploy quickly to tackle opposition, while follow-on echelons bypassed such engagements to strike deeper.<ref name=\"Stacey\" /> Infiltration units like sappers also assisted the push by seizing bridges, road junctions and other key points ahead of the main forces. Deception measures were also widely used, with diversionary operations across a broad area, and troop movements timed until the last minute, to avoid telegraphing the main points of attack. Such methods for example, enabled quick conquest of towns like ''[[Ban Me Thuot]]'' and their surrounding highways, and paved the way for further operations towards Saigon.<ref name=\"Lamont\" />\n\nTerror and panic played their part in the NVA/PAVN advance, particularly in the [[T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean|Central Highlands]] where five rapidly moving divisions overwhelmed hapless ARVN formations. During the retreat from the Highlands, massive columns of civilian refugees mingled with fleeing South Vietnamese troops. PAVN forces shelled these columns indiscriminately with mortars, rockets and artillery, killing over 100,000 civilians by some estimates, and liquidating some 40,000 out of 60,000 retreating ARVN soldiers.<ref>{{cite |first1=James S. |last1=Olsen |first2=Randy |last2=Roberts |title=Where the Last Domino Fell |location= New York |publisher= St Martin's |date=1991 |page= 259}}</ref>\n\n====PAVN as a modern, professional army====\n[[File:HCMC2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The fall of Ban Me Thuot]]\n\nThe final PAVN triumph was aided by numerous weaknesses and failures in South Vietnamese forces and leadership.<ref name=\"James\">Anthony James, The War for South Viet Nam, 1954\u20131975, (Greenwood Publishing, 2001), pp. 57\u2013206</ref> Thieu's \"hold everywhere\" strategy in the months before the Northern offensive stretched ARVN forces too thinly and withered away any central reserve. Ongoing corruption and incompetence dogged and demoralized the ARVN rank and file. For example, rampant inflation wiped out the inadequate wages of troops that already had little medical care available. In a society where regular full-time soldiers and their dependents made up about 20% of the population, this amounted to widespread impoverishment of important segments of South Vietnamese society.<ref name=\"James\" /> Desertion rates after the American pullout approached 25% of total force strength, reductions that were not made up when the end came. Of the total 1,000,000 men theoretically mobilized for defence (including about half a million militia), only about 10% were direct combat troops.<ref name=\"James\" /> Disastrous leadership decisions in the final weeks of fighting such as the [[Wiktionary:debacle#Noun|debacle]] in the highlands (see [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]]) sealed the doom of a troubled force.<ref name=\"James\" />\n\nSuch weaknesses were skillfully exploited by the fast-moving Northern conquest, in a final campaign that illustrates a coming of age for the PAVN forces in the minds of some Western historians.\n\n{{quote|Almost a quarter century ago, a third world country won the final battle of a long and difficult war through the use of an unexpected and decidedly modern strategy.

Moreover, it paid only lip service to the old [[Dogma#Other usage|dogma]] of a popular uprising.

Why the North Won the Vietnam War p 1-17</ref> tend to assign the Vietnamese a secondary role in terms of the developments that led to victory by the North. For example, while American combat deaths are often referenced in the large number of Western histories, comparatively little mention is made of the 275,000 combat deaths suffered by the South Vietnamese, almost 5 times the American total. Just the evacuation of [[Da Nang]] in March 1975 cost the South Vietnamese an estimated 60,000 deaths, more than total US military losses for the entire conflict.<ref>James H. Willbanks, Abandoning Vietnam: How America Left and South Vietnam Lost Its War, (University Press of Kansas, 2004) pp. 3\u2013280</ref>\n\nThere is often heavy concentration on the American effort and its mistakes, contradictions and strategy, but comparatively little on the Vietnamese side, save as it ties into the theme of American failure or missteps.<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\">Marc Jason Gilbert, Why the North Won the Vietnam War, (Palgrave Macmillan: 2002), pp. 83\u2013249</ref> Whatever the merits of these arguments about war coverage, it is clear that the main 8-year American interlude (albeit important) was only a relatively short one in the decades-old struggle for [[hegemony]] in the Second Indochina War.\n\n===VC/NVA battlefield performance===\nVC/NVA performance waxed and waned with the fortunes of war. Weapons and equipment at the small arms level were equal with those of their enemies, and in some categories of heavy artillery they also achieved parity. The struggle against US bombing saw deployment of one of the most sophisticated air defence systems in the world, albeit with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance. In other categories they could not match the wide range of advanced US technology.\n\nAgainst their ARVN opponents the VC/NVA generally did well in both guerrilla and conventional warfare, and were on the verge of victory in 1965, before the American intervention. While ARVN forces achieved a number of impressive successes,<ref>Lewis Sorley, \"Courage and Blood: South Vietnam's Repulse of the 1972 Easter Offensive,\" Parameters, 29 (Summer 1999), 38\u201356</ref> they were, on balance, clearly outclassed by the PAVN armies, which suffered from weaknesses in certain areas, such as airpower and the handling of armor- illustrated particularly in the 1972 Easter Offensive.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> Subsequent campaigns in Indochina however, illustrate a number of PAVN strengths \u2013 from the rapid victory of 1975, to the initial 1979 invasion of Cambodia which saw well coordinated [[corps]]-sized combined arms operations including an amphibious assault against the coast. PAVN strengths were also shown in its defensive operations during the 1979 [[Sino-Vietnamese War]].<ref>A Tale of Five Generals: Vietnam's Invasion of Cambodia. By: Pribbenow II, Merle L., Journal of Military History, Apr2006, Vol. 70 Issue 2, p459-486</ref>\n\n[[File:pavnlaos.jpg|thumb|right|NVA troops survey a ruined ARVN bunker, 1971]]\nAgainst US forces the record is more mixed. There were a number of successes particularly in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American strategic mobility, using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia Drang, Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than the other way round. However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, the [[linchpin]] of their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.\n\n===Elements in NLF/PAVN triumph===\n[[File:Sapper1970.jpg|right|thumb|Main Force Viet Cong Sapper \u2013 1970. After the devastating losses of Tet, sapper operations gained in importance as the VC/NVA rebuilt.]]\n\nThere are numerous keys to the final outcome of the Vietnam War. A few of these interrelated factors are summarized below:<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\"/>\n\n# '''A protracted, integrated strategy that maximized Northern strengths against the weaknesses of their Southern and American opponents.''' This was the strategy of protracted war, that tightly integrated political and military factors, and slowly weakened opposition over time by an attritional campaign. Protracted war also involved sequencing a mix of combat styles. This ranged from small-scale [[guerrilla]] attacks, to main-force battles that even when costly, atrophied enemy strength and morale. It also drew powerful US forces into peripheral areas, while allowing VC/NVA forces to control the key to any [[People's War]], the population. All these measures were keyed to political ends, and included ruthless assassination, kidnapping and sabotage efforts throughout the war. To some US soldiers who fought against the VC/NVA, like US [[Lieutenant General|Lt. General]] [[Phillip Davidson]], Chief of Military Intelligence from 1967 to 69,<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|803\u2013850|date=November 2012}} and US war historians like [[Andrew Krepinevich|Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr.]]<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> this strategy was a superior one in terms of [[Communist]] objectives and strengths, and American/GVN weaknesses.\n# '''Superior motivation and morale.''' Seen in terms of determination to achieve final victory in Indochina, Communist motivation and [[morale]] was superior to that of their enemies. For VC/NVA forces the conflict was not simply another costly Cold War episode but a life and death struggle spanning generations. Some northern leaders stressed the predominance of spiritual over material factors,<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" /> a notion sometimes paid for with dire results and painful lessons under enemy (particularly American) firepower. Nevertheless, some scholars argue that over the course of almost two decades, both [[PAVN]] leadership and the ordinary PAVN soldier were more determined to achieve final triumph, and more willing to expend lives and treasure towards this end, than their opponents.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|801\u2013850|date=November 2012}}<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\"/>\n# '''Detailed, overlapping organization backed by thorough going indoctrination.''' Historian Douglas Pike in 'Viet Cong' (1966) asserts that the closest thing to a \"secret weapon\" of the revolutionary forces was ''organization''<ref>Douglas Pike. 1966. Viet Cong: Organization and Techniques of the National Front. 33\u201359; 97\u2013133;404</ref> \u2013 tight, overlapping mechanisms of structure that enmeshed its subjects in a tight web of control. This structure included the parallel system of party control at all levels of civilian and military life, the overlapping plethora of organizations from province to village hamlet that enhanced resource exploitation, the three-man cells all troops were organized into, and the heavy use of \"criticism and self-criticism\" that pervaded all levels. One American Vietnam War historian calls the Viet Cong ''\"more disciplined and organized than nearly any insurgents in history.\"''<ref>Mark Moyar,\"The Phoenix Program and Contemporary Warfare,\"Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 47. (No. 4th Quarter 2007), pp. 155\u2013159</ref>\n# '''Logistical, military, political and diplomatic support by friendly communist nations.''' Aid from China and the Soviet Union was indispensable to the tough military machine on the ground, and the equally tenacious machine on the diplomatic and political fronts. This aid made North Vietnam dependent on their suppliers, but it was able to play one off against the other to enhance their bargaining power and maintain a stance of relative independence.<ref>Nicholas Khoo. 2011. Collateral Damage: Sino-Soviet Rivalry and the Termination of the Sino-Vietnamese Alliance. pp 20\u201375</ref> Support by communist nations also included the threat of massive Chinese intervention if the US opted to eliminate the northern regime by a conventional invasion, or threatened China itself. This threat, or perceived threat, effectively stymied that option. Though China was reluctant to confront the US directly in another Korean War style morass, it conveyed deterrent threats to the United States not only through military aid and deployment of over 300,000 supporting PLA troops in North Vietnam, but on some occasions, signaled China's readiness for action through such indirect diplomatic channels as Pakistan and Britain.<ref>Khoo, Collateral Damage, 30\u201331</ref> Some historians argue that the Chinese threat was overstated, and that Peking was more concerned with internal turmoil and the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, and was willing to tolerate US intervention ''\"as long as that intervention did not include rolling back communism in North Vietnam.\"'' This implicit guarantee of the North's survival, backed by the ultimate menace of massive Chinese action, curtailed America's full freedom of action.<ref>Jeffery Record, 1998. The Wrong War: Why We Lost in Vietnam. pp40-41</ref>\n# '''Logistical resilience, manoeuvring space and a massive manpower pool.''' The enormous, and successful Communist logistics effort in the face of devastating enemy firepower provided another key to victory. Supplied by supportive socialist allies, distribution to the battle zone, utilizing the manoeuvring space that was the Ho Chi Minh and [[Sihanouk Trail]]s was an impressive logistical feat. This vast space \u2013 encompassing parts of [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] as well as the two Vietnams, stymied American and South Vietnamese interdiction efforts. Thorough organization and lavish expending of manpower were the skeleton and muscle of this achievement. The manpower available to communist forces in the struggle was critical. As noted above, some of this was external, with CHina providing over 300,000 troops to maintain logistical support on roads, railways, supply instillations and military facilities such as anti-aircraft batteries, and cross-border sanctuary airbases. Within South Vietnam, VIet Cong forces around the time of the Tet Offensive are estimated by some Western analysts as around 300,000 main force fighters, local guerillas and cadre.<ref>Dougan, Clark; Weiss, Stephen; et al. (1983). Nineteen Sixty-Eight. p 11-48</ref> Northern sources claims a combined total of 690,000 NVA and VC troops in place as early as 1966.<ref>Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954\u20131975. 2002, p. 78-211</ref> The exact communist Order of Battle on the ground was a matter of controversy with competing and shifting estimates between American MACV and CIA analysts, but most agreed on the huge manpower pool available to the north - with approximately 175,000 males reaching draft-age annually, and a total of 4 million draft-age males available for the war.<ref>CIA Intelligence Memorandum, 1966, The Current status of PAVN Infiltration to South Vietnam. Central Intelligence Agency.

In terms of the tremendous effort to achieve victory at any cost, one American war historian asserts: \"''By any standard of human endeavor and achievement, what happened on the Ho Chi Minh Trail must rank high among the works of men and women.''\"<ref name=\"Prados\">John Prados, The Blood Road, p. 374</ref>[[File:Pavnbattle.jpg|thumb|right|The PAVN/NLF military effort was generally much more determined and organized than that of the ARVN.<ref>Douglas Pike. 1966.

While they absorbed severe blows at times, the VC/NVA had time on their side under the strategy of protracted conflict. Communist forces suffered some one million dead according to their own estimates <ref name=\"North\" /> but this was relative in a conflict where manpower reserves were plentiful and key allies like China were providing tens of thousands of troops to keep border supply and transport routes open. Tempo manifested itself at the local level. Except for those times when they were forced into a battle by US sweeps, or during deployment for a major operation, Communist troops spent most of their time in area control and consolidation, not fighting. Overall, they controlled the initiative \u2013 when, where and with what intensity to strike. Tempo was also a factor in the long-term struggle. Communist forces were able to meter their losses as the conflict waxed and waned \u2013 depending on the political, diplomatic and military situation \u2013 scaling back after the setbacks of Tet, and increasing effort dramatically in 1972 and 1975, when the situation looked more favorable.<ref name=\"Davidson\"/>{{rp|318|date=November 2012}}\n# '''Shrewd performance on the political and diplomatic fronts.''' Communist forces waged a number of effective propaganda and diplomatic campaigns to exploit contradictions in the camps of their enemies. One key triumph of politics (albeit backed by force of arms) was the continued use of sanctuaries in supposedly \"neutral\" countries, the cultivation of indigenous \"liberation forces\" like the [[Pathet Lao]], and the inability of their opponents to make significant inroads against these indispensable rear bases. Other triumphs included the division of American opinion ([[Wiktionary:epitome#Noun|epitomized]] in visiting American celebrities and media reports), the isolation of the Southern regime from their American backers, the \"talk-fight\" stonewalling strategy to extract maximum concessions, and perceptive calculation of the limits US leaders would observe in deploying military force.<ref name=\"North\">Edward Doyle, Samuel Lipsman, Terrence Maitland- THE NORTH: The Vietnam Experience, (Boston Publishing Company, 1986), pp. 31\u2013157</ref> Considerations of political performance must include the efficacy of ''dau tranh'' strategy in the creation and manipulation of numerous \"front\" or shell groups within South Vietnam to isolate its ruling regime, mobilize grassroots support for revolutionary aims, and encourage evasion and defection among its armed forces.<ref>Pike, Viet Cong.. 32\u201359</ref>\n# '''The ruthless determination of leaders of the revolutionary struggle.''' This includes both northerners and a heavy southern presence in the North's ruling echelons. By the time of the final victory in 1975, many of these leaders had been on the field of struggle for two decades. There was often division within this leadership. More conservative \"north-firsters\" clashed with \"south-firsters\" but ultimately, their collective determination prevailed.\n# '''Failure of the South Vietnamese leadership to develop an effective political narrative and administration.''' Some of this failure grew out of the difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, and inefficient administration. Despite these vulnerabilities however, it is also clear that millions of South Vietnamese opposed the takeover of their society by a communist dictatorship and fought resolutely against this outcome.<ref>Lewis Sorley 1999. A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and the Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam. 1\u201317; 372\u2013389</ref> The southern regime however, could not develop a convincing political narrative and the degree of thorough political organization and mobilization to meet it, compared to their opponents. The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain.<ref>Sorley, A Better War.. 1\u201317; 372\u2013389</ref> Given a merciless civil war, ultimate settlement of the conflict was between the Vietnamese.\n#'''Corruption, incompetence and ineffective politicization of South Vietnamese military leadership.''' Southern ineffectiveness was reflected in the appointment of military leaders based on loyalty or family ties rather than professional competence, the ineffectual intertwining of officers in both military and civilian affairs, and widespread nepotism, corruption and factionalism that focused on personal agendas and profit rather than winning the war at hand<ref>Jeffrey J. Clarke. Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965\u20131973. US Govt- GPO, 1988, pg 18-24</ref>. The best ARVN units such as the Rangers, Marines, paratroops and special forces were too often unavailable for battle because they were held back by Saigon's leaders for internal political maneuvering<ref>Clarke. Advice and Support 7\u201352</ref>. PAVN/NLF military leadership was likewise heavily politicized, but in the communist case, effective management and accountable personnel were in place to fight the war to a victorious conclusion. RNAF effectiveness in combat was mixed, and often marred by incompetent higher leadership, such as the performance of General [[Hoang Xuan Lam]] (later relieved of command) during  the 1971 Laos incursion). Lower level leaders in general made a better showing, but too often lacked initiative, determination and skill under battle conditions. There were exceptions at all levels, such as Lt. General Ngo Quang Truong, and some lower level officers<ref>Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong. The Easter Offensive Of 1972. 2015,</ref> but the general pattern above fared badly against the more dedicated and efficient NVA/NLF.<ref>James, The War for South Viet Nam, 1954\u20131975, pp. 57\u2013206</ref> Even such key fundamentals as mobilizing avaliable troop strength or furnishing supplies to the front line were mired in malfeasance. Quartermaster units for example sometimes demanded bribes before furnishing fighting men with rice, ammunition, gasoline, and other material. <ref>Michael A. Eggleston. 2017. Dak To and the Border Battles of Vietnam, 1967-1968. p 151</ref> As much as 10 percent of the regular armed forces were non-existent \"ghost\" soldiers (deserters, disabled, deceased etc) who still appeared on the official rosters with leaders pocketing the extra payroll of the bogus troops.<ref>Clarke, Advice and Support, p 11-78</ref> Such weaknesses were untenable in the face of a ruthlessly determined northern enemy.\n# '''The mobilizing force of [[Marxism-Leninism]], mated to Vietnamese [[nationalism]].''' While in some ways Marxism was alien to the Vietnamese landscape, revolutionary leaders succeeded in blending it with traditional Vietnamese [[xenophobia]] and a growing modern sense of nationalism. Marxism also presented a sense of inevitable historical progress that enhanced mobilization, and included the key role of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Lao Dong]], the Communist Party of North Vietnam. These factors helped mobilise some support within South Vietnam.[[File:PAVNforces.jpg|right|thumb|PAVN troops. By the end of the conflict, they were a tough, proficient modern force, well equipped to carry out conventional operations.]]\n# '''Ability to learn and adapt.''' Against both the US and ARVN the VC/NVA demonstrated an ability to adapt on the battlefield. They learned from their mistakes and adopted tactics and measures to reduce losses. These ranged from deep tunnel systems, \"hugging\" techniques in infantry battles, widespread random mining, fast-moving sapper assaults, treetop fighting positions to foil US helicopters, deployment of new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supplied technology like man-portable missiles, to simple avoidance of battle without overwhelming numerical superiority. The keen study of their own strengths and weaknesses through \"criticism and self-criticism,\" and the systematic distribution of \"lessons learned\" through reports and memorandum was part of this crucial learning ability, demonstrating that the NLF/PAVN were not the hapless peasants of popular lore, but a well equipped, serious and sophisticated military organization.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[NLF and PAVN strategy, organization and structure]]\n* [[NLF and PAVN logistics and equipment]]\n* [[Strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare]]\n* [[Weapons of the Vietnam War]]\n* [[History of Vietnam]]\n* [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]]\n* [[The United States and the Vietnam War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite |author=RAND Corp |title=Insurgent Organization and Operations: A Case Study of the Viet Cong in the Delta, 1964\u20131966 |location=Santa Monica |date= August 1967 |ref={{harvid|RAND Corp|1967 }} }}\n*{{ cite |first1=Michael Lee |last1=Lanning |first2=Dan |last2=Crag |title=Inside the VC and the NVA |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1993 |ref=harv }}\n\n[[Category:Vietnam War tactics]]\n[[Category:Guerrilla warfare tactics]]\n[[Category:Viet Cong]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|North Vietnamese and Viet Cong tactics in the Vietnam War}}\n{{broader|Vietnam War}}\n{{citation style|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Viet Cong soldier DD-ST-99-04298.jpg|thumb|Member of a NLF/Viet Cong Main Force Unit.

Isaacs. 1998. Without Honor: Defeat in Vietnam and Cambodia</ref>\n\nThe NLF was an umbrella of front groups to conduct the insurgency in [[South Vietnam]]. The NLF was affiliated with independent groups and sympathizers. The armed wing of the NLF was regional and local guerrillas, and the People's Liberation Armed Forces ([[Viet Cong#Names|PLAF]]). The PLAF was the \"Main Force\" \u2013 the ''Chu Luc'' full-time soldiers of the NLF's military muscle. Many histories lump both the NLF and the armed wing under the term \"Viet Cong\" in common usage. Both were tightly interwoven and were in turn controlled by the North.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}<ref>Stanley Karnow, Vietnam: A History, (Viking Press: 1983)</ref>{{rp|12\u2013239|date=November 2012}} Others consider the Viet Cong to primarily refer to the armed elements.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\">Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg, Inside the VC and the NVA, (Ballantine Books, 1993), pp. 33\u201356</ref> The term [[Vietnam People's Army|PAVN]] (People's Army of Vietnam) identifies regular troops of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).

Such initiative was sometimes blunted by ARVN countermeasures, or the aggressive \"[[search and destroy]]\" tactics of US forces under Gen. [[William Westmoreland]], and the improved pacification measures of his successor Gen. [[Creighton Abrams]]. Nevertheless, over the vast area that was South Vietnam, [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], Communist forces typically held the initiative in a conflict extending over a decade. One US military study for example found that 88 percent of all engagements against US forces were initiated by the enemy.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\">Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., The Army and Vietnam [Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986]</ref>{{rp|188\u2013192|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere were generally two approaches to metering losses. The first was [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] \u2013 operations were conducted to inflict maximum losses on ARVN/US forces. This meant expending lives and resources in attacks (ambushes, raids etc.) or in defensive operations (digging in to fight, bleeding opponents and then withdrawing when enemy forces grew too strong). Attacks were scaled up or down depending on a myriad of factors including the political situation in a particular area.<ref>Gen W. C. Westmoreland, \"Report on Operations in South Vietnam, January 1964 \u2013 June 1968,\" in Report on the War in Vietnam [As of 30 June 1968], by United States Pacific Command [Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1969], appendix L, 284.</ref> The second approach was avoidance of battle unless numerical superiority and chances of success were good. In the Vietnam War, most Communist units (including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics) spent only a limited number of days a year fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an ARVN/US action, most of the time was spent in population control, training, intelligence gathering, propaganda indoctrination or construction of [[fortification]]s, with Communist troops typically only fighting an average of 1 day in 30.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> In essence, the VC/NVA largely fought on the ground only when they wanted to fight.\n\nMastery of the initiative made the US attrition strategy of seeking big battles problematic, and also undermined GVN/ARVN attempts at pacification. Manpower losses could always be made up with more infiltration of regulars from the North and additional recruitment of VC within the South. The arrival of US forces in 1965 saw a shift back to small unit and guerrilla warfare. The average of [[battalion]] sized attacks for example dropped from 9.7 per month to 1.3, while small-scale actions climbed by 150 percent.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> While US troops were being lured to remote regions in pursuit of base areas, big battles and large [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] ratios, 90% of all attacks were consistently occurring in the 10 percent of the country that held over 80 percent of the population according to one American study covering 1966 and 1967. The US strategy thus not only failed to fully come to grips with an elusive enemy on the outer edges, but also failed to consistently keep them away from the inner populated areas as well.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />\n\n===Learning and adaptability===\n[[File:PAVNcriticism.jpg|left|thumb|Criticism and self-criticism sessions and continuous study helped communist forces effectively adapt lessons learned on the battlefield]]\n\nThe VC/NVA battle philosophy placed great stress on learning and adaptability, and systematically strived to improve battle techniques at the lowest levels. Units and individuals were expected to be problem solvers, making creative use out of what might be fleeting opportunities and scarce resources. After engagements, detailed after-action reports were conducted, and detailed analyses of various problems in the field were carried out. After an action, both individuals and units examined their performance through widespread \"criticism and self-criticism\" sessions, and even commanders were taken to task at the appropriate levels. The lessons learned were continually incorporated into NVA/VC operations. Experiments were also carried out by different units, and the results were disseminated via conferences, field manuals, memoranda and new procedures.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\nThis capability to adapt was crucial when facing new [[technology]], such as US [[helicopters]]. Several studies were conducted on how to combat the menace from above, and aiming and firing procedures were worked out for a variety of weapons, such as heavy [[machine guns]]. In one Viet Cong publication, shooting 1\u00bd lengths ahead of the aircraft was deemed satisfactory for striking vital engine parts.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }} Firing tables were also constructed and disseminated for different types of US aircraft. Countermeasures, including use of trenches and mines were also published for such armored vehicles as the [[M113 armored personnel carrier]], which was often devastating to VC formations when first introduced.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\nThe NVA/VC forces did not only study the technology of their enemies but their operations as well, looking for weaknesses to exploit. American activities were sometimes left unmolested so vulnerable patterns could be identified and analyzed. American \"surround and pound\" tactics for example could sometimes be predictable. At the Battle of Ong Thanh for example, heavy American airstrikes were called in to hit a bunker complex, which was then predictably followed by US \"mop up\" operations the next day. The American \"mop up\" forces fell into a deadly prepared ambush, with Viet Cong fighters inflicting heavy casualties.<ref>MacGarrigle, George L. (1998). Combat Operations: Taking the Offensive: October 1966 to October 1067. Washington D.C.: United States Army Center of Military History. p. 350-357</ref> Excessively hovering helicopters were also a tip-off as to possible landing zones. Taking predictable routes and trails also opened up ARVN/American opponents to casualties via booby traps, mines and ambushes. American air strikes were sometimes ground-marked several minutes in advance, giving People's Army units enough time to evacuate an area or prepare for ambushes. American smoke marking practices were also studied, and communist troops sometimes became adept at imitating the color-coded smoke grenades the Americans used to signal air strikes or helicopter landings.<ref>James E. Westheider. 2007. The Vietnam War. pp 146\u2013152</ref> This intensive study and exploitation never ceased, and lessons learned were disseminated to other PAVN/VC formations.\n\n===Mobility and movement===\n[[File:Vccampnetwork.jpg|thumb|left|VC camp and movement network in one SVN district, 1966\u201367.]]\n\n====Movement and area control====\nThe VC/NVA were constantly on the move, seldom staying more than 2\u20134 days in one place. Integral to mobility was elaborate camouflage and information denial procedures, such as restricting civilian movements prior to, or during an operation. Frequent rotation involved [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacking]] in a series of fortified camps. These fortified sites could also be within villages or their subsidiary hamlets.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}\n\nConstant shuttling between camps or \"nomading,\" allowed the VC and NVA to evade detection and defend themselves. Just as important however, it allowed them to control an area's people, food and other material.<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND \u2013 VIETNAM, Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, (San Francisco, JUNE 1966), pp. 1\u201324</ref> As noted above, Main Force VC and NVA typically spent only a small number of days a year fighting. Most of the time was spent in area control, which provided recruits, food and other resources. Control of an area was achieved because the moving VC/NVA formations generally kept within striking distance of the civilian population and were thus in a position to harvest intelligence, liquidate opposition, intimidate the reluctant, and enforce demands for taxes, labor and other resources.\n\nMovement procedures varied with enemy locations, terrain etc., but generally recon elements from battalions or companies met with local guerrillas or operatives to gain intelligence, map out the terrain ahead, and obtain guides as needed. Security was on a tight basis with soldiers only being informed at the last minute. A movement order was accompanied by a thorough cleanup of the area to hide traces of the unit. Trenches, foxholes and other [[fortification]]s were generally camouflaged for later reuse.\n\nOnce on the move, an advanced recon team preceded the main body. Behind the advance troops, came the combat units, Headquarters, heavy weapons, combat support soldiers and another combat element. Trailing the formation was a [[Rear guard|rearguard]] detachment. The distance between individual men was generally 5\u201310 meters \u2013 less during night movements. Complete radio silence was maintained during a movement, and strict camouflage and concealment procedures applied during day movement.\n\nRecon elements scouted the flanks and rear extensively, especially while crossing obstacles or in enemy-held areas. Most movement was at night. Integral to any movement into a camp was the use of multiple avenues of approach, avoiding predictable patterns that could be exploited by opposing forces. When making an approach march for a planned battle, a long, roundabout route was generally taken, often criss-crossing earlier movements to fool enemy surveillance.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 169\u2013190}}\n\n====Signaling and communications====\nCommunications relied heavily on field telephone and runner until the latter stages of the war when mostly conventional forces took the field. A simple signaling system via a series of gunshots was also used to communicate while moving in the jungle, with the pattern and sequence of the shots conveying meaning to other People's Army troops.<ref name=\"Prados\" /> When VC or NVA did acquire modern equipment via capture or supply, they made numerous attempts at communications deception, imitating US [[radio]] transmissions and call signs to lure US/ARVN helicopters and troops into ambushes, or redirecting artillery fire from themselves on to US/ARVN positions via bogus requests for artillery adjustment and support.<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM, \"Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No. 64: Imitative Communications Deception,\" (APO San Francisco), MAC J343 15 September 1967</ref>\n\n===Fortified camps===\n====Camp construction====\n[[File:vcnvabasecamp.jpg|thumb|right|Typical VC/NVA fortified camp. Source: US Army Platoon Leaders Handbook, 1967]]\n\nConstant movement often brought the VC fighters to vast camp networks, spread out over a wide area. Some of these movements required new construction. Others reoccupied old campsites abandoned temporarily, or prepared ahead of time as part of the movement rotation. Even brief stops whether in the field, jungle or village required digging of combat trenches and foxholes. Campsites had several characteristics:<ref name=\"US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam 1967 pp. 1\u201344\">US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" (US Army: October, 1967), pp. 1\u201344</ref>\n* Defense in depth\n* Extensive use of camouflage\n* Mutually supporting defensive networks\n* Restricted avenues of approach\n* Escape routes\n* Use of tunnels, bunkers, communication trenches and foxholes\n\nAlso important was the requirement that the chosen location be within a single night's march of another camp. Special attention was paid to avenues of approach and withdrawal. VC and NVA battalions moved independently within their own sectors and along their own routes. A typical battalion might rotate between 20 and 25 campsites, all within a nights march of 3\u20134 other camps. While a US or ARVN attack might force them to fight, the primary mission was area control.\n\nThe standard camp was roughly circular and consisted of 2-lines of fortification, incorporating individual fighting positions, bunkers and trenches. Semi-permanent or permanent base camps contained more elaborate fortification ([[Viet Cong and PAVN battle tactics#Defensive tactics|Defensive tactics]]). A typical VC/NVA battalion generally spread out its companies at one-hour intervals across an area, balancing the need for quick dispersal with opportunity to concentrate as needed.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=150\u2013168}}\n\nCamps were not necessarily in remote areas. They were often situated near hamlets, or even within them \u2013 with troops taking shelter in individual houses if the village was fully dominated by the guerilla forces. After digging in, telephone wire was run, units positioned and contact made with other surrounding [[military]] formations \u2013 especially [[militia]] and guerrilla fighters. These local units were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main Force element came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover. Mines and booby traps were also planted along likely avenues of approach.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}\n\n====Camp life and morale====\n[[File:NguyenVanBe.jpg|thumb|upright|1966 NLF Poster celebrating dead hero Nguyen Van Be for killing many Americans. Be was actually a defector to the GVN who surfaced later in the year, astonished to read of his reputed exploits and death.<ref>Robert W. Chandler, War of Ideas \u2013 The U.S. Propaganda Campaign in Vietnam, A Westview Special Study, Boulder, CO, 1981</ref>]]\nLife in camp followed the military routines common to all armies, including early morning reveille, weapons training, building fortifications, duty details assigned individuals and groups, and daily strength and readiness reports required of officers. Typical of all communist armies, a large bloc of time was devoted to \"study sessions\" where troops were indoctrinated and \"criticism and self-criticism\" administered. The exploits of outstanding fighters against the enemy were widely publicized and men were urged to emulate them.\n\nFood supplies were, like those of other armies, designed to keep the troops at a certain level of activity rather than be tasty. VC/NVA fighters received a daily cash allowance for food which they might sometimes use in local markets. They also foraged widely including hunting. Lacking refrigeration, most food was prepared fresh. Rice was the staple. The ingenious [[Hoang Cam stove|''Hoang Cam'' stove]] was used to prepare meals without flame or smoke being detected, incorporating a long exhaust trench that allowed smoke to gradually disperse into the jungle far away from the actual stove.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 150\u2013168}}\n\nRecreation was provided by well organized troupes of actors and musicians when feasible, unit papers and radio broadcasts. As in all things, these were monitored by Party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] to ensure the proper line was disseminated. Medical care was difficult and austere in wartime conditions, and medicines and facilities lacking, nevertheless the highly organized system provided a rudimentary level of care to injured fighters, with field hospitals sometimes located in tunnels, caves and underground bunkers.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 150\u2013168}}\n\n===Defensive tactics===\nVC/NVA defensive doctrine generally stressed avoidance of extended battle. Unless an enemy sweep, or patrol provoked an engagement, communist forces generally lay low until they were ready to initiate their own actions. If an engagement ensued, the typical approach in terms of defense was to delay opposing forces and withdraw as soon as possible, while inflicting maximum casualties before withdrawal. Massive US \"search and destroy\" sweeps for example, while of unmistakable value in area denial, dispersal of opponents etc., yielded mixed results in the face of such avoidance tactics.\n\nThe biggest such operation, \"Operation Junction City\" in 1967 for example, involving some 22 US battalions and 4 ARVN counterparts, and supported by massive air and artillery firepower, only yielded an average of approximately 33 enemy dead per day, over its 2 months. Such losses were manageable by an opponent that could put tens of thousands of staunch fighters in the field, and reinforce them with more every day. Even more telling, such massive sweeps failed to cripple their targets and deliver the big battles sought by the Americans. The option of initiating contact was still largely in the hands of [[Communist]] units, and their tactics lured powerful US forces away from populated areas, their key base until late in the war.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|171\u2013192|date=November 2012}}\n\nA key part of the avoidance defensive pattern also involved the intensive use of fortifications and mines. Both served to enable Front forces to escape for another day's fighting, while running up the enemy tab in blood and treasure.<ref name=\"Rottman\">Gordan L. Rottman, Viet Cong and NVA Tunnels and Fortifications of the Vietnam War (Osprey: 2006) pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n\n====Defensive layouts: the two-belt system====\n[[File:Vcfortifications2.jpg|thumb|Detailed view of tunnel complex including facilities for medical care (far left)]]\n\nDefensive positions had to be prepared every time VC/NVA troops moved to a new destination, with an eye to the suitability of terrain, camouflage and withdrawal routes. Generally a two line system of fortifications was used, about 50\u2013200 meters apart. The lines were typically shaped like an L, U or V to enhance interlocking fields of fire. Individual L-shaped fighting positions were also dug, with bunkers at right angles covered with thick logs and about 2 feet of dirt. Shallow trenches connected many individual bunkers and positions into each belt of the 2-line system. The bunkers provided cover from inevitable US artillery and air attack, and the fighting positions allowed crossfire against infantry assaults. The second line of defense was not visible from the first line of positions, and allowed the fighters to fall back, either to escape a heavy bombardment, to continue retreating or to furnish a rallying point for counterattack.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nIn villages the VC and NVA followed the same 2-belt approach, placing defenses so they were integrated with village homes and structures. This took advantage of some US [[Rules of engagement|Rules of Engagement]] limiting or delaying the use of heavy weapons in inhabited areas. Another benefit of embedding defenses among civilians was that atrocities could be charged if civilian structures were hit by US or ARVN fire. Numerous dummy positions were also constructed to draw ARVN and American fire. In more remote areas, defensive fortifications were more elaborate, sometimes incorporating a third belt of defenses with stronger bunkers and trench systems. US attacks against such tough positions sought to avoid US casualties by relying upon firepower.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=33-56 }}\n\nIn some circumstances Front fortifications did not follow the layout scheme described above. Bunkers and fighting holes were scattered more widely to delay attackers, and create the psychological impression that they were surrounded on all sides. Lookout posts were often positioned on key trails, routes and likely US helicopter landing zones. To enhance their mobility during a defensive battle, numerous air-raid shelters, bunkers and trenches were pre-built in advance around an area of operations. This involved an enormous amount of labor but proved their value in maneuvering under ARVN/US attacks.<ref name=\"Rottman\" /> Foxholes dug by VC troops during the victorious [[Battle of Ap Bac]] are testimony to the insurgents almost religious dedication to field fortifications. The holes were dug so deep that a man could stand inside. Excavation of dirt was from the rear, hiding telltale traces of the digging. Only a direct hit by an artillery shell or bomb could kill troops inside such holes. Behind the line of foxholes, the Viet Cong utilized and improved an irrigation ditch, allowing them concealed movement, communication and transmission of supplies on foot or by sampan. Most of these fighting positions were invisible from the air.<ref>Mark Moyar. 2006. Triumph Forsaken: the Vietnam War, 1954\u20131965. Cambridge University press, 182\u2013277</ref>\n\n====Booby traps and mines====\n[[File:vcminemarkers2.jpg|thumb|right|VC 'scatter-site' mining and booby traps inflicted significant casualties. Typical marking methods for friendly forces included broken sticks, saplings or groups of pebbles<ref>from: US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" (US Army: October, 1967), p 26-30</ref>]]\n\nBooby traps and [[Land mine|mines]] caused immense psychological pressure on US and ARVN troops and also inflicted numerous casualties. By 1970 for example, some 11% of fatalities and 17% of injuries inflicted on US troops were caused by booby traps and mines.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p=33-56 }} Identified by a variety of markers for friendly forces, these devices slowed operations, diverted resources towards security and clearance activity, damaged equipment and poisoned relations between soldiers and the surrounding civilian population.\n\n=====Booby traps=====\nBooby traps ranged from the simple to the complex. Non-explosive traps included the well-known sharpened [[Punji stick|''punji'' stake]] coated in excrement, and mounted on sapling triggers and placed in shallow, covered pits. Stakes were deployed where infantry would walk or fling themselves to avoid attack such as roadside trenches, or behind logs. One of these devices was to injure a future Chairman of the US [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] \u2013 [[Colin Powell]].<ref>Karen De Young, Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell, (Alfred Knopf: 2006), pp. 60\u201375</ref> Another type of trap was a spiked mud ball that swung down on its victim after a trip wire release, impaling him. Other impalement devices included bamboo whips and triggered sapling spikes. Bows with poisoned arrows were also used.\n\nExplosive booby traps were also employed, some command detonated by hidden observers. They ranged from single bullet [[Cartridge Trap|cartridge traps]], to grenades, to dud bombs and shells. Anti-vehicle traps ranged from mines to buried artillery rounds. Helicopter traps were often deployed in trees surrounding a potential landing zone, triggered by an observer, or the rotor's wash. Booby traps were also made from American and ARVN trash in the field. Discarded ration cans, for example, were loaded with grenades that had pins pulled partially \u2013 the other end connected to tripwire. The sides of the can held the pin in place until the tripwire was activated. Discarded batteries and communications wire was also used \u2013 the batteries hooked to the waste wire, providing an ignition current to spark the charge of dud or discarded mortar/artillery rounds.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 33-56}}\n\n=====Mines: the VC substitute for artillery=====\nMines caused even more damage than booby traps. According to one US Army history:\n\n\"The enemy employed \"nuisance mining,\" that is, scattering mines throughout an area rather than in well-defined minefields, on a scale never before encountered by U.S. forces. Mines and booby traps were usually installed at night by trained personnel who had detailed knowledge of the terrain. Through ingenious techniques in mine warfare, the Viet Cong successfully substituted mines and booby traps for artillery.\n\n<blockquote>Instead of conventional [[minefield]]s covered by fire, the enemy hindered or prevented the use of supply roads and inhibited off-the-road operations by planting explosive devices in indiscriminate patterns. While he benefited directly by causing combat casualties, vehicle losses and delays in tactical operations, equally important was the psychological effect. Just the knowledge that a mine or booby trap could be placed anywhere slowed combat operations and forced allied troops to clear almost the entire Vietnam road net every day.<ref>{{cite |first= Lieutenant General John H (Jr) |last=Hay |title=Tactical and Materiel Innovations CMH Pub 90-21 |series=US Army, Vietnam Studies |publisher=Department of Army |location= Washington D.C. |year=2003 |origyear=1974 |url= https://history.army.mil/html/books/090/90-21/index.html <!-- |LoC=72-600390 --> |page={{page needed|date=November 2017}} }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Hugging techniques, timings, counterattacks and withdrawals====\n[[File:Pavnattack.jpg|thumb|NVA troops 1967]]\nThe VC/NVA fighters sought to neutralize US and ARVN firepower by \"hugging\" enemy troops (Vietnamese: ''N\u1eafm th\u1eaft l\u01b0ng \u0111\u1ecbch m\u00e0 \u0111\u00e1nh'')\u2014fighting so close that artillery or aircraft strikes had to be restrained for fear of friendly fire casualties.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfZLePtF_uk&index=4&list=PLaB7EsZA6jvcYKVhtS_HOOX2F1g7VsbD5&t=0s|title=The Vietnam War, Episode Three: The River Styx (January 1964 \u2013 December 1965)|publisher=PBS|time=1:44:35 | access-date = 2018-09-08}}</ref> This tactic was created by General [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh]]<ref>{{Ch\u00fa th\u00edch web|url=http://tapchiqptd.vn/vi/tim-hieu-truyen-thong-quan-su/su-sang-tao-trong-tu-duy-quan-su-cua-dai-tuong-nguyen-chi-thanh/9760.html|title=S\u1ef1 s\u00e1ng t\u1ea1o trong t\u01b0 duy qu\u00e2n s\u1ef1 c\u1ee7a \u0110\u1ea1i t\u01b0\u1edbng Nguy\u1ec5n Ch\u00ed Thanh | access-date = 2018-09-08}}</ref> after the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] in November 1965. Vigorous counterattacks were also made, particularly against weaker ARVN formations. Typically, VC/NVA troops in a defensive or ambush position held their fire or maneuvered until US troops were very close before opening fire. This initiated the \"hug\" method. Since their enemies would generally draw back upon contact and rely on supporting fires, front troops moved with them, \"hanging on the belt.\"<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nActions against enemy forces were often initiated in the latter part of the day, with impending nightfall providing favorable conditions for withdrawal. When surrounded, the Main Force VC and especially the NVA fought tenaciously, but usually with an eye towards withdrawal. Great efforts were made in recovering bodies, a psychological warfare measure that denied opponents the satisfaction of viewing enemy dead.\n\nInvariably, VC and NVA units sought to withdraw if conditions were unfavorable, and camps and base areas were abandoned without sentiment if they became untenable. Rearguard detachments, mined routes, and diversionary attacks formed part of the retreat. The existence of cross-border sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam, where US ground troops could not follow greatly aided safe withdrawal of Communist formations.<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" />\n\nThere was a withdrawal scheme for all operations whether defensive or offensive. Escape and exit routes were pre-planned and concealed in advance, with later regrouping at a planned assembly point. Common techniques for withdrawal included the following:<ref>US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam, Handbook: \"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics\", (US Army: October, 1967), p 1-44</ref>\n* Fragmenting\u2014splitting up in small groups when under attack, especially when trying to break through an encirclement.\n* Dispersing\u2014generally used when discovered. VC/NVA troops disperse, sometimes dropping packs to delay enemy forces who stop to inspect them.\n* Hiding\u2014VC/NVA troops spent a massive amount of time constructing fortifications and hiding places. Withdrawal movements frequently utilized these hideouts, often deep tunnel networks.\n* Deceiving\u2014conducting diversionary attacks to deceive and draw away enemy forces and thus facilitate the withdrawal.\n* Delaying\u2014use of rearguard units to delay pursuing forces. Delay units were sometimes used to set up enemy forces for an ambush, where the pursued turned on their pursuers.\n\n====Defensive measures against US aircraft====\nWhile their American opponents enjoyed air superiority, PAVN forces continuously challenged them, deploying an impressive array of ordnance to liquidate enemies from the air. The sophisticated missile defense system built with Soviet and Chinese assistance is well known, but PAVN made extensive use of anti-aircraft guns and even volume firing by ordinary soldiers. At the lowest level, one study noted that PAVN gunners were trained to use small arms against all types of aircraft, and special firing cells were established that could shoot up to 1000 rounds in 3 to 5 seconds at fast-moving jets. The volume of such firepower made life hazardous at the low levels for US planes, forcing them to move to higher altitudes, where the specialized anti-aircraft cannon took over. Special \"bait\" areas, ringed with hidden anti-craft batteries were also established to lure US aircraft. Barrage firing of many guns, mixed at various levels was also sometimes effective. Sensitive areas, such as Hanoi, were the most heavily defended. Most US aircraft losses were caused by heavy automatic weapons and 14mm, 35mm 57mm and 85mm anti-aircraft guns. Flak batteries forced some US aircraft even higher, where they would be within reach of the deadly SA-2 missile batteries. Positioning automatic weapons at treetop level also aided in the struggle against US helicopters. Air losses were to cause a dip in the morale of American pilots, some of whom felt they were being called to risk their lives against targets of relatively little value. Appeals to US Defense Secretary McNamara to remove restrictions on more lucrative targets were often drastically pared down or vetoed. The inability of US airpower to take a decisive toll on communist forces is testimony not only to US failures, but to the tenacity of the ordinary PAVN soldier in direct combat with aerial enemies and in the massive effort spent in constructing sophisticated fortifications and tunnel systems.<ref>JACOB VAN STAAVEREN. 2002.

When surrounded by superior air-mobile forces communist troops often fought delaying actions until nightfall, facilitating a breakout in the darkness. Special units were sometimes tasked to probe US encirclements for weak spots.]]\nUS forces sometimes employed sophisticated airmobile tactics, using integrated helicopter landings, artillery support, and troop insertions to surround enemy contacts and close off escape routes. The outstanding mobility of the helicopter made this possible, and these versatile machines could be sent into action in several configurations (troop transport, gunship, med-evac, heavy lift and supply). Helicopters allowed transport and deployment of infantry, artillery, medical, and supply elements to almost any location, presenting a formidable instrument that enhanced American and ARVN operations. When combined with other aerial elements such as fixed wing air support this combat power was multiplied, and opened up a whole new dimension of operational maneuver.<ref>Ira A Hunt, 2004. Ninth Infantry Division In Vietnam, p. 61-78</ref> But helicopters also had several vulnerabilities. They required a vast and expensive \"logistical tail\" of maintenance, fuel, munitions and bases. No nation except the US could afford such expense- fielding some 12,000 machines in Vietnam, almost half of which were shot down or lost due to accidents.<ref>Martin Van Creveld. 2011. The Age of Airpower, 379-400N</ref> The ability of helicopters to move men and material anywhere was impressive but also meant US and ARVN troops in some instances were heavily dependent on them. Destruction of the helicopter lifeline could derail an operation or maneuver, and the need to air-transport men and material to remote locations meant every new arrival of medevac, supply, transport or troop flights gave the VC/NVA yet ''another'' opportunity to cripple missions and machines. Helicopters were also very vulnerable to heavy machine guns, light AA artillery, portable SAMs like the Soviet Strela, and even concentrated small arms fire. According to some historians of airpower (Van Creveld 2011), costs were sometimes not commensurate with gains, and US airmobile operations might boil down to hugely expensive machines and their support systems chasing a handful of teenagers or second-string militiamen armed with cheap rifles.<ref>Martin Van Creveld. 2011. The Age of Airpower, 379\u2013400</ref>\n\n=====Anti-guerrilla sweeps in populated areas=====\nDuring anti-guerrilla sweeps, by some US units like the Ninth Infantry Division, contact was first established with VC/NVA forces via air or foot patrol, or planned raids on locations identified by intelligence sources. Usually conducted in daytime at the brigade level, planned strikes would allocate artillery and helicopter assets to battalions tasked with the fight. Artillery elements positioned firebases early to create an umbrella of steel over the proposed zone of battle. Helicopter assets were assigned and divided into 3 segments- light scout helicopters for reconnaissance, heavily armed gunships for firepower, and larger \"slicks\", or troop transports for the infantry. The force commander, sometimes in a helicopter, was in constant communication with all elements via rUHF, FM and field radio as needed.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\">Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61\u201365</ref>\n\nAs the American operation commenced, light scout helicopters flew ahead of the strike force at low level to detect opponents or draw their fire. Above the scouts, the helicopter gunships would lurk, ready to pounce on enemy movement, fire or fortifications. Behind and below the gunships came the \"slicks.\" These transport choppers would sometimes carry \"people sniffer\" technology designed to detect chemical traces or fumes left from human waste, smoke or sweat- indicators that Communist troops might be hiding nearby. People sniffing often required steady low altitude flying to improve reliability of results. Once VC/NVA were detected, hiding places might be saturated with tear gas. If flushed out, the enemy was attacked by the gunships, and the transports began to land infantry to surround the target and seal off escape routes. Artillery firebases would then begin their fires to smash the opposition, bombard exit routes and provide cover for the American infantry. US troops on such operations did not usually drive home attacks with direct assault, but sealed the enemy in a ring, while he was worked over by artillery and gunship strikes. Fixed-wing aircraft were on call if needed. This \"surround and pound\" approach substituted metal for men, and lowered US casualties, but in turn caused massive noncombatant civilian casualties.<ref>Christian G. Appy. 2016. American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity p. 178-183</ref>\n[[File:Helicopter airassault jitterbug.jpg|thumb|9th Infantry division troops on airmobile operation- 1969\u2013 Mekong Delta]]\nCommunist forces deployed several countermeasures against the American tactics. Avoidance and concealment was a primary method- sometimes made more difficult by the \"sniffer\" technology. But chemical detection was not always reliable- and could be thrown off by the use of animal decoys, urine bucket diversions, or was affected by wind, rain and other factors. VC/NVA units also built their fortifications in the high brush along canal banks and streams- providing a route of easier escape from the American attack. These locations could be a double-edged sword: they gave clear fields of fire against American infantry but the adjacent rice paddies sometimes created convenient enemy landing zones, and the water escape routes could become bottlenecks.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/> Pre-built fortifications and trenches helped shield the communist forces from annihilation as the ring closed in, and previously prepared ground, laced with booby-traps also delayed enemy forces. If there was enough advance warning, VC/NVA forces would prepare kill zones near or in likely landing spots. Trees could also make effective defensive positions. Booby traps were laid on trails and rice paddy dikes, and in jungle growth in a random pattern, and often caused multiple casualties to American troops.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/>\n\n[[File:Operation Dewey Canyon map.jpg|thumb|Fast-moving airmobile operations in Operation Dewey Canyon confronted NVA regulars.]]\nThe primary tactic after being surrounded was to delay until nightfall, after which breakouts would begin. Large formations were broken down into smaller units to facilitate escape and a rendezvous was pre-planned in advance. Special units were deployed to probe the encirclement, looking for weak points, and decoy units were held ready for action to occupy American forces once the breakouts began. Breakouts could be made with diversions while bodies of troops slipped away, or strength could be concentrated on a weak spot, providing enough local superiority to penetrate the American encirclement and disperse. Escaping units would link up later at designated marshaling points.<ref name=\"Hunt, Ninth Infantry, 61-65\"/> Harassment and diversionary tactics also paid dividends. As noted by some airpower historians, relatively small bodies of local fighters armed with inexpensive rifles, could divert and tie down expensive and massive allocations of men, material and time deployed by more sophisticated opponents.<ref>Van Creveld 379\u2013400</ref>\n\nIronically, the very efficiency and convenience of firebases, could at times aid VC/NVA forces. In some areas, US troops, often used as \"bait\" to draw out an enemy response, developed \"firebase psychosis\"- a reluctance to move too far away from the covering artillery of their firebases. As a result, combat movement and operational flexibility was hampered, and more mobile communist forces attacked, broke contact, maneuvered around and eluded their opponents. Many firebases were also totally dependent on helicopters for construction, resupply and evacuation, and communist attacks against these fortresses could at times force their abandonment.<ref>John Martin Carroll, Colin F. Baxter. eds. 2007. The American Military Tradition: From Colonial Times to the Present. p 253-255</ref>\n\n=====Main force confrontation=====\nVC/NVA forces also faced American airmobile attacks in remoter areas, around their base camps and border sanctuaries. In these encounters NVA regulars and VC main-force units confronted their opponents, which sometimes included airlifted ARVN elements. Typically, such airmobile operations involved preparation of fire support bases, carved out of jungle terrain. Suitable areas (usually on high ground) were selected and heavily bombarded with artillery and airstrikes, then US engineers and security troops landed to commence construction of fortifications, bunkers, artillery emplacements and helicopter landing pads. The ability of helicopters to transport all the needed men and heavy equipment to almost any location gave American arms tremendous power and flexibility.<ref>Lt. Gen John Tolson, 1989, Airmobility: 1961\u20131971, US Army Vietnam Studies</ref> Several of these firebases could be built relatively quickly and deliver devastating mutually supporting supporting fire within a combat zone. Under the artillery umbrella, Marine and army infantry deployed for combat. The versatility of helicopters enabled such forces to be resupplied and maneuvered to numerous points on the field of battle. Firebases could also be \"leapfrogged\" or shifted in response to an advance or operational needs.<ref>Albert Conord, General Raymond Davis and the Principles of War. Monograph, Command and Staff College Marine Corps University, Quantico. 2002)</ref>\n\nAgainst such methods the NVA/VC uses a variety of approaches. If the objective was to cause attrition, NVA regulars would sometimes fight directly with their opponents using conventional tactics, particularly on the DMZ against the US Marines, and in remote border areas near Laos and Cambodia. Such attrition objectives were sometimes part of the North's overall strategy of drawing the Americans into remote areas, and away from key population clusters dominated or contested by the Viet Cong.<ref name=\"Davidson\">Davidson, Philip Davidson (1988). Vietnam at War: The History, 1946\u20131975. pp316-415</ref> Some American postwar memoirs comment favorably on the bravery and tactical discipline of the NVA in these encounters.<ref>Jim Brown, 2004. Impact Zone: The Battle of the DMZ In Vietnam, 1967\u20131968, pp. 74\u2013158</ref> To stem an advance from airmobile enemies NVA troops sometimes held their ground in prepared fortifications, buying time for their comrades to maneuver elsewhere. PAVN forces also attempted with limited success to attack the quickly constructed firebases from which the lethal firepower issued. Gaps between maneuvering US units were infiltrated and attacks mounted. Ambushes were also executed. Another tactic was fighting close to US units, so close that deadly American firepower from fixed bases was discouraged for fear of hitting their own troops.<ref>Impact Zone, 100\u2013174</ref> Tactical airstrikes in support of ambushed Americans units, were also met by well-timed PAVN pullbacks from the contact zone.<ref>The American Military Tradition p 253-255</ref> If things were going badly, PAVN forces withdrew to cross-border sanctuaries, where American ground forces were forbidden to follow. The fast-moving US operations, where there was no time for the usual months of communist initiative and rehearsed preparations, could catch PAVN off-guard, and casualties against US forces could be heavy. In Operation Dewey Canyon for example, US after-action reports claim some 1,617 NVA killed, for a loss of 121 marines killed, and the capture of hundreds of tons of munitions, equipment and supplies.<ref>The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military, Spencer C. Tucker ed. 2011, pp 290\u2013293</ref>\n[[File:Chinnook chopper delivers captured rice.jpg|thumb|Workhorse of heavy lift and firebase construction- the [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]]]]\nAgainst ARVN opponents, PAVN had greater success. In the ARVN Lam Son operation into Laos, ARVN troops were inserted by helicopter, covered by US airmobile, road advance operations and massive aerial firepower. The operation met heavy resistance, including intense antiaircraft fire. ARVN air insertions took them to the outskirts of Tchepone, but numerous helicopters were shot down or damaged. PAVN flanking tactics and ambushes also mauled the ARVN infantry battalions. US/ARVN reports claimed some 13,000 PAVN deaths and destruction of tons of material, but the ARVN was forced to withdraw, a maneuver that turned into a humiliating rout, salvaged only by unrelenting American airpower. Some 105 US helicopters were lost and an additional 615 damaged. The communist base area at Tchepone was back in business within a week. The vital role of sanctuary areas which could be developed in depth into strong bases was again illustrated.<ref>The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: pp 290\u2013293</ref>\n\n=====Protracted war and staying power=====\nAmerican airmobile tactics caused substantial casualties to the VC and NVA in thousands of such confrontations, but the communist strategy of attritional, protracted war, aided by plentiful manpower, was designed to absorb these losses, while wearing down their opponents over time. Successful air-mobile tactics also failed to address what happened after the mobile force and their helicopters departed. The population was often still left unsecured, subject once more to communist control, intimidation and infiltration. GVN/ARVN follow-up action might continue to be ineffective. Cross-border sanctuary routes were still open, and the bulk of the networks of tunnels, base camps and fortification honeycombing a region usually survived. Once their opponents had left, communist forces eventually regrouped, replaced their losses, and returned.<ref>Krepinevich, Andrew F., Jr. (1986). The Army and Vietnam, pp135\u2013274.</ref>\n\n===Offensive tactics: doctrine and planning===\nIn offensive operations, the VC/NVA typically sought to wear their opponents down by thousands of small attacks, each one gradually reducing enemy strength. Winning and holding specific blocks of territory was not as important as wearing down the enemy in accordance with [[Mao Zedong#War|Mao's]] dictum: ''\"To win territory is no cause for joy, to lose territory is no cause for sorrow.\"''<ref>On Guerrilla Warfare, by Mao Tse-tung, 1937, See the text of Mao's work online at www.marxists.org</ref> Bigger set-piece assaults on installations and bases as well as ambushes were sometimes executed, but the general pattern was one of protracted, attritional warfare, conducted by relatively small formations over a wide area. This meant absorbing large numbers of casualties, but both manpower and time were plentiful.\n\n[[File:Vcnvaattack2-med.jpg]]\n\n====Attack planning====\nPlanning for attacks was a careful, deliberate process, that could take many months. Below is an outline of some considerations and actions involved.{{sfn|Lanning|Crag|1993|p= 179\u2013190}}\n\n'''Attack criteria and approval:''' The political dimensions of the attack were carefully considered, such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials. Planning involved a coordinated effort by military and [[logistics]] staff and the all-important political operatives, the party cadres who had the last word. Proposals for an operation were first sent up the chain of command. Depending on the scale of the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.\n\n'''Preliminary recon:''' If approved for further study, [[reconnaissance]] teams would case the area, analyzing political, logistics and military issues. Information gleaned from informers and sympathizers was joined to data from direct reconnaissance via patrols, infiltration or probing attacks. The analysis was comprehensive, and might involve size and composition of enemy forces, avenues of approach and withdrawal, civilian morale, hit lists of suspected traitors or troublesome dissenters who did not support the Revolution, available civilian labor to support logistics, detailed location of individual walls, ditches or fences and a host of other factors, both political and military.\n\n'''Rehearsals for the attack:''' If the objective was deemed feasible along political and military lines, detailed planning for the actual operation began, including construction of sand tables, and string and stick mock-ups of the target. Main Force or regular units tasked with the assault were selected and rehearsed. Each phase of the attack was carefully reviewed and rehearsed, including actions before opening fire, actions during fire, and actions taken upon withdrawal. Numerous postponements and changes might be undertaken until conditions and preparations were judged right to launch the assault.\n\n'''Logistics and security:''' Logistics formations might prepare coffins, pre-position medical or porter teams, and carefully tabulate the amount of ammunition needed for the operation. Guerrilla elements and laborers began to move supplies and material forward to support the impending battle. Security surrounding the operation was usually very tight with units only being informed at the last feasible moment.\n\n'''Echelons of attack:''' Depending on the complexity of the attack, numerous sub-divisions might be involved. Local guerrillas might conduct certain preliminary tasks, such as diversionary attacks, or clearance or denial (via mining, booby traps etc.) of certain areas for movement purposes. [[Sapper#PAVN and Viet Cong|Sappers]] might be tasked with opening the assault via infiltration and demolition of key objectives. A main force might swing into action once the sappers commenced their action. A blocking force might be deployed to ambush relief troops rushing to the battle area.\n\n====Attack doctrine: \"one slow, four quick\"====\nThe discussion on VC/NVA offensive methods below is adapted from ''Bernard B. Fall, Street without Joy; Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg, Inside the VC and the NVA; and [[United States Army Center of Military History]]: Vietnam Studies''<ref>Bernard B. Fall, Street without Joy, (Publisher: Stackpole Books: 1954, rev 1994), pp. 22\u2013174; and Michael Lee Lanning and Dan Cragg, Inside the VC and the NVA, (Ballantine Books, 1993), pp. 179\u2013190; and US Army, Center of Military History: Vietnam Studies, (\nDEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., 1989)</ref>\n\n[[File:Battleofsouicut.jpg|thumb|right|Some VC attacks were repulsed with heavy losses. A battle sketch of a 4-pronged VC attack against the US [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] at Soiu Cut, 1968 is shown here <ref name=\"25th Inf 1968\">25th INFANTRY DIVISION, \"Battle of Soui Cut,\" Vol 3 No. 04, TROPIC LIGHTNING NEWS, January 22, 1968</ref>]]\n\nAttacks were invariably characterized by adherence to the principle of 'one slow, four quick' \u2013 a doctrine which prevailed in both attack and defense. In offensive operations the 'quick attack' was further broken down to incorporate 'three strongs' \u2013 strong fight, strong assault and strong pursuit. Presented in sequence the doctrine can be summarized as follows:\n\n'''Slow Plan''' \u2013 This involved a steady but low-key logistical build up in forward supply areas, being positioned ahead of the fighting forces to make a solid base for the operation. The degree of planning and preparation necessary to undertake a large operation could take as long as 6 months and often included numerous 'rehearsals'.\n* '''Quick Advance''' \u2013 This was a rapid movement forward, generally after a circuitous approach march meant to confuse the enemy. Once all the units in the operation were on track, a quick advance was usually made in small and inconspicuous groups to a forward staging area from where the attack would be launched.\n* '''Quick Attack''' \u2013 Here the attacking forces would be concentrated at the weakest point of the target as identified by prior reconnaissance. The duration of an attack could often be measured in minutes. Surprise was essential and large volumes of fire were poured on the target. Phase 2 of the attack involved the '''three strongs''':\n\n::* ''Strong fight'' \u2013 an attempt to achieve and exploit the element of surprise\n\n::* ''Strong Assault'' \u2013 against a pre-arranged position using concentration of force, effort and mass to overwhelm the defense.\n\n::* ''Strong pursuit'' \u2013 the attacking force's reserves would be committed to exploit the breaches in the targets defenses so as to deliver a decisive blow\n* '''Quick Clearance''' \u2013 The attacking force would rapidly re-organize and police the battlefield so as to remove weapons and casualties and was pre-planned to prevent confusion on the objective\n* '''Quick Withdrawal''' \u2013 Involved a quick egress from the battle area to a pre-arranged rendezvous point where the attackers would again break down into smaller groups to continue their dispersal.\n\n====Anatomy of an attack: Lima Site 85 Radar station \u2013 Laos 1968====\n[[File:Tacanraid.jpg|thumb|right|Tactical map of attack on Lima 85 radar site. NVA regulars, special forces and local guerrillas collaborated in the assault.]]\n\nThe careful methods of PAVN forces are illustrated in the successful attack against the US Air Force's TACAN radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered too tough to assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on [[Echelon formation|echelon]] of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted the rest of the mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.\n\nA full after-action report by PAVN was translated in 1986 and along with other US reports, furnishes numerous details about offensive tactics.<ref>US Air Force, Translation entitled \"Raid On the \"TACAN\" Site Atop Pha-Thi Mountain..\" [People's Army of Vietnam Publishing House], Hanoi, 1996. Air Force translation \u2013 Robert J. Destatte, 11 May 1997 and 7 April 1998.; weblink: {{cite web |url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/april2006/0406lima.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121192421/http://www.afa.org/magazine/April2006/0406lima.asp |archivedate=2007-11-21 }}, and http://limasite85.us/do_chi_ben.htm</ref> These include extensive preliminary recon and rehearsals, vetting and clearance by Communist Party operatives, numerical superiority at the point of attack (3,000 versus 1,000), a secure advance to the objective (avoiding or hiding from civilian traffic), detailed sub-division of tasks for each assault element, rapid movement once the battle began, and cooperation between special forces (sappers), regulars, and local guerrillas. This operation did not involve the typical quick withdrawal however. The attackers dug in on the site and defended it against counterattack, a pattern that occurred when the VC/NVA wanted to inflict maximum casualties, or achieve some political or propaganda objective, or control a particular area.\n\nIn this case, the radar station helped guide US bombers \u2013 including the devastating B-52s, and its capture was also a strong propaganda bonus demonstrating Communist strength in Laos to the local peoples. The base was isolated and superior forces could be concentrated on it, maximizing chances for success \u2013 a key consideration in a VC/NVA offensive operation. The raid also illustrated another method of neutralizing US airpower- attack its support facilities and bases on the ground. Subsequent attempts by Royal Laotian forces to retake the area were only partially successful. The mountain peak was never recaptured.<ref>US Air Force- translation \"Tacan Raid..\" Destatte 1967</ref>\n\n===Ambush techniques===\n[[File:vchelicopterfight2.jpg|thumb|right|The VC/NVA prepared the battlefield carefully. Siting automatic weapons at treetop level for example helped shoot down several US helicopters during the Battle of Dak To, 1967 <ref>Terrence Maitland, A CONTAGION OF WAR: THE VIETNAM EXPERIENCE SERIES, (Boston Publishing Company), 1983, p. 180</ref>]]\n\nThe terrain for the [[ambush]] had to meet strict criteria:\n* provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air\n* enable ambush force to deploy, encircle and divide the enemy\n* allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire\n* enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy\n* permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal\n\nOne important feature of the ambush was that the target units should 'pile up' after being attacked, thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the [[kill zone]] and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires. Terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy. The terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force, or which offered some protection to the target, was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre-registered for mortars.\n\nThe NVA/VC ambush formations consisted of:\n* lead-blocking element\n* main-assault element\n* rear-blocking element\n* observation posts\n* command post\n\nOther elements might also be included if the situation demanded, such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement.\n\nWhen deploying into an ambush site, the NVA first occupied several observation posts, placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using, its strength and firepower, as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander. Usually one main OP and several secondary OP's were established. Runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the OP's and the main command post. The OP's were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options. Frequently the OP's were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security. The command post was situated in a central location, often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site.\n\nReconnaissance elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300\u2013500 meters away. Sometimes a \"leapfrogging\" recon technique was used. Surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other. As the enemy drew close to the first, it fell back behind the last recon team, leaving an advance group in its place. This one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap, and the cycle rotated. This method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points, and allowed the recon groups to cover one another.<ref>RAND Corp 1967, p. 3\u2013195.</ref>\n====Ambush considerations====\n[[File:Attackrehearsal.jpg|thumb|right|Careful rehearsals marked attack preparations. Here a sand table model of an objective is studied.]]\n\nThe size and sophistication of an ambush varied from hasty meeting engagements, to full scale, carefully planned, regimental sized ambushes that included forces sufficient to encircle the enemy in the kill zone. In instances where smaller units didn't have enough troops to stage a complete five-element ambush they would set up one of the preferred ambush types and avoided close assaulting the enemy.\n\nThe preferred time for ambushes was just before dark. Enemy units were often deliberately delayed by the deployment of small patrols or snipers which harassed it. Roads and bridges to the rear of the enemy unit would also be sabotaged or mined to prevent withdrawal. This limited the enemy's use of air support and the deployment of reinforcements. It often also resulted in the ambushed unit being pinned in place for the night and having to set up a defensive perimeter in a hostile area.\n\nAll ambushes, in keeping with universal ambush doctrine, were intended to inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and to allow the ambushing force to withdraw before effective fire could be returned.\n\n====Ambush types====\nThe NVA/VC favored seven types of ambushes; Mine, Bloody Nose, Flank, L-shaped, Maneuver, V-shaped, and Z-shaped. The following discussion is adapted from the MACV monograph (''Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, 1966)''<ref>UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE COMMAND \u2013 VIETNAM, Counterinsurgency Lessons Learned No 60, (San Francisco, JUNE 1966), pp. 1\u201314</ref> and from the US Army's Handbook: (''\"What A Platoon Leader Should Know about the Enemy's Jungle Tactics,\" 1967'')<ref name=\"US Army, Combined Intelligence Center-Vietnam 1967 pp. 1\u201344\"/>\n\n'''Mine Ambush. '''\nThis depended on the use of command-detonated mines which were triggered by hidden troops who held a detonating device connected to the demolitions by electrical wire. Mine ambush kill zones might also include punji traps or other homemade traps, land mines and natural obstacles. However, the ambush was always triggered by electrically detonating a mine, when enemy troops moved within the mine's killing range.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:KhS8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|VC/NVA operations generally aimed for heavy numerical superiority at the point of attack, whether in ambush or an assault operations]] -->\n\n'''Bloody Nose Ambush. '''\nUsed by small units against larger enemy forces as a means of harassment, delay and disruption. By positioning the ambush to [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] an avenue of approach, the NVA/VC obtained more effective results. Minefields, mantraps and booby traps were placed along both sides of the trail and perpendicular to it. As the enemy unit came under fire and attempted to maneuver right or left to close with the ambushers, the protective barriers would inflict casualties. As soon as the ambushing element realized that the enemy had advanced into, and taken casualties from, the mine/trap line, the ambushers withdrew to another pre-selected site where they might repeat the maneuver.\n\n'''Flank or Linear Ambush. '''\nThis was one of the simplest to set up and operate and was most commonly used by the NVA. It was also easy to get into and away from quickly. The ambush position was laid parallel to the target area. Mines or other obstacles were placed on the other side of the ambush site. Upon command, fire was brought to bear on the kill zone from multiple, overlapping firing positions. The linear ambush pumped bullets into the flank of a surprised enemy column.\n\n'''The 'L' Ambush. '''\nL-shaped ambushes included the most effective aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so that at least one machine gun could fire straight down the kill zone, enfilading it. Parallel to the kill zone and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.\n\nThe 'L' shaped ambush could also provide its own flank security. The base of the 'L' might be placed along either flank of the ambush position, not to fire into the kill zone, but to ambush enemy units that were attempting to flank the main ambush position along obvious avenues of approach.\n\nIn some situations the enemy located a reserve unit in line with the vertical bar of the 'L' forming a 'T' ambush. After the ambush was sprung, the enemy maneuvered his reserves to block the enemy line of withdrawal. The reserves either close assaulted or set up another ambush along the first linear obstacle to the immediate rear of the kill zone.\n\n'''The Maneuver Ambush. '''\nThis was usually directed against a road bound column of vehicles. The NVA/VC usually sprang it from high ground, near a bend in the road, which allowed cover and longer fields of fire for automatic weapons. Weapons frequently opened fire from positions within forty yards of the road or less.\n\nA road bend was included in the kill zone so that the end of the column was out of sight of the head of the column when the ambush was sprung. Interruption of a column's front-to-rear line of sight increased the likelihood that the head and tail of the column would split and try to fight separately.\n\nThe ambush was initiated by a small element striking the head of an enemy column and stopping it by fire. Then the main body would attack the column from the rear and/or flank, fragmenting it and rolling it up. The two strikes were timed close enough together so that the target column was engaged from both ends before it could deploy and face toward either danger.\n\n'''The 'V' Ambush. '''\nPositioned with its open mouth toward the enemy advance, this was a favorite of the VC. It was used in both fairly open terrain as well as jungle. The ambushers, in good concealment along the legs of the 'V', would wait until the enemy point had passed and then creep close to the trail. The 'V' ambush was virtually undetectable by enemy point or flank security until at least a portion of the enemy force was in the kill zone. Enfilading fire was often directed down the enemy axis of advance, and interlocking fire from each leg across the 'V'. The 'V' ambush also lent itself to the use of controlled mines and booby traps.\n\n'''The 'Z' Ambush. '''\nUsually laid along a road, the 'Z' ambush was both effective and confusing to the unit being ambushed. This complicated ambush was usually well planned with low bunkers lining the kill zone, often prepared months prior to the ambush. The ambush position was only occupied after word was received that an enemy battalion or larger unit would be using the road, which passed through the ambush site.\n\nThe long end of the 'Z' ambush was located on one side of a trail or road enabling the ambushers to employ both enfilading and flanking fire. It was also placed to neutralize attempts to flank the ambush from nearly every direction. Ambushing units deployed along the two short ends of the 'Z' could fire in either direction. The 'Z' ambush was dangerous to ambushers because ambush elements could easily fire into each other.\n\n====\"Bait\" tactics in ambush and harassment encounters====\n[[Image:Spider hole.png|left|150px|thumb|Spider holes were used both offensively and defensively]]\n\n=====VC/NCA \"bait\" tactics=====\nNumerous VC/NVA actions were quick, harassment affairs- firing a few mortar or artillery rounds and then disappearing. But others involved detailed planning and execution. These offensive and defensive tactics often involved luring ARVN and US troops into a maze of concealed fortifications, or into ambush positions, where they could be bled before the People's Army Forces withdrew. Initial positions were sometimes made to appear deliberately weak, including unmanned bunkers and light sniper-type resistance to bait enemy forces inside the killing zone. In the meantime, more lethal elements maneuvered and concentrated inside the fortified complex to inflict maximum damage.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\">Military Operations; Vietnam Primer \u2013 Dept of the Army, 1967 by Brig.Gen. SLA Marshall (Ret.) & Lt.Col. David Hackworth (Ret.) Al Baker, Commander B Co, 4/9 Inf, RVN '67 \u2013 '68</ref> Less elaborate than the fortified bunker complexes were individual \"spider holes\" \u2013 one-man excavations, some 2 feet wide by 4\u20135 feet deep, with a vegetation-covered lid, carefully camouflaged to be invisible from the air, or even foot-infantry several yards away. One US Marine memoir describes 12 such spider holes strung along both sides of a road, covered with grass and then dirt. As a US convoy passed, the NVA popped out of these hideaways and opened fire, pinning down the entire column. Supporting mortars behind the spider holes hammered the trapped Americans for several hours before the NVA pulled out.<ref>Jim Brown. 2004. Impact Zone: The Battle of the DMZ In Vietnam, 1967\u20131968, p. 70</ref>\n\n[[File:Nvarpgteam.jpg|thumb|right|NVA troops- 1968]]\nJungle terrain offered ideal environments for such methods, but ambushes and harassment tactics were also used in civilian areas. Firing a few rounds and withdrawing could not only lure enemy troops into a trap based on civilian structures but could also induce US/ARVN forces to unleash hasty [[artillery]] and tactical air strikes after relatively token provocation. This created excessive destruction in the built up areas and helped radicalize the populace against the US/ARVN troops.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\" />\n\nBait tactics exploited the US focus on [[Body count#Vietnam War|body counts]] and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and Interdiction (H&I) fire.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|180\u2013211|date=November 2012}} One related method was to occupy a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline on the perimeter of the hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians they were supposed to be protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" />{{rp|57\u2013126|180\u2013213|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother VC/NVA variant was to let a few advance scouts show themselves briefly to US formations, hoping to lure them forward into a prepared trap. Since US forces were often eager for contact and body counts, this gambit was sometimes successful. One war history for example records the astonishment of an American unit that followed these lures, when above them, they observed what appeared to be the tree canopy moving. The \"moving trees\" turned out to be camouflaged VC recon elements that signaled for the trap to be sprung from entrenched bunkers, machine guns, and assault elements that hit the Americans from three sides, inflicting heavy casualties before pulling out.<ref>[[David Maraniss]], 2003. [[They Marched into Sunlight]], p 529-601</ref>\n\n=====American use of \"bait\" tactics=====\n\n[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001 (colorized).jpg|thumb|right|U.S. troops on field operation]]\nAmerican forces also ran their own version of bait tactics, hoping to turn the tables on opponents and increase kill ratios. Whether based on airmobile or more ground oriented \"search and destroy\" missions, this approach involved using small bodies of US troops as \"bait\" \u2013 inviting communist forces to attack them, after which air and artillery firepower, and follow-on forces held in reserve would presumably crush the attackers. Such tactics were heavily used to obtain the most valued metric- a high body count of enemy. According to US Major General William E. DePuy, commander of the 1st Infantry Division: ''\"The game in the jungle is to send in a small force as bait, let the enemy attack, and be able to react with a larger force in reserve nearby. But if the enemy doesn't want to fight, then the jungle goes off in 360 directions.\"''<ref>Gregory Daddis, 2011. No Sure Victory. p 90\u2013113</ref> American superiority and speed in bringing massive quantities of firepower to bear greatly aided this approach and at times, caused heavy communist casualties. However it also put tremendous psychological pressure on the small groups of US soldiers dangled as \"bait\" before the opposing VC/NVA, who continually whittled down American strength and morale with mining and booby traps, and consistently ambushed US formations in the field.<ref>Daddis, p90\u2013113</ref> In these encounters, as in the war as a whole, Communist forces still controlled the overall initiative of when and where to strike. Per one historian:\n\n<blockquote>For the individual soldier serving as \"bait,\" the unpredictable nature of search-and-destroy missions took a heavy psychological toll. Constant fear and tension pervaded American patrols with potential threats lurking in every hamlet or rice paddy... Despite Westmoreland's emphasis on finding and killing the enemy, these patrols often consisted of long marches, a great deal of searching, and little fighting.<ref>Daddis, p95</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne US Army primer (Marshall and Hackworth 1967) on fighting Communist forces recognized some of these problems and counseled against hasty reaction fires, or careless advances on contact.<ref name=\"Marshall and Hackworth\" /> Pressure from higher commanders for body counts in pursuit of the US attrition strategy contributed to these outcomes, sometimes making a bad tactical situation worse in the view of these and other authors.<ref>Marshall and Hackworth, Military Operations; Vietnam Primer \u2013 Dept of the Army, US Army 1967</ref>\n\n====Effectiveness of ambushes====\n[[File:Ambush-vc274vs11med.jpg|thumb|right|Simplified view of VC 274th Main Force ambush against US 11th Armored Cavalry.]]\n\nAmbushes were an important part of VC/NVA offensive effort, though they could sometimes be used defensively to thwart, delay or evade an attack. Against ARVN forces they could cause tremendous damage and close vital arteries of transport. Not all ambushes were fully successful however. While VC/NVA forces typically held the initiative as to where and when to strike, US mobility and firepower sometimes blunted or dispersed their attacks. In a war of attrition however, where the clock was running on impatient US commitments, time favored Communist forces.\n\nThe encounter between the [[VC 247th Regiment|274th VC Main Force Regiment]] and the US [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment|11th Armored Cavalry]] shown in the diagram above illustrates several facets of the contending forces. The ambush took place on Highway 1, a vital road artery close to Saigon. There seems to have been careful preparation by Communist forces, including pre-built bunkers to shelter troops from US firepower along the line of retreat. A number of vehicles were destroyed but US airpower broke up the VC concentrations. A follow-up sweep by US forces killed a small number of additional VC but the bulk of them escaped.<ref>John A. Cash, John Albright, and Allan W. Sandstrum: \"Seven Firefights in Vietnam: CONVOY AMBUSH ON HIGHWAY 1, 21 NOVEMBER 1966,\" US Army, Command and General Staff College, Combined Arms Research Library, [[United States Army Center of Military History]]: Vietnam Studies, (DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY, WASHINGTON, D. C., 1985). CMH Pub 70-4 (web ref: http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/7-ff/Ch2.htmm).</ref>\n\nVC formations continually refined their techniques. At the [[Battle of Ong Thanh]] in 1967 they sprung another ambush, inflicting heavy casualties on American troops. In this encounter the VC used a variety of methods to neutralize dreaded US firepower, including \"hugging\" or fighting close to US troops. They also moved rapidly ''parallel'' to the line of ambush, sliding along its length and thus presenting a harder target for American counter-attack. While US firepower caused significant losses for the VC throughout the conflict, these methods show a force that was learning, adapting, and growing more proficient on the battlefield. Time as always, still favored Communist forces. Sanctuaries in Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam were always available, forbidden to US ground attack. Inevitably, the ARVN and Americans would have to move on. The VC and NVA regrouped and returned.<ref>Maraniss, David, They Marched into Sunlight: (Simon & Schuster, 2004){{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sapper attacks===\n====Sapper organization====\n[[File:nvasapper.jpg|thumb|Sappers were elite assault troops used by both NVA and VC Main Force units. Their speciality was attacking fixed positions]]\n\nThe [[People's Army of Vietnam|NVA]] used special assault troops or [[sapper]]s for a wide range of missions, sometimes by themselves, or sometimes as spearheads for a main-force echelon. The Viet Cong also deployed sappers particularly after [[Tet Offensive]] losses had made large-scale attacks hazardous. Called ''dac cong'' by the Vietnamese, sappers were a force economy measure that could deliver a stinging blow. They were an elite group, especially adept at infiltrating and attacking airfields, [[Fire support base#Components during Vietnam War|firebases]] and other fortified positions. About 50,000 men served in the PAVN as sappers, organized into groups of 100\u2013150 men, further broken down into companies of roughly 30\u201336 men, with sub-divisions into [[platoon]]s, squads and cells. Specialist troops such as radiomen, medics, and explosives experts were also attached. Many were volunteers. Sappers were often assigned to larger units (regiments, divisions etc.) \u2013 carrying out attacks and recon duties, but could also be organized as independent formations. Sappers trained and rehearsed carefully in all aspects of their craft and made use of a variety of equipment and explosive devices, including captured or abandoned American munitions.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\">James F. Dunnigan, The Perfect Soldier: Special Operations, (Citadel Press: 2003), pp. 150\u2013212</ref> Sappers also carried out intelligence missions and could work undercover. One of the sappers in the spectacular 1968 Tet Offensive attack against the US Embassy for example, was once a driver to the US Ambassador.<ref>Don North, \"VC Assault on the U.S. Embassy.\" Vietnam Magazine, February 2000, pp. 38\u201347, 72.</ref>\n\n====Sapper techniques====\n'''Assault planning.''' As with most VC Main Force/PAVN operations, the general pattern of \"one slow, four quick\" was followed \u2013 slow recon and initial penetration, then fast approach, attack, clearance and withdrawal. A typical assault began with a detailed recon of the target- pinpointing bunkers, ammo dumps, command and communications centers, barracks, power generation facilities and other vital points. Data from many other sources (farmers, spies, informers etc.) was collected and added to this. Detailed mortar ranges to each target area were plotted. A mock-up of the target was created and detailed rehearsals took place. Assaults were usually planned after nightfall.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /> Signalling systems were sometimes devised using colored flares. A typical signal package by the assault teams might be as follows: red flare: area hard to get into; white flare: withdrawal; green followed by white: reinforcements requested; green flare: victory.<ref name=\"Conroy\">Michael R. Conroy,\n\"SAPPER ATTACK ON FSB CUNNINGHAM,\" URL: (http://www.foxco-2ndbn-9thmarines.com/dewey_canyon.htm). Background descriptions from The Vietnam Experience: Fighting for Time, by Samuel Lipsman and Edward Doyle. (Boston Publishing Company, 1983)</ref>\n\n'''Assault organization and formations.''' Depending on the size of the attack, sappers were usually divided into 10\u201320 man assault groups or teams, which were further subdivided into 3\u20135 man assault cells. Each was tasked with destroying or neutralizing a specific area of the enemy defense. Four echelons might be employed on a typical sapper operation. An Assault group took on the main burden of the initial penetration through the wire and other defenses. A Fire-support group might be used to lay down covering fire via [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPGs]], mortars or machine guns at key points such as when the penetration elements cleared the wire, or at a set time, or via a pre-arranged signal. A small Security group might be deployed to position themselves to ambush reinforcements that attempted to rush to the defense of the besieged area. A Reserve group might be held back to exploit success, mop up or extract their fellow soldiers if the situation began to deteriorate.<ref>United States Army Center of Military History, Vietnam Studies, \"FIELD ARTILLERY, 1954\u20131973,\" by Major General David Ewing Ott, (DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY: WASHINGTON, D.C., 1975) pp. 1\u201313</ref> Deployment of these elements depended on the target and available forces. In larger attacks, where the sappers were to lead the way, the fire support, exploitation or security roles might be undertaken by bigger echelons of regular follow-on forces which used breaches created by the sappers to conduct their operations.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /><ref name=\"Nolan\" />\n\n[[File:sapperorg.jpg|thumb|left|Sapper raiding formation]]\n\n'''Initial assault movement.''' Movement to the target area was typically by long, roundabout routes to conceal the mission and fool enemy observation.<ref name=\"Conroy\" /> Once they had reached the target, infiltrators in the advance units spread themselves around the perimeter according to their assigned tasks. Detailed prior reconnaissance helped in this effort. They strapped weapons and explosive charges to their bodies to minimize noise as they maneuvered through the outer band of fortifications, and often covered their bodies in charcoal and grease to aid movement and make detection more difficult. Barbed wire was sometimes only cut partially, with the remaining strands broken by hand to muffle the tell-tale \"snip\" of wire-cutters. [[Tripflare]]s were neutralized by wrapping their triggers with cloth or strips of bamboo carried in the teeth of the vanguard fighters. [[M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine|Claymore mines]] might be turned in another direction.\n\nA [[Take point|point man]] usually preceded each team \u2013 crawling silently through defenses, probing with his fingers to detect and neutralize obstacles, while the others followed behind. Sometimes gaps in the wire were created by tying down strands to make an assault corridor. Woven mats might be thrown over barbed wire to facilitate passage. Sappers often used [[Bangalore torpedo]]es made from blocks of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] tied to bamboo poles to blast open assault routes. Attack routes often took unexpected avenues of approach, such as through the trash pits of US [[Firebase Cunningham]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Conroy\" />\n\n'''The main attack and withdrawal.''' Based on the target and relevant military situation, some attacks proceeded mainly by stealth, with little initial covering fire until the last moment. Breaches might be created in the wire at several points, then left open while the penetration teams aligned with their objectives, and hunkered down, awaiting the hour of decision. Other strikes, particularly against heavily defended US targets used a barrage of covering fires to keep defenders penned in their positions, heads down, while the assault groups moved stealthily into position. Targets were usually hit in priority order- according to the level of danger they presented to the sapper units, or based on relevant military or political objectives. Emphasizing utmost ruthlessness in attack, the sub-doctrine of the ''\"3 strongs\"'' (surprise, concentration of force and exploitation of success) was generally followed.<ref name=\"Nolan\">Keith William Nolan, Sappers In the Wire: The Life and Death of Firebase Mary Ann, (Texas A&M University Press: 1995) pp. 23\u2013119, 200\u2013245</ref>\n\nIf discovered, the sappers often sprang up and attacked immediately. Diversionary assaults and fires were also created to screen the main sapper effort. Once the fierce fighting of the main phase was over, the pullout began. While small rearguard type elements might be left in place for delaying or diversionary purposes, withdrawal was generally a quick affair. Valuable enemy weapons and other equipment were rounded up, and the bodies of the dead and wounded were removed. Detailed after-action reports and \"self-criticism\" exercises were conducted by VC/PAVN forces, absorbing lessons learned and sharpening their skills for the next assault.<ref name=\"Dunnigan\" /><ref name=\"Nolan\" />\n\n====Examples of sapper attacks====\n[[File:Destroyed_helicopter_cuchi_1969.jpg|thumb|Sappers destroyed 9 heavy lift helicopters and damaged 3 at Cu Chi Base Camp, February 26, 1969. The base was built near terrain honeycombed with miles of NLF tunnels and hideouts and was harassed continually.

This particular action involved an apparent mix of VC and NVA elements that destroyed nine [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] heavy lift helicopters, damaged three more and blew up an ammo dump.<ref name=\"25th Inf 1969\">25th Infantry Division, 242d Aviation Company (Aslt Spt Hel) 269th Aviation Battalion (Combat) 12th Aviation Group (Combat), \"After Action Report 45\", CU CHI BASE CAMP, February 26. 1969, US Army: 1969, pp. 1\u201312, weblink: http://25thaviation.org/history/id829.htm</ref> VC sappers by some reports led the assault, with NVA providing follow-on ground or fire-support attacks. However, by 1969, most Main Force VC formations were manned by northern soldiers, and communist forces continually used shifting unit numbers to confuse ARVN and US [[order of battle]] experts,<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" /> so the VC-NVA distinction and unit designations are less than clear.\n\nPOW interrogations revealed close coordination with local guerrilla elements and informers, including provision of detailed drawings and sketches of the target area. Penetration teams achieved almost complete surprise, with the sappers cutting 10 barbed wire fences, and advancing without being detected by sentries, obstacles or patrols. A rocket attack was the signal for the sappers to go into action against the helicopters and soldiers. Aside from the aircraft, US troop losses were comparatively light (1 dead, 3 wounded versus some 30 NVA or VC dead),<ref name=\"25th Inf 1969\"/> nevertheless the incident reveals the ability of the VC/NVA to stay in the field while they rebuilt after the losses of Tet.\n\n=====Sapper attack on Firebase Mary Ann, 1971=====\n[[File:Nvasapperweapons.jpg|thumb|Weapons captured in the aftermath of sapper attack against US 46th Infantry at Firebase Mary-Ann, 1971]]\n\nThe attack against US Army [[Battle of FSB Mary Ann|Firebase Mary Ann]] in 1971 by the Main Force VC 409th Sapper Battalion, is another example of these techniques. Surprise was achieved on the objective \u2013 with many on the US side not believing the NVA would attack such a small outpost. The Firebase had seen little serious threat in the past, and was manned by 250 mostly American soldiers and some ARVN. In addition, earlier helicopter and aircraft operations at the base had touched off a number of warning [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] in the wire surrounding the complex. These had not been replaced when the attack came.<ref name=\"Nolan\" /> A mortar barrage was laid down at a set time to open the battle. This provided cover for the sappers, who were already pre-positioned far forward, to move quickly towards their objectives. They destroyed the Battalion Operations Center and a number of command posts, and created general mayhem before withdrawing when helicopter gunships arrived.\n\nThe final US toll was almost 30 dead and 82 wounded. Suspicion still lingers about this controversial attack, including charges that VC infiltrators posed as ARVN soldiers to facilitate the assault.<ref name=\"Nolan\" /> If so, the incident demonstrates the long reach of the VC intelligence services, and their sophisticated planning and execution of the assault. Several senior American commanders were relieved of duty or were reprimanded after the event. Audaciously, the VC attacked the ruins of the firebase the following day with machine gun fire. One Vietnam War historian calls this incident the \"U.S. Army's most blatant and humiliating defeat in Vietnam.\"<ref>Nolan, p. 1.</ref>\n\n=== VC/NVA use of terror ===\n{{Further|Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure#VC/NVA use of terror}}\n\n===Final victory by conventional forces===\n====Improvements in PAVN performance over the 1972 Offensive====\nAssessment of VC/NVA performance must look beyond the American interlude, and the guerrilla warfare phases to the final outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the [[Battle of Ia Drang]] in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. Their capabilities had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 [[Easter Offensive]] were remedied.\n\nIn 1972 there was distinct weaknesses in the coordination of armor, artillery and infantry, with the three fronts of advance failing to support one another satisfactorily.<ref name=\"Stacey\">{{cite |last=Stacey |first= K. |title=Armour in Vietnam: the lessons of 1972 and 1975 |journal=Defence Force Journal, Australia |issue= May/June 1980 (No.22)}}</ref> Armored forces were often committed in penny packets, with lack of effective [[infantry]] support and artillery co-operation, making them vulnerable to US and ARVN countermeasures. The logistics system was also unable to support the [[Wiktionary:tempo#English|tempo]] of full-scale conventional battle. By 1975, these weaknesses had been substantially corrected, and a sophisticated military machine attained a rapid victory. The [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] was increasingly a network of paved roads easing the logistical flow for the Offensive and tactical concentration and coordination of infantry, armor and artillery was much tighter.<ref name=\"Stacey\" />\n\nIntegral to the PAVN advance was combined infantry and armor columns, that threw ARVN opponents off balance with swift moves and rapid concentrations. Extensive use was made of the ''\"blooming lotus\"'' tactic to assault cities and towns.<ref name=\"Lamont\">{{cite |first=Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. |last=Lamont |title=Urban Warrior: A View From North Vietnam |work=Marine Corps Gazette |date=April 1999 |url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6453/uwvietnam.html |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Pentagon/6453/uwvietnam.html&date=2009-10-25+09:27:09 |archivedate=2009-10-25 }}</ref> Rather than surround them and work inward in the orthodox manner of many contemporary Western armies, PAVN mobile columns bypassed opposition on the target's perimeter, and drove inward to seize vital command and control nodes in the central areas first, before striking ''outward'' to liquidate opposition. A reserve force was held on standby to defeat counterattacks against the penetration force.<ref name=\"Lamont\" />\n\nA leap-frogging tactic was also employed to maintain momentum. Spearhead units would sometimes deploy quickly to tackle opposition, while follow-on echelons bypassed such engagements to strike deeper.<ref name=\"Stacey\" /> Infiltration units like sappers also assisted the push by seizing bridges, road junctions and other key points ahead of the main forces. Deception measures were also widely used, with diversionary operations across a broad area, and troop movements timed until the last minute, to avoid telegraphing the main points of attack. Such methods for example, enabled quick conquest of towns like ''[[Ban Me Thuot]]'' and their surrounding highways, and paved the way for further operations towards Saigon.<ref name=\"Lamont\" />\n\nTerror and panic played their part in the NVA/PAVN advance, particularly in the [[T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean|Central Highlands]] where five rapidly moving divisions overwhelmed hapless ARVN formations. During the retreat from the Highlands, massive columns of civilian refugees mingled with fleeing South Vietnamese troops. PAVN forces shelled these columns indiscriminately with mortars, rockets and artillery, killing over 100,000 civilians by some estimates, and liquidating some 40,000 out of 60,000 retreating ARVN soldiers.<ref>{{cite |first1=James S. |last1=Olsen |first2=Randy |last2=Roberts |title=Where the Last Domino Fell |location= New York |publisher= St Martin's |date=1991 |page= 259}}</ref>\n\n====PAVN as a modern, professional army====\n[[File:HCMC2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The fall of Ban Me Thuot]]\n\nThe final PAVN triumph was aided by numerous weaknesses and failures in South Vietnamese forces and leadership.<ref name=\"James\">Anthony James, The War for South Viet Nam, 1954\u20131975, (Greenwood Publishing, 2001), pp. 57\u2013206</ref> Thieu's \"hold everywhere\" strategy in the months before the Northern offensive stretched ARVN forces too thinly and withered away any central reserve.

Willbanks, Abandoning Vietnam: How America Left and South Vietnam Lost Its War, (University Press of Kansas, 2004) pp. 3\u2013280</ref>\n\nThere is often heavy concentration on the American effort and its mistakes, contradictions and strategy, but comparatively little on the Vietnamese side, save as it ties into the theme of American failure or missteps.<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\">Marc Jason Gilbert, Why the North Won the Vietnam War, (Palgrave Macmillan: 2002), pp. 83\u2013249</ref> Whatever the merits of these arguments about war coverage, it is clear that the main 8-year American interlude (albeit important) was only a relatively short one in the decades-old struggle for [[hegemony]] in the Second Indochina War.\n\n===VC/NVA battlefield performance===\nVC/NVA performance waxed and waned with the fortunes of war. Weapons and equipment at the small arms level were equal with those of their enemies, and in some categories of heavy artillery they also achieved parity. The struggle against US bombing saw deployment of one of the most sophisticated air defence systems in the world, albeit with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance. In other categories they could not match the wide range of advanced US technology.\n\nAgainst their ARVN opponents the VC/NVA generally did well in both guerrilla and conventional warfare, and were on the verge of victory in 1965, before the American intervention. While ARVN forces achieved a number of impressive successes,<ref>Lewis Sorley, \"Courage and Blood: South Vietnam's Repulse of the 1972 Easter Offensive,\" Parameters, 29 (Summer 1999), 38\u201356</ref> they were, on balance, clearly outclassed by the PAVN armies, which suffered from weaknesses in certain areas, such as airpower and the handling of armor- illustrated particularly in the 1972 Easter Offensive.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /> Subsequent campaigns in Indochina however, illustrate a number of PAVN strengths \u2013 from the rapid victory of 1975, to the initial 1979 invasion of Cambodia which saw well coordinated [[corps]]-sized combined arms operations including an amphibious assault against the coast. PAVN strengths were also shown in its defensive operations during the 1979 [[Sino-Vietnamese War]].<ref>A Tale of Five Generals: Vietnam's Invasion of Cambodia. By: Pribbenow II, Merle L., Journal of Military History, Apr2006, Vol. 70 Issue 2, p459-486</ref>\n\n[[File:pavnlaos.jpg|thumb|right|NVA troops survey a ruined ARVN bunker, 1971]]\nAgainst US forces the record is more mixed. There were a number of successes particularly in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American strategic mobility, using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia Drang, Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than the other way round. However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, the [[linchpin]] of their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.\n\n===Elements in NLF/PAVN triumph===\n[[File:Sapper1970.jpg|right|thumb|Main Force Viet Cong Sapper \u2013 1970. After the devastating losses of Tet, sapper operations gained in importance as the VC/NVA rebuilt.]]\n\nThere are numerous keys to the final outcome of the Vietnam War. A few of these interrelated factors are summarized below:<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\"/>\n\n# '''A protracted, integrated strategy that maximized Northern strengths against the weaknesses of their Southern and American opponents.''' This was the strategy of protracted war, that tightly integrated political and military factors, and slowly weakened opposition over time by an attritional campaign. Protracted war also involved sequencing a mix of combat styles. This ranged from small-scale [[guerrilla]] attacks, to main-force battles that even when costly, atrophied enemy strength and morale. It also drew powerful US forces into peripheral areas, while allowing VC/NVA forces to control the key to any [[People's War]], the population. All these measures were keyed to political ends, and included ruthless assassination, kidnapping and sabotage efforts throughout the war. To some US soldiers who fought against the VC/NVA, like US [[Lieutenant General|Lt. General]] [[Phillip Davidson]], Chief of Military Intelligence from 1967 to 69,<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|803\u2013850|date=November 2012}} and US war historians like [[Andrew Krepinevich|Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr.]]<ref name=\"Krepinevich\" /> this strategy was a superior one in terms of [[Communist]] objectives and strengths, and American/GVN weaknesses.\n# '''Superior motivation and morale.''' Seen in terms of determination to achieve final victory in Indochina, Communist motivation and [[morale]] was superior to that of their enemies. For VC/NVA forces the conflict was not simply another costly Cold War episode but a life and death struggle spanning generations. Some northern leaders stressed the predominance of spiritual over material factors,<ref name=\"Lanning and Cragg\" /> a notion sometimes paid for with dire results and painful lessons under enemy (particularly American) firepower. Nevertheless, some scholars argue that over the course of almost two decades, both [[PAVN]] leadership and the ordinary PAVN soldier were more determined to achieve final triumph, and more willing to expend lives and treasure towards this end, than their opponents.<ref name=\"Davidson\" />{{rp|801\u2013850|date=November 2012}}<ref name=\"Marc Jason Gilbert 2002 pp. 83\u2013249\"/>\n# '''Detailed, overlapping organization backed by thorough going indoctrination.''' Historian Douglas Pike in 'Viet Cong' (1966) asserts that the closest thing to a \"secret weapon\" of the revolutionary forces was ''organization''<ref>Douglas Pike. 1966. Viet Cong: Organization and Techniques of the National Front. 33\u201359; 97\u2013133;404</ref> \u2013 tight, overlapping mechanisms of structure that enmeshed its subjects in a tight web of control. This structure included the parallel system of party control at all levels of civilian and military life, the overlapping plethora of organizations from province to village hamlet that enhanced resource exploitation, the three-man cells all troops were organized into, and the heavy use of \"criticism and self-criticism\" that pervaded all levels. One American Vietnam War historian calls the Viet Cong ''\"more disciplined and organized than nearly any insurgents in history.\"''<ref>Mark Moyar,\"The Phoenix Program and Contemporary Warfare,\"Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 47. (No. 4th Quarter 2007), pp. 155\u2013159</ref>\n# '''Logistical, military, political and diplomatic support by friendly communist nations.''' Aid from China and the Soviet Union was indispensable to the tough military machine on the ground, and the equally tenacious machine on the diplomatic and political fronts. This aid made North Vietnam dependent on their suppliers, but it was able to play one off against the other to enhance their bargaining power and maintain a stance of relative independence.<ref>Nicholas Khoo. 2011. Collateral Damage: Sino-Soviet Rivalry and the Termination of the Sino-Vietnamese Alliance. pp 20\u201375</ref> Support by communist nations also included the threat of massive Chinese intervention if the US opted to eliminate the northern regime by a conventional invasion, or threatened China itself. This threat, or perceived threat, effectively stymied that option. Though China was reluctant to confront the US directly in another Korean War style morass, it conveyed deterrent threats to the United States not only through military aid and deployment of over 300,000 supporting PLA troops in North Vietnam, but on some occasions, signaled China's readiness for action through such indirect diplomatic channels as Pakistan and Britain.<ref>Khoo, Collateral Damage, 30\u201331</ref> Some historians argue that the Chinese threat was overstated, and that Peking was more concerned with internal turmoil and the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, and was willing to tolerate US intervention ''\"as long as that intervention did not include rolling back communism in North Vietnam.\"'' This implicit guarantee of the North's survival, backed by the ultimate menace of massive Chinese action, curtailed America's full freedom of action.<ref>Jeffery Record, 1998. The Wrong War: Why We Lost in Vietnam. pp40-41</ref>\n# '''Logistical resilience, manoeuvring space and a massive manpower pool.''' The enormous, and successful Communist logistics effort in the face of devastating enemy firepower provided another key to victory. Supplied by supportive socialist allies, distribution to the battle zone, utilizing the manoeuvring space that was the Ho Chi Minh and [[Sihanouk Trail]]s was an impressive logistical feat. This vast space \u2013 encompassing parts of [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]] as well as the two Vietnams, stymied American and South Vietnamese interdiction efforts. Thorough organization and lavish expending of manpower were the skeleton and muscle of this achievement. The manpower available to communist forces in the struggle was critical. As noted above, some of this was external, with CHina providing over 300,000 troops to maintain logistical support on roads, railways, supply instillations and military facilities such as anti-aircraft batteries, and cross-border sanctuary airbases. Within South Vietnam, VIet Cong forces around the time of the Tet Offensive are estimated by some Western analysts as around 300,000 main force fighters, local guerillas and cadre.<ref>Dougan, Clark; Weiss, Stephen; et al. (1983). Nineteen Sixty-Eight. p 11-48</ref> Northern sources claims a combined total of 690,000 NVA and VC troops in place as early as 1966.<ref>Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954\u20131975. 2002, p. 78-211</ref> The exact communist Order of Battle on the ground was a matter of controversy with competing and shifting estimates between American MACV and CIA analysts, but most agreed on the huge manpower pool available to the north - with approximately 175,000 males reaching draft-age annually, and a total of 4 million draft-age males available for the war.<ref>CIA  Inteligence Memorandum, 1966, The Current status of PAVN Infiltration to South Vietnam. Central Intelligence Agency. April 9, 1966. p 3-12</ref> Such human resources were organized and maneuvered in an unrelenting struggle spanning four countries- all tied together by the Trail, or what the North called the Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n Strategic Supply Route. In terms of the tremendous effort to achieve victory at any cost, one American war historian asserts: \"''By any standard of human endeavor and achievement, what happened on the Ho Chi Minh Trail must rank high among the works of men and women.''\"<ref name=\"Prados\">John Prados, The Blood Road, p. 374</ref>[[File:Pavnbattle.jpg|thumb|right|The PAVN/NLF military effort was generally much more determined and organized than that of the ARVN.<ref>Douglas Pike. 1966.

While they absorbed severe blows at times, the VC/NVA had time on their side under the strategy of protracted conflict. Communist forces suffered some one million dead according to their own estimates <ref name=\"North\" /> but this was relative in a conflict where manpower reserves were plentiful and key allies like China were providing tens of thousands of troops to keep border supply and transport routes open. Tempo manifested itself at the local level. Except for those times when they were forced into a battle by US sweeps, or during deployment for a major operation, Communist troops spent most of their time in area control and consolidation, not fighting. Overall, they controlled the initiative \u2013 when, where and with what intensity to strike. Tempo was also a factor in the long-term struggle. Communist forces were able to meter their losses as the conflict waxed and waned \u2013 depending on the political, diplomatic and military situation \u2013 scaling back after the setbacks of Tet, and increasing effort dramatically in 1972 and 1975, when the situation looked more favorable.<ref name=\"Davidson\"/>{{rp|318|date=November 2012}}\n# '''Shrewd performance on the political and diplomatic fronts.''' Communist forces waged a number of effective propaganda and diplomatic campaigns to exploit contradictions in the camps of their enemies. One key triumph of politics (albeit backed by force of arms) was the continued use of sanctuaries in supposedly \"neutral\" countries, the cultivation of indigenous \"liberation forces\" like the [[Pathet Lao]], and the inability of their opponents to make significant inroads against these indispensable rear bases. Other triumphs included the division of American opinion ([[Wiktionary:epitome#Noun|epitomized]] in visiting American celebrities and media reports), the isolation of the Southern regime from their American backers, the \"talk-fight\" stonewalling strategy to extract maximum concessions, and perceptive calculation of the limits US leaders would observe in deploying military force.<ref name=\"North\">Edward Doyle, Samuel Lipsman, Terrence Maitland- THE NORTH: The Vietnam Experience, (Boston Publishing Company, 1986), pp. 31\u2013157</ref> Considerations of political performance must include the efficacy of ''dau tranh'' strategy in the creation and manipulation of numerous \"front\" or shell groups within South Vietnam to isolate its ruling regime, mobilize grassroots support for revolutionary aims, and encourage evasion and defection among its armed forces.<ref>Pike, Viet Cong.. 32\u201359</ref>\n# '''The ruthless determination of leaders of the revolutionary struggle.''' This includes both northerners and a heavy southern presence in the North's ruling echelons. By the time of the final victory in 1975, many of these leaders had been on the field of struggle for two decades. There was often division within this leadership. More conservative \"north-firsters\" clashed with \"south-firsters\" but ultimately, their collective determination prevailed.\n# '''Failure of the South Vietnamese leadership to develop an effective political narrative and administration.''' Some of this failure grew out of the difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, and inefficient administration. Despite these vulnerabilities however, it is also clear that millions of South Vietnamese opposed the takeover of their society by a communist dictatorship and fought resolutely against this outcome.<ref>Lewis Sorley 1999. A Better War: The Unexamined Victories and the Final Tragedy of America's Last Years in Vietnam. 1\u201317; 372\u2013389</ref> The southern regime however, could not develop a convincing political narrative and the degree of thorough political organization and mobilization to meet it, compared to their opponents. The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain.<ref>Sorley, A Better War.. 1\u201317; 372\u2013389</ref> Given a merciless civil war, ultimate settlement of the conflict was between the Vietnamese.\n#'''Corruption, incompetence and ineffective politicization of South Vietnamese military leadership.''' Southern ineffectiveness was reflected in the appointment of military leaders based on loyalty or family ties rather than professional competence, the ineffectual intertwining of officers in both military and civilian affairs, and widespread nepotism, corruption and factionalism that focused on personal agendas and profit rather than winning the war at hand<ref>Jeffrey J. Clarke. Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965\u20131973. US Govt- GPO, 1988, pg 18-24</ref>. The best ARVN units such as the Rangers, Marines, paratroops and special forces were too often unavailable for battle because they were held back by Saigon's leaders for internal political maneuvering<ref>Clarke. Advice and Support 7\u201352</ref>. PAVN/NLF military leadership was likewise heavily politicized, but in the communist case, effective management and accountable personnel were in place to fight the war to a victorious conclusion. RNAF effectiveness in combat was mixed, and often marred by incompetent higher leadership, such as the performance of General [[Hoang Xuan Lam]] (later relieved of command) during  the 1971 Laos incursion). Lower level leaders in general made a better showing, but too often lacked initiative, determination and skill under battle conditions. There were exceptions at all levels, such as Lt. General Ngo Quang Truong, and some lower level officers<ref>Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong. The Easter Offensive Of 1972. 2015,</ref> but the general pattern above fared badly against the more dedicated and efficient NVA/NLF.<ref>James, The War for South Viet Nam, 1954\u20131975, pp. 57\u2013206</ref> Even such key fundamentals as mobilizing avaliable troop strength or furnishing supplies to the front line were mired in malfeasance. Quartermaster units for example sometimes demanded bribes before furnishing fighting men with rice, ammunition, gasoline, and other material. <ref>Michael A. Eggleston. 2017. Dak To and the Border Battles of Vietnam, 1967-1968. p 151</ref> As much as 10 percent of the regular armed forces were non-existent \"ghost\" soldiers (deserters, disabled, deceased etc) who still appeared on the official rosters with leaders pocketing the extra payroll of the bogus troops.<ref>Clarke, Advice and Support, p 11-78</ref> Such weaknesses were untenable in the face of a ruthlessly determined northern enemy.\n# '''The mobilizing force of [[Marxism-Leninism]], mated to Vietnamese [[nationalism]].''' While in some ways Marxism was alien to the Vietnamese landscape, revolutionary leaders succeeded in blending it with traditional Vietnamese [[xenophobia]] and a growing modern sense of nationalism. Marxism also presented a sense of inevitable historical progress that enhanced mobilization, and included the key role of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Lao Dong]], the Communist Party of North Vietnam. These factors helped mobilise some support within South Vietnam.[[File:PAVNforces.jpg|right|thumb|PAVN troops. By the end of the conflict, they were a tough, proficient modern force, well equipped to carry out conventional operations.]]\n# '''Ability to learn and adapt.''' Against both the US and ARVN the VC/NVA demonstrated an ability to adapt on the battlefield. They learned from their mistakes and adopted tactics and measures to reduce losses. These ranged from deep tunnel systems, \"hugging\" techniques in infantry battles, widespread random mining, fast-moving sapper assaults, treetop fighting positions to foil US helicopters, deployment of new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] supplied technology like man-portable missiles, to simple avoidance of battle without overwhelming numerical superiority. The keen study of their own strengths and weaknesses through \"criticism and self-criticism,\" and the systematic distribution of \"lessons learned\" through reports and memorandum was part of this crucial learning ability, demonstrating that the NLF/PAVN were not the hapless peasants of popular lore, but a well equipped, serious and sophisticated military organization.{{sfn|RAND Corp|1967|p=3\u2013195}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[NLF and PAVN strategy, organization and structure]]\n* [[NLF and PAVN logistics and equipment]]\n* [[Strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare]]\n* [[Weapons of the Vietnam War]]\n* [[History of Vietnam]]\n* [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]]\n* [[The United States and the Vietnam War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite |author=RAND Corp |title=Insurgent Organization and Operations: A Case Study of the Viet Cong in the Delta, 1964\u20131966 |location=Santa Monica |date= August 1967 |ref={{harvid|RAND Corp|1967 }} }}\n*{{ cite |first1=Michael Lee |last1=Lanning |first2=Dan |last2=Crag |title=Inside the VC and the NVA |publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1993 |ref=harv }}\n\n[[Category:Vietnam War tactics]]\n[[Category:Guerrilla warfare tactics]]\n[[Category:Viet Cong]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLF_and_PAVN_battle_tactics"}
{"title_page": "List of schools in Ethiopia", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThis article discusses primary and secondary schools in [[Ethiopia]]. An incomplete list is included.\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\nEducation in Ethiopia was focused on mainly towards religious learning until after [[World War II]]. The government then began to emphasize secular learning to achieve national development. Free public education is provided in Ethiopia at both the primary and secondary level. Although there are many private schools in the country, most are concentrated in the [[Addis Ababa]] area and are rarely found in the more rural areas where there is a shortage of schools. Many students walk long distances to get to school both in and around the capital city.\n\nPrimary education starts at the first grade and continues to the eighth grade. All subjects are taught in all languages which are spoken in Ethiopia\u2014until seventh grade, at which point all subjects are taught in English. However, there are some schools\u2014many of them private\u2014that begin offering instruction in English at or before the first grade. By the end of eighth grade, students take a national examination which determines whether or not they may continue on to the secondary level. Failing students must repeat the eighth grade and take the national examination again until they pass it and matriculate into the ninth grade.\n\nUntil 2001, secondary education went from the ninth to the twelfth grade. But after 2001, the government changed the curriculum so that general secondary education ends at the tenth-grade level, while the eleventh and twelfth grade are considered college preparatory. At the end of tenth-grade students, take yet another national examination which determines whether or not they will be allowed to continue to pursue their educations and go on to college. Students who pass this second, national examination may decide if they want to focus in a science or arts stream. The science stream mainly consists of biology, chemistry, physics and technical drawing, while the art stream mainly consists of geography, history, civics and economics.  Students who fail at this level generally either join the general workforce or go to a private college. At the end of twelfth grade, students must take another national exam which determines their eligibility to move on to the university level. Passing students may choose between two general majors and two public university campuses.  The government then assigns each student to a specific major and campus.\n\n== List of schools ==\nThis is a list of schools in [[Ethiopia]], sorted alphabetically by location.\n\n===Addis Ababa===\n* Abaqira Academy \n* Abiot Kirs Secondary School\n* Addis Ketema Secondary School\n* School of Indiana\n* Assay School\n* Andinet International School<ref>{{dead link|date=June 2016}} {{cite web|url=http://www.etijobs.com|title=Etijobs-Jobs in Ethiopia &#124; Find Latest Jobs in Ethiopia|date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n* [http://www.educateethiopia.org/listing/ayer-tena-secondary/ Ayer Tena Secondary School]\n* Awolia Muslim Mission School\n* BeteSeb Academy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betesebacademy.com |title=Beteseb Academy |publisher=betesebacademy.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref>\n* Bethel Mekane Yesus School\n* [[Bingham Academy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binghamacademy.net |title=Bingham Academy |publisher=binghamacademy.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref>\n* British International School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bisaddis.com |title=British International School, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia}}</ref>\n* Bole Senior Secondary and Preparatory School\n* Bright Future School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightfutureschool.com|title=Welcome - Bright Future School Addis Ababa and Hawassa, Ethiopia|website=www.brightfutureschool.com}}</ref>\n* [[Cistercian Monastery]]\n* Cordova Academy\n* CyberWorld Institute of Computer Technology<ref>{{dead link|date=June 2016}} {{cite web|url=http://www.etijobs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520220105/http://amharainfo.net/|archivedate=2013-05-20|title=Etijobs-Jobs in Ethiopia &#124; Find Latest Jobs in Ethiopia|date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n*Dandii boru school,Bole\n* Ergib kindergarten, primary and High school.

An incomplete list is included.\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\nEducation in Ethiopia was focused on mainly towards religious learning until after [[World War II]]. The government then began to emphasize secular learning to achieve national development. Free public education is provided in Ethiopia at both the primary and secondary level. Although there are many private schools in the country, most are concentrated in the [[Addis Ababa]] area and are rarely found in the more rural areas where there is a shortage of schools. Many students walk long distances to get to school both in and around the capital city.\n\nPrimary education starts at the first grade and continues to the eighth grade. All subjects are taught in all languages which are spoken in Ethiopia\u2014until seventh grade, at which point all subjects are taught in English. However, there are some schools\u2014many of them private\u2014that begin offering instruction in English at or before the first grade. By the end of eighth grade, students take a national examination which determines whether or not they may continue on to the secondary level. Failing students must repeat the eighth grade and take the national examination again until they pass it and matriculate into the ninth grade.\n\nUntil 2001, secondary education went from the ninth to the twelfth grade. But after 2001, the government changed the curriculum so that general secondary education ends at the tenth-grade level, while the eleventh and twelfth grade are considered college preparatory. At the end of tenth-grade students, take yet another national examination which determines whether or not they will be allowed to continue to pursue their educations and go on to college. Students who pass this second, national examination may decide if they want to focus in a science or arts stream. The science stream mainly consists of biology, chemistry, physics and technical drawing, while the art stream mainly consists of geography, history, civics and economics.  Students who fail at this level generally either join the general workforce or go to a private college. At the end of twelfth grade, students must take another national exam which determines their eligibility to move on to the university level. Passing students may choose between two general majors and two public university campuses.  The government then assigns each student to a specific major and campus.\n\n== List of schools ==\nThis is a list of schools in [[Ethiopia]], sorted alphabetically by location.\n\n===Addis Ababa===\n* Abaqira Academy \n* Abiot Kirs Secondary School\n* Addis Ketema Secondary School\n* School of Indiana\n* Assay School\n* Andinet International School<ref>{{dead link|date=June 2016}} {{cite web|url=http://www.etijobs.com|title=Etijobs-Jobs in Ethiopia &#124; Find Latest Jobs in Ethiopia|date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n* [http://www.educateethiopia.org/listing/ayer-tena-secondary/ Ayer Tena Secondary School]\n* Awolia Muslim Mission School\n* BeteSeb Academy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betesebacademy.com |title=Beteseb Academy |publisher=betesebacademy.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref>\n* Bethel Mekane Yesus School\n* [[Bingham Academy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binghamacademy.net |title=Bingham Academy |publisher=binghamacademy.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref>\n* British International School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bisaddis.com |title=British International School, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia}}</ref>\n* Bole Senior Secondary and Preparatory School\n* Bright Future School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightfutureschool.com|title=Welcome - Bright Future School Addis Ababa and Hawassa, Ethiopia|website=www.brightfutureschool.com}}</ref>\n* [[Cistercian Monastery]]\n* Cordova Academy\n* CyberWorld Institute of Computer Technology<ref>{{dead link|date=June 2016}} {{cite web|url=http://www.etijobs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520220105/http://amharainfo.net/|archivedate=2013-05-20|title=Etijobs-Jobs in Ethiopia &#124; Find Latest Jobs in Ethiopia|date=2019-09-02}}</ref>\n*Dandii boru school,Bole\n* Ergib kindergarten, primary and High school.
