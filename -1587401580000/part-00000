{"title_page": "Norwegian cuisine", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2007}}\n{{Norwegian-people}}\n'''Jasper is awesome''' in its traditional form is based largely on the raw materials readily available in [[Norway]] and its mountains, wilderness, and coast. It differs in many respects from continental cuisine through the stronger focus on [[game (food)|game]] and [[fish]]. Many of the traditional dishes are the result of using conserved materials, necessary because of the long winters.\n\nModern Norwegian cuisine, although still strongly influenced by its traditional background, has been influenced by [[globalization]]: [[pasta]], [[pizza]], [[taco]]s, and the like are as common as [[meatball]]s and [[cod]] as staple foods, and urban restaurants offer the same selection one would expect to find in any [[western Europe]]an city.\n\n==Typical main meals==\n[[File:Norwegian.food-Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d-01.jpg|thumb|[[Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d]], an open Norwegian sandwich]]\nMost Norwegians eat three or four regular meals a day, usually consisting of a cold breakfast with coffee, a cold (usually packed) lunch at work and a hot dinner at home with the family. Depending on the timing of family dinner (and personal habit), some may add a cold meal in the late evening, typically a simple sandwich.\n\n===Breakfast (''frokost'')===\nThe basic Norwegian breakfast consists of milk or fruit juice, coffee (or more rarely tea), and [[open sandwich]]es with meat cuts, spreads, cheese or jam. Cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, and oatmeal are also popular, particularly with children, as is yogurt.\n\n===Lunch (''lunsj'')===\nUsually consisting of open-faced sandwiches. In cafeterias it is also common with salad bars, warm lunch or dairy products like yogurt and kvarg.\n\n===Dinner (''middag'')===\nNorwegians usually eat dinner around 5 PM. This is the most important meal of the day and typically includes carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and protein-rich foods such as meat or fish.\n\n===Evening meal (''kveldsmat'')===\nNorwegians usually eat supper before going to bed. This may consist of foods similar to what is prepared for breakfast.\n\n==Meat==\nPreserved meat and [[sausage]]s come in a large variety of regional variations, and are usually accompanied by sour cream dishes and flatbread or wheat/potato wraps. Particularly sought after delicacies include the ''fenal\u00e5r'', a slow-cured lamb's leg, and ''morr'', usually a smoked cured sausage, though the exact definition may vary regionally.\n\nLamb's meat and [[mutton]] is very popular in autumn, mainly used in ''[[f\u00e5rik\u00e5l]]'' (mutton stew with cabbage). ''[[Pinnekj\u00f8tt]]''\u2014cured and sometimes smoked mutton ribs that are steamed for several hours (traditionally on a bed of birch sticks, hence the name, meaning \"stick meat\")\u2014is traditionally served as Christmas dinner in the western parts of Norway. Another Western specialty is ''[[smalahove]]'', a salted, or salted and smoked, lamb's head.\n\nOther meat dishes include:\n\n'''Kj\u00f8ttkaker''' \u2013 '''Meatcakes''': rough, large cakes\u2014about the size of a child's fist\u2014of ground beef, onion, salt, and pepper\u2014generally served with ''sauce espagnol'' (''Kj\u00f8ttkakesaus'' or ''Brunsaus'' in Norwegian). Potatoes, stewed peas or cabbage and carrots are served on the side. Many like to use a jam of lingonberries as a relish. The pork version is called '''medisterkake'''.\n\n'''Kj\u00f8ttboller''' \u2013 '''Meatballs''': A rougher version of Swedish meatballs. Served with mashed potatoes and cream-sauce or ''sauce espagnole'' depending on the locality.\n\n'''Svinekoteletter''' \u2013 '''Pork Chops''': simply braised and served with potatoes and fried onions or whatever vegetables are available.\n\n'''Svinestek''' \u2013 '''Roast Pork''': a typical Sunday dinner, served with pickled cabbage (a sweeter\nvariety of the German sauerkraut), gravy, vegetables, and potatoes.\n\nAll good cuts of meat are roasted, as in any cuisine. Side dishes vary with season and what goes with the meat. Roast leg of lamb is an Easter classic, roast beef is not very common and game is often roasted for festive occasions.\n\n[[File:Cookbook-beef-stew.jpg|thumb|Lapskaus]]\n'''[[Lapskaus]]''' \u2013  stew: resembles [[Irish stew]], but mincemeat, sausages or indeed any meat except fresh pork may go into the dish.\n\n'''[[F\u00e5rik\u00e5l]]''' \u2013 mutton stew: the national dish of Norway. Very simple preparation: cabbage and mutton are layered in a big pot\nalong with black peppercorns, salt (and, in some recipes, wheat flour to thicken the sauce), covered with water and simmered until the meat is very tender. Potatoes on the side.\n\n'''Stekte p\u00f8lser''' \u2013 fried sausages: fresh sausages are fried and served with vegetables, potatoes, peas and perhaps some gravy.\n\n'''[[Syltelabb]]''' is usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from boiled, salt-cured [[pig's trotter]]. They are traditionally eaten using one's fingers, and served as a snack and sometimes served with beetroot, mustard, and fresh bread or with ''lefse'' or flatbread. Historically ''syltelabb'' is served with the traditional Norwegian ''jule\u00f8l'' (English: Christmas Ale), beer and liquor (like [[Akvavit|aquavit]]). This is because ''Syltelabb'' is very salty food.\n\n[[File:Pinnekjott.jpg|thumb|Pinnekj\u00f8tt with [[rutabaga|swede]] [[pur\u00e9e]] and [[potato]]es]]\n'''[[Pinnekj\u00f8tt]]''' is a main course dinner dish of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or mutton ribs, and this dish is largely associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]] in Western Norway and is rapidly gaining popularity in other regions as well. 31% of Norwegians say they eat ''pinnekj\u00f8tt'' for their family Christmas dinner. ''Pinnekj\u00f8tt'' is often served with pur\u00e9ed ''swede'' (rutabaga) and potatoes, beer and ''akevitt''.\n\n'''[[Smalahove]]''' is a traditional dish, usually eaten around Christmas time, made from a sheep's head. The skin and fleece of the head are torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed swede (rutabaga) and potatoes.\n\n'''[[Sodd]]''' is a traditional Norwegian soup-like meal with mutton and meatballs. Usually, vegetables such as potatoes or carrots also are included.\n\n===Game===\n[[File:Norwegian.cuisine-Reinsdyrsteik-01.jpg|thumb|''Reinsdyrsteik'' (reindeer roast)]]\nHigh cuisine is very reliant on [[Game (food)|game]], such as [[moose]], [[reindeer]] (strictly speaking not game, as nearly all Norwegian reindeer are semi-domesticated), [[mountain hare]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], [[Rock Ptarmigan|rock ptarmigan]] and [[fowl]]. These meats are often hunted and sold or passed around as gifts, but are also available at shops nationwide, and tend to be served at social occasions. Because these meats have a distinct, strong taste, they will often be served with rich sauces spiced with crushed [[juniper berries]], and a sour-sweet jam of [[lingonberries]] on the side.\n\n===Offal===\n\nOffal is eaten extensively, ''leverpostei'' (liver p\u00e2t\u00e9) being one of the most common fillings for sandwiches, along with ''sylte'' (brawn) and ''tunge'' (beef tongue).\n\n===Seafood===\nThe one traditional Norse dish with a claim to international popularity is [[smoked salmon]]. It is now a major export, and could be considered the most important Scandinavian contribution to modern international cuisine. Smoked salmon exists traditionally in many varieties, and is often served with scrambled eggs, dill, sandwiches and mustard sauce. Another traditional salmon product is ''gravlaks'', (literally \"buried salmon\"). Traditionally, ''gravlaks'' would be cured for 24 hours in a mix of sugar and salt and herbs (dill). The salmon may then be frozen or kept in a chilled area.  Since ''grav'' means \"buried\" it is a common misunderstanding that the salmon is buried in the ground, (similar to how ''rakfisk'' is still prepared). This was the case in the medieval ages because the fermenting process was important, however, this is not the case today. ''Gravlaks'' is often sold under more sales-friendly names internationally. A more peculiar Norwegian fish dish is ''[[Rakfisk]]'', which consists of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[trout]], similar to Swedish ''[[surstr\u00f6mming]]''.\n\nUntil the 20th century, [[shellfish]] were not eaten to any extent. This was partly due to the abundance of fish and the time involved in catching shellfish as compared to its nutritional value, as well as the fact that such food spoils rather quickly, even in a northern climate. However, prawns, crabs, and mussels have become quite popular, especially during summer. Lobster is, of course, popular, but restrictions on the catch (size and season) limit consumption. Lobster has become rather rare and expensive.\n\nPeople gather for ''krabbefest'', which translates to \"crab party\" feasts, either eating readily cooked crabs from a fishmonger or cooking live crabs in a large pan. This is typically done outdoors, the style being rather rustic with only bread, mayonnaise, and wedges of lemon to go with the crab. Crabs are caught in pots by both professionals and amateurs, prawns are caught by small trawlers and sold ready cooked at the quays. It is popular to buy half a kilogram of pie prawns and to eat it on the quay, feeding the waste to seagulls. Beer or white wine is the normal accompaniment.\n\nThe largest Norwegian food export (in fact the main Norwegian export of any kind for most of the country's history) in the past has been [[stockfish]] (''t\u00f8rrfisk'' in Norwegian). The Atlantic cod variety known as ''skrei'' because of its migrating habits, has been a source of wealth for millennia, fished annually in what is known as the ''Lofotfiske'' named for the island chain of [[Lofoten]]. Stockfish has been a staple food internationally for centuries, in particular on the Iberian peninsula and the African coast. Both during the age of sail and in the industrial age, stockfish played a part in world history as an enabling food for cross-Atlantic trade and the slave trade triangle.\n\nA large number of fish dishes are popular today, based on such species as salmon, cod, herring, sardine, and mackerel. Seafood is used fresh, smoked, salted or pickled. Variations on [[creaming (food)|creamed]] seafood soups are common along the coastline.\n\nDue to seafood's availability, seafood dishes along the coast are usually based on fresh produce, typically poached (fish) and very lightly spiced with herbs, pepper, and salt. While coastal Norwegians may consider the head, roe, and liver an inseparable part of a seafood meal, most inland restaurants do not include these in the meal. In [[Northern Norway]] a dish called ''m\u00f8lje'', consisting of poached fish, roe, and liver, is often considered a \"national dish\" of the region, and it is common for friends and family to get together at least once during winter for a ''m\u00f8ljekalas'' (loosely translated, \"m\u00f8lje feast\"). A number of the fish species available have traditionally been avoided (especially those perceived as scavengers, due to a fear of indirectly eating friends or family members who had died at sea) or reserved for bait, but most common seafood is part of the modern menu.\n\nBecause of industrial whaling, [[whale meat]] was commonly used as a cheap substitute for beef early in the 20th century. Consumption has been declining over time, but it is still widely available in all parts of the country and most Norwegians eat it occasionally. It is not considered controversial in Norway.\n\nOther fish dishes include:\n\n[[File:LutefiskBowl.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Lutefisk]]]]\n'''[[Rakfisk]]''' \u2013 Norwegian fish dish made from trout or sometimes char, salted and fermented for two to three months, or even up to a year, then eaten without further cooking. Rakfisk must be prepared and stored very hygienically, due to the risk of developing ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' (which causes [[botulism]]) if the fish contain certain bacteria during the fermentation process.\n\n'''[[Atlantic Cod|Torsk]]''' \u2013 Cod: poached, simply served with boiled potatoes and melted butter. Carrots, fried\nbacon, roe and cod liver may also accompany the fish.  A delicacy which is somewhat popular in Norway is ''torsketunger'', cod's tongue.\n[[File:Fish Market in Oslo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fish Market in Oslo. Fish is an important part of Norwegian cuisine]]\n\n'''[[Lutefisk]]''' \u2013 lyed fish: a modern preparation made of stockfish (dried cod or ling) or ''[[klippfisk]]'' (dried and salted cod) that has been steeped in [[lye]]. It was prepared this way as a way to preserve the fish for longer periods prior to refrigeration. It is somewhat popular in the United States as a heritage food. It retains a place in Norwegian cuisine (especially on the coast) as a traditional food around Christmas time.\n\nPreparation and accompaniment is for fresh cod, although beer and aquavit is served on the side.\n\n'''Stekt fisk''' \u2013 braised fish: almost all fish are braised, but as a rule, the larger specimens tend to be poached and the smaller braised. The fish is filleted, dusted with flour, salt and pepper and braised in butter. Potatoes are served on the side, and the butter from the pan used as a sauce or food cream is added to the butter to make a creamy sauce.\n\nFatty fish like herring and brisling are given the same treatment. Popular accompaniments are sliced and fresh-pickled cucumbers and sour cream.\n\n'''Fiskesuppe''' \u2013 fish soup: A white, milk-based soup with vegetables, usually carrots, onions, potato and various kinds of fish.\n\n'''Sursild''' \u2013 [[pickled herring]]: a variety of pickle-sauces are used, ranging from simple vinegar-\nsugar-based sauces with tomato, mustard, and sherry-based sauces. Pickled herring is served as an [[Hors d'oeuvre|hors-d'oeuvre]] or on rye bread as a lunch buffet. This dish is a popular Christmas/holiday lunch in Norway.\n\n===Curing===\nThe basic methods of curing are used: drying, salting, smoking and fermenting. Stockfish is fish (mainly cod) dried on racks, meats are dried, salt curing is common for both meats and fish. Fermenting (like sauer-kraut) is used for trout. Smoking is mainly used on the west coast as an addition to drying and salting, perhaps due to the wet climate.\n\n===Sauces and marinades===\nAlong with the rest of Scandinavia, Norway is one of the few places outside Asia where sweet and sour flavoring is used extensively. The sweet and sour flavor goes best with fish. There is also a treatment called \"graving\", literally burying, a curing method where salt and sugar are used as curing agents. Although salmon or trout are the most common, other fish and meat also get a treatment similar to ''gravlaks''.\n\n'''Sandefjordsm\u00f8r''' \u2013 a traditional butter and cream sauce typically served with fish dishes such as [[salmon]], garnished with fresh dill and peppercorn. This sauce was reputedly first concocted in [[Sandefjord]], a coastal city near Oslo, in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.norwegianamerican.com/food/sandefjordsmor-brings-salmon-to-life/ |title = Sandefjordsm\u00f8r brings salmon to life|date = 2016-04-06}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Gravlax|Gravlaks]]''' \u2013 sweet and salty cured salmon: a filleted side of salmon or trout that has been frozen for at least 24 hours to kill off [[parasite]]s, is cured with the fillet and is covered with a half-salt, half-sugar mixture, spiced with black pepper, dill and brandy, covered with cling-wrap, and cured in the refrigerator for three days, turned once a day.\n\n'''Gravet elg''' \u2013 sweet and salt-cured moose: this treatment may be used for all red meat, but works best with game and beef. It is the same procedure as for ''gravlaks'', but aquavit is often substituted for brandy, and juniper berries for dill.\n\n'''[[Pickled herring]]''': a pickle is made with vinegar, sugar, herbs and spices like dill, mustard seed, black peppercorns, onion and so on. The pickle must be acidic enough to prevent bacterial growth. Rinse, salt-cured herring is added and allowed to stand for at least 24 hours.\n\n'''Tomato pickled herring''': this pickle in a thick sauce: 4 Tablespoons tomato paste, 3 Tablespoons sugar, and 3 Tablespoons vinegar are mixed and thinned with about 4 Tablespoons water, flavoured with black pepper and bay leaf. Salt-cured herring is rinsed, cut in 1&nbsp;cm (1/3in) thick slices and a raw, sliced onion added. Let stand for at least 24 hours.\n\n==Fruit and desserts==\n[[File:Krumkaker.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Krumkaker]] is a traditional pastry ]]\nFruits and berries mature slowly in the cold climate. As a result, they are smaller with a more intense taste. Strawberries, [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[lingonberry|lingonberries]], raspberries and apples are popular and are part of a variety of desserts, as are cherries in the parts of the country where they are grown. Wild [[cloudberry]] is regarded as a delicacy. A typical Norwegian dessert on special occasions is cloudberries with whipped or plain cream. Strawberry-apple pie is also popular because of its rich flavour. [[Rhubarb]] pie (''[[Rhubarb tart|rabarbrapai]]'' in Norwegian) is another favoured dish in Norway.\n\nGerman and Nordic-style cakes and pastries, such as sponge cakes and [[Danish pastry]] (known as ''wienerbr\u00f8d'', literal translation: \"[[Vienna|Viennese]] bread\") share the table with a variety of home made cakes, waffles and biscuits. [[Cardamom]] is a common flavoring. Another Norwegian cake is [[Krumkake]], a paper-thin rolled cake filled with whipped cream. (Krumkake means 'Curved Cake' or 'Crooked Cake'). Baked [[meringue]]s are known as ''pikekyss'', literally translated as \"girl's kiss\".\n\nDuring [[Christmas]] (''jul''), the traditional Norwegian holiday season, many different [[dessert]] dishes are served including [[Jul (Norway)#Food|Julekake]], a heavily spiced leavened loaf often coated with sugar and cinnamon, and [[Multekrem]] (whipped cream with [[Cloudberry|cloudberries]]).\n\n==Breads==\n[[File:Norwegian peasant baking bread.png|thumb|A Norwegian peasant making flat-bread in the 1910s]]\nBread is an important staple of the Norwegian diet. Breads containing a large proportion of whole grain flour ('''grovbr\u00f8d''', or \"coarse bread\") are popular, likely because bread makes up such a substantial part of the Norwegian diet and are therefore expected to be nutritious. 80% of Norwegians regularly eat bread, in the form of open-top sandwiches with butter for breakfast and lunch.<ref>[http://www.sifo.no/files/file74767_fagrapport_2008-2-web.pdf SIFO (National Institute for Consumer Research) Nordmenns br\u00f8d- og kornvaner -i stabilitet og endring. p. 3, 2008]</ref> A soft flat bread called [[lefse]] made out of potato, milk or cream (or sometimes lard) and flour is also very popular.\n\nThe variety of bread available in a common supermarket is rather large: ''wittenberger'' (crisp-crusted wheat bread), ''grovbr\u00f8d'' (whole-wheat bread, often with syrup), ''loff'' (soft wheat bread), sour-dough bread and other German-style breads. Baguettes, ciabatta, bagels and so on are also popular. During the Hanseatic era, cereals were imported in exchange for fish by the [[Hanseatic League]]. Both the German Hanseatic League and the Danish colonizers influenced Norwegian cuisine, bringing continental habits, taste and produce. Norwegians are particularly fond of a crisp crust, regarding a soft crust as a sign of the bread being stale. Oat is used in addition to wheat and rye and is perhaps the most unusual cereal in bread-making as compared to continental Europe and the UK. Seeds and nuts (like sunflower seeds and walnuts) are rather common ingredients, along with olives and sun-dried pickles, to improve the texture of the bread.\n\n==Cheese==\n[[Image:Gamalost.jpg|thumb|right|Gamalost with some of the granular texture visible]]\nCheese is still extremely popular in Norway, though the variety of traditional products available and commonly in use is severely reduced. [[Norvegia]] is a common yellow cheese (produced since the 1890s) as is [[Jarlsberg cheese]] which is also known as a Norwegian export (produced since the 1850s). The sweet ''[[geitost]]'' or brown/red cheese (not a true cheese, but rather caramelized lactose from goat milk or a mix of goat and/or cow milk) is very popular in cooking and with bread. More sophisticated, traditional, or strong cheeses include the ''[[gammalost]]'' (lit. \"old cheese\"), an over-matured, highly pungent cheese made from sour milk, ''[[Pultost]]'', made from sour milk and [[caraway]] seeds, and ''[[N\u00f8kkelost]]'' flavored with [[cumin]] and [[cloves]].\n\n==Beverages==\n\n===Coffee===\nNorway has a particularly strong affinity for [[coffee]] and is the second highest consumer of coffee in the world, with the average Norwegian drinking 142 liters, or 9.5&nbsp;kg of coffee in 2011. Norway has the fourth highest per capita coffee consumption in the world<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}</ref> and it plays a large role in Norwegian culture. It is common to invite people over for coffee and cakes and to drink coffee with dessert after the main courses in get-togethers. Coffee is traditionally served black, usually in a mug, rather than a cup. As in the rest of the West, Italian-style coffee bars have become popular. Coffee is included in one of the most traditional alcoholic beverages in Norway, commonly known as ''[[karsk]]'', from Tr\u00f8ndelag.<ref name=dri>[https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/food-and-drink/drink-your-way-through-norway/ Drink your way throug Norway] www.visitnorway.com</ref>\n\n===Alcohol===\nBoth industrial and small-scale brewing have long traditions in Norway.  In recent years, microbreweries and [[craft beer|craft beer]] have become increasingly popular. Despite restrictive alcohol policies, there is a large community of brewers, and a colorful variety of beverages, some legal, some less so. The most popular industrial beers are usually pilsners and red beers (''bayer''), while traditional beer is much richer, with a high alcohol and malt content. The ancient practice of brewing ''Jule\u00f8l'' (Christmas beer) persists even today, and imitations of these are available before Christmas, in shops and, for the more potent versions, at state monopoly outlets. Cider brewing has faced tough barriers to commercial production due to alcohol regulations. The famous honey wine, ''[[mj\u00f8d]]'' (mead), is mostly a drink for connoisseurs, Norse and medieval historical re-enactors, and practitioners of [[\u00e5satru]] and other Norse neopagan religions. The climate has not been hospitable to grapes for millennia, and wines and more potent drinks are available only from the wine monopolies.\n\nDistilled beverages include ''akevitt'', a yellow-tinged liquor spiced with [[caraway seeds]], also known as [[akvavit]] or other variations on the Latin ''[[aqua vitae]]'' \u2013 water of life. The Norwegian ''linie'' style is distinctive for its maturing process, crossing the equator in sherry casks stored in the hull of a ship, giving it more taste and character than the rawer styles of other Scandinavian ''akevittar''. Norway also produces some vodkas, bottled water and fruit juices.\n\nIn rural Norway, it is still common to find ''hjemmebrent'' ([[moonshine]], literally \"home burnt\"). Even for personal consumption, it is illegal by Norwegian law to produce distilled alcohol. If the product has more than 60% alcohol by volume, it is defined as a narcotic by the law and the punishments are even harsher than for other drugs. The traditional home distiller is mostly left alone by the law enforcers, but those who produce on a larger scale and sell the product are not.<ref name=\"Tilvirkning av alkoholholdig drikk\">{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19890602-027-010.html#6-1 |title=Lovdata \u2013 Sender deg til riktig side |publisher=Lovdata.no |date=1989-06-02 |accessdate=2013-11-14 |language=no }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway beer is available in stores from 9am to 8pm on weekdays and from 9am to 6pm on Saturdays.  Wine and spirits can be bought until 6pm on weekdays and until 3pm on Saturdays in government-owned and run liquor shops ([[Vinmonopolet]]).

It differs in many respects from continental cuisine through the stronger focus on [[game (food)|game]] and [[fish]]. Many of the traditional dishes are the result of using conserved materials, necessary because of the long winters.\n\nModern Norwegian cuisine, although still strongly influenced by its traditional background, has been influenced by [[globalization]]: [[pasta]], [[pizza]], [[taco]]s, and the like are as common as [[meatball]]s and [[cod]] as staple foods, and urban restaurants offer the same selection one would expect to find in any [[western Europe]]an city.\n\n==Typical main meals==\n[[File:Norwegian.food-Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d-01.jpg|thumb|[[Sm\u00f8rbr\u00f8d]], an open Norwegian sandwich]]\nMost Norwegians eat three or four regular meals a day, usually consisting of a cold breakfast with coffee, a cold (usually packed) lunch at work and a hot dinner at home with the family. Depending on the timing of family dinner (and personal habit), some may add a cold meal in the late evening, typically a simple sandwich.\n\n===Breakfast (''frokost'')===\nThe basic Norwegian breakfast consists of milk or fruit juice, coffee (or more rarely tea), and [[open sandwich]]es with meat cuts, spreads, cheese or jam. Cereals such as corn flakes, muesli, and oatmeal are also popular, particularly with children, as is yogurt.\n\n===Lunch (''lunsj'')===\nUsually consisting of open-faced sandwiches. In cafeterias it is also common with salad bars, warm lunch or dairy products like yogurt and kvarg.\n\n===Dinner (''middag'')===\nNorwegians usually eat dinner around 5 PM. This is the most important meal of the day and typically includes carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and protein-rich foods such as meat or fish.\n\n===Evening meal (''kveldsmat'')===\nNorwegians usually eat supper before going to bed. This may consist of foods similar to what is prepared for breakfast.\n\n==Meat==\nPreserved meat and [[sausage]]s come in a large variety of regional variations, and are usually accompanied by sour cream dishes and flatbread or wheat/potato wraps. Particularly sought after delicacies include the ''fenal\u00e5r'', a slow-cured lamb's leg, and ''morr'', usually a smoked cured sausage, though the exact definition may vary regionally.\n\nLamb's meat and [[mutton]] is very popular in autumn, mainly used in ''[[f\u00e5rik\u00e5l]]'' (mutton stew with cabbage). ''[[Pinnekj\u00f8tt]]''\u2014cured and sometimes smoked mutton ribs that are steamed for several hours (traditionally on a bed of birch sticks, hence the name, meaning \"stick meat\")\u2014is traditionally served as Christmas dinner in the western parts of Norway. Another Western specialty is ''[[smalahove]]'', a salted, or salted and smoked, lamb's head.\n\nOther meat dishes include:\n\n'''Kj\u00f8ttkaker''' \u2013 '''Meatcakes''': rough, large cakes\u2014about the size of a child's fist\u2014of ground beef, onion, salt, and pepper\u2014generally served with ''sauce espagnol'' (''Kj\u00f8ttkakesaus'' or ''Brunsaus'' in Norwegian). Potatoes, stewed peas or cabbage and carrots are served on the side. Many like to use a jam of lingonberries as a relish. The pork version is called '''medisterkake'''.\n\n'''Kj\u00f8ttboller''' \u2013 '''Meatballs''': A rougher version of Swedish meatballs. Served with mashed potatoes and cream-sauce or ''sauce espagnole'' depending on the locality.\n\n'''Svinekoteletter''' \u2013 '''Pork Chops''': simply braised and served with potatoes and fried onions or whatever vegetables are available.\n\n'''Svinestek''' \u2013 '''Roast Pork''': a typical Sunday dinner, served with pickled cabbage (a sweeter\nvariety of the German sauerkraut), gravy, vegetables, and potatoes.\n\nAll good cuts of meat are roasted, as in any cuisine. Side dishes vary with season and what goes with the meat. Roast leg of lamb is an Easter classic, roast beef is not very common and game is often roasted for festive occasions.\n\n[[File:Cookbook-beef-stew.jpg|thumb|Lapskaus]]\n'''[[Lapskaus]]''' \u2013  stew: resembles [[Irish stew]], but mincemeat, sausages or indeed any meat except fresh pork may go into the dish.\n\n'''[[F\u00e5rik\u00e5l]]''' \u2013 mutton stew: the national dish of Norway. Very simple preparation: cabbage and mutton are layered in a big pot\nalong with black peppercorns, salt (and, in some recipes, wheat flour to thicken the sauce), covered with water and simmered until the meat is very tender. Potatoes on the side.\n\n'''Stekte p\u00f8lser''' \u2013 fried sausages: fresh sausages are fried and served with vegetables, potatoes, peas and perhaps some gravy.\n\n'''[[Syltelabb]]''' is usually eaten around and before Christmas time, made from boiled, salt-cured [[pig's trotter]]. They are traditionally eaten using one's fingers, and served as a snack and sometimes served with beetroot, mustard, and fresh bread or with ''lefse'' or flatbread. Historically ''syltelabb'' is served with the traditional Norwegian ''jule\u00f8l'' (English: Christmas Ale), beer and liquor (like [[Akvavit|aquavit]]). This is because ''Syltelabb'' is very salty food.\n\n[[File:Pinnekjott.jpg|thumb|Pinnekj\u00f8tt with [[rutabaga|swede]] [[pur\u00e9e]] and [[potato]]es]]\n'''[[Pinnekj\u00f8tt]]''' is a main course dinner dish of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or mutton ribs, and this dish is largely associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]] in Western Norway and is rapidly gaining popularity in other regions as well. 31% of Norwegians say they eat ''pinnekj\u00f8tt'' for their family Christmas dinner. ''Pinnekj\u00f8tt'' is often served with pur\u00e9ed ''swede'' (rutabaga) and potatoes, beer and ''akevitt''.\n\n'''[[Smalahove]]''' is a traditional dish, usually eaten around Christmas time, made from a sheep's head. The skin and fleece of the head are torched, the brain removed, and the head is salted, sometimes smoked, and dried. The head is boiled for about 3 hours and served with mashed swede (rutabaga) and potatoes.\n\n'''[[Sodd]]''' is a traditional Norwegian soup-like meal with mutton and meatballs. Usually, vegetables such as potatoes or carrots also are included.\n\n===Game===\n[[File:Norwegian.cuisine-Reinsdyrsteik-01.jpg|thumb|''Reinsdyrsteik'' (reindeer roast)]]\nHigh cuisine is very reliant on [[Game (food)|game]], such as [[moose]], [[reindeer]] (strictly speaking not game, as nearly all Norwegian reindeer are semi-domesticated), [[mountain hare]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], [[Rock Ptarmigan|rock ptarmigan]] and [[fowl]]. These meats are often hunted and sold or passed around as gifts, but are also available at shops nationwide, and tend to be served at social occasions. Because these meats have a distinct, strong taste, they will often be served with rich sauces spiced with crushed [[juniper berries]], and a sour-sweet jam of [[lingonberries]] on the side.\n\n===Offal===\n\nOffal is eaten extensively, ''leverpostei'' (liver p\u00e2t\u00e9) being one of the most common fillings for sandwiches, along with ''sylte'' (brawn) and ''tunge'' (beef tongue).\n\n===Seafood===\nThe one traditional Norse dish with a claim to international popularity is [[smoked salmon]]. It is now a major export, and could be considered the most important Scandinavian contribution to modern international cuisine. Smoked salmon exists traditionally in many varieties, and is often served with scrambled eggs, dill, sandwiches and mustard sauce. Another traditional salmon product is ''gravlaks'', (literally \"buried salmon\"). Traditionally, ''gravlaks'' would be cured for 24 hours in a mix of sugar and salt and herbs (dill). The salmon may then be frozen or kept in a chilled area.  Since ''grav'' means \"buried\" it is a common misunderstanding that the salmon is buried in the ground, (similar to how ''rakfisk'' is still prepared). This was the case in the medieval ages because the fermenting process was important, however, this is not the case today. ''Gravlaks'' is often sold under more sales-friendly names internationally. A more peculiar Norwegian fish dish is ''[[Rakfisk]]'', which consists of [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] [[trout]], similar to Swedish ''[[surstr\u00f6mming]]''.\n\nUntil the 20th century, [[shellfish]] were not eaten to any extent. This was partly due to the abundance of fish and the time involved in catching shellfish as compared to its nutritional value, as well as the fact that such food spoils rather quickly, even in a northern climate. However, prawns, crabs, and mussels have become quite popular, especially during summer. Lobster is, of course, popular, but restrictions on the catch (size and season) limit consumption. Lobster has become rather rare and expensive.\n\nPeople gather for ''krabbefest'', which translates to \"crab party\" feasts, either eating readily cooked crabs from a fishmonger or cooking live crabs in a large pan. This is typically done outdoors, the style being rather rustic with only bread, mayonnaise, and wedges of lemon to go with the crab. Crabs are caught in pots by both professionals and amateurs, prawns are caught by small trawlers and sold ready cooked at the quays. It is popular to buy half a kilogram of pie prawns and to eat it on the quay, feeding the waste to seagulls. Beer or white wine is the normal accompaniment.\n\nThe largest Norwegian food export (in fact the main Norwegian export of any kind for most of the country's history) in the past has been [[stockfish]] (''t\u00f8rrfisk'' in Norwegian). The Atlantic cod variety known as ''skrei'' because of its migrating habits, has been a source of wealth for millennia, fished annually in what is known as the ''Lofotfiske'' named for the island chain of [[Lofoten]]. Stockfish has been a staple food internationally for centuries, in particular on the Iberian peninsula and the African coast. Both during the age of sail and in the industrial age, stockfish played a part in world history as an enabling food for cross-Atlantic trade and the slave trade triangle.\n\nA large number of fish dishes are popular today, based on such species as salmon, cod, herring, sardine, and mackerel. Seafood is used fresh, smoked, salted or pickled. Variations on [[creaming (food)|creamed]] seafood soups are common along the coastline.\n\nDue to seafood's availability, seafood dishes along the coast are usually based on fresh produce, typically poached (fish) and very lightly spiced with herbs, pepper, and salt. While coastal Norwegians may consider the head, roe, and liver an inseparable part of a seafood meal, most inland restaurants do not include these in the meal. In [[Northern Norway]] a dish called ''m\u00f8lje'', consisting of poached fish, roe, and liver, is often considered a \"national dish\" of the region, and it is common for friends and family to get together at least once during winter for a ''m\u00f8ljekalas'' (loosely translated, \"m\u00f8lje feast\"). A number of the fish species available have traditionally been avoided (especially those perceived as scavengers, due to a fear of indirectly eating friends or family members who had died at sea) or reserved for bait, but most common seafood is part of the modern menu.\n\nBecause of industrial whaling, [[whale meat]] was commonly used as a cheap substitute for beef early in the 20th century. Consumption has been declining over time, but it is still widely available in all parts of the country and most Norwegians eat it occasionally. It is not considered controversial in Norway.\n\nOther fish dishes include:\n\n[[File:LutefiskBowl.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Lutefisk]]]]\n'''[[Rakfisk]]''' \u2013 Norwegian fish dish made from trout or sometimes char, salted and fermented for two to three months, or even up to a year, then eaten without further cooking. Rakfisk must be prepared and stored very hygienically, due to the risk of developing ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' (which causes [[botulism]]) if the fish contain certain bacteria during the fermentation process.\n\n'''[[Atlantic Cod|Torsk]]''' \u2013 Cod: poached, simply served with boiled potatoes and melted butter. Carrots, fried\nbacon, roe and cod liver may also accompany the fish.  A delicacy which is somewhat popular in Norway is ''torsketunger'', cod's tongue.\n[[File:Fish Market in Oslo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Fish Market in Oslo. Fish is an important part of Norwegian cuisine]]\n\n'''[[Lutefisk]]''' \u2013 lyed fish: a modern preparation made of stockfish (dried cod or ling) or ''[[klippfisk]]'' (dried and salted cod) that has been steeped in [[lye]]. It was prepared this way as a way to preserve the fish for longer periods prior to refrigeration. It is somewhat popular in the United States as a heritage food. It retains a place in Norwegian cuisine (especially on the coast) as a traditional food around Christmas time.\n\nPreparation and accompaniment is for fresh cod, although beer and aquavit is served on the side.\n\n'''Stekt fisk''' \u2013 braised fish: almost all fish are braised, but as a rule, the larger specimens tend to be poached and the smaller braised. The fish is filleted, dusted with flour, salt and pepper and braised in butter. Potatoes are served on the side, and the butter from the pan used as a sauce or food cream is added to the butter to make a creamy sauce.\n\nFatty fish like herring and brisling are given the same treatment. Popular accompaniments are sliced and fresh-pickled cucumbers and sour cream.\n\n'''Fiskesuppe''' \u2013 fish soup: A white, milk-based soup with vegetables, usually carrots, onions, potato and various kinds of fish.\n\n'''Sursild''' \u2013 [[pickled herring]]: a variety of pickle-sauces are used, ranging from simple vinegar-\nsugar-based sauces with tomato, mustard, and sherry-based sauces. Pickled herring is served as an [[Hors d'oeuvre|hors-d'oeuvre]] or on rye bread as a lunch buffet. This dish is a popular Christmas/holiday lunch in Norway.\n\n===Curing===\nThe basic methods of curing are used: drying, salting, smoking and fermenting. Stockfish is fish (mainly cod) dried on racks, meats are dried, salt curing is common for both meats and fish. Fermenting (like sauer-kraut) is used for trout. Smoking is mainly used on the west coast as an addition to drying and salting, perhaps due to the wet climate.\n\n===Sauces and marinades===\nAlong with the rest of Scandinavia, Norway is one of the few places outside Asia where sweet and sour flavoring is used extensively. The sweet and sour flavor goes best with fish. There is also a treatment called \"graving\", literally burying, a curing method where salt and sugar are used as curing agents. Although salmon or trout are the most common, other fish and meat also get a treatment similar to ''gravlaks''.\n\n'''Sandefjordsm\u00f8r''' \u2013 a traditional butter and cream sauce typically served with fish dishes such as [[salmon]], garnished with fresh dill and peppercorn. This sauce was reputedly first concocted in [[Sandefjord]], a coastal city near Oslo, in 1959.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.norwegianamerican.com/food/sandefjordsmor-brings-salmon-to-life/ |title = Sandefjordsm\u00f8r brings salmon to life|date = 2016-04-06}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Gravlax|Gravlaks]]''' \u2013 sweet and salty cured salmon: a filleted side of salmon or trout that has been frozen for at least 24 hours to kill off [[parasite]]s, is cured with the fillet and is covered with a half-salt, half-sugar mixture, spiced with black pepper, dill and brandy, covered with cling-wrap, and cured in the refrigerator for three days, turned once a day.\n\n'''Gravet elg''' \u2013 sweet and salt-cured moose: this treatment may be used for all red meat, but works best with game and beef. It is the same procedure as for ''gravlaks'', but aquavit is often substituted for brandy, and juniper berries for dill.\n\n'''[[Pickled herring]]''': a pickle is made with vinegar, sugar, herbs and spices like dill, mustard seed, black peppercorns, onion and so on. The pickle must be acidic enough to prevent bacterial growth. Rinse, salt-cured herring is added and allowed to stand for at least 24 hours.\n\n'''Tomato pickled herring''': this pickle in a thick sauce: 4 Tablespoons tomato paste, 3 Tablespoons sugar, and 3 Tablespoons vinegar are mixed and thinned with about 4 Tablespoons water, flavoured with black pepper and bay leaf. Salt-cured herring is rinsed, cut in 1&nbsp;cm (1/3in) thick slices and a raw, sliced onion added. Let stand for at least 24 hours.\n\n==Fruit and desserts==\n[[File:Krumkaker.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Krumkaker]] is a traditional pastry ]]\nFruits and berries mature slowly in the cold climate. As a result, they are smaller with a more intense taste. Strawberries, [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[lingonberry|lingonberries]], raspberries and apples are popular and are part of a variety of desserts, as are cherries in the parts of the country where they are grown. Wild [[cloudberry]] is regarded as a delicacy. A typical Norwegian dessert on special occasions is cloudberries with whipped or plain cream. Strawberry-apple pie is also popular because of its rich flavour. [[Rhubarb]] pie (''[[Rhubarb tart|rabarbrapai]]'' in Norwegian) is another favoured dish in Norway.\n\nGerman and Nordic-style cakes and pastries, such as sponge cakes and [[Danish pastry]] (known as ''wienerbr\u00f8d'', literal translation: \"[[Vienna|Viennese]] bread\") share the table with a variety of home made cakes, waffles and biscuits. [[Cardamom]] is a common flavoring. Another Norwegian cake is [[Krumkake]], a paper-thin rolled cake filled with whipped cream. (Krumkake means 'Curved Cake' or 'Crooked Cake'). Baked [[meringue]]s are known as ''pikekyss'', literally translated as \"girl's kiss\".\n\nDuring [[Christmas]] (''jul''), the traditional Norwegian holiday season, many different [[dessert]] dishes are served including [[Jul (Norway)#Food|Julekake]], a heavily spiced leavened loaf often coated with sugar and cinnamon, and [[Multekrem]] (whipped cream with [[Cloudberry|cloudberries]]).\n\n==Breads==\n[[File:Norwegian peasant baking bread.png|thumb|A Norwegian peasant making flat-bread in the 1910s]]\nBread is an important staple of the Norwegian diet. Breads containing a large proportion of whole grain flour ('''grovbr\u00f8d''', or \"coarse bread\") are popular, likely because bread makes up such a substantial part of the Norwegian diet and are therefore expected to be nutritious. 80% of Norwegians regularly eat bread, in the form of open-top sandwiches with butter for breakfast and lunch.<ref>[http://www.sifo.no/files/file74767_fagrapport_2008-2-web.pdf SIFO (National Institute for Consumer Research) Nordmenns br\u00f8d- og kornvaner -i stabilitet og endring. p. 3, 2008]</ref> A soft flat bread called [[lefse]] made out of potato, milk or cream (or sometimes lard) and flour is also very popular.\n\nThe variety of bread available in a common supermarket is rather large: ''wittenberger'' (crisp-crusted wheat bread), ''grovbr\u00f8d'' (whole-wheat bread, often with syrup), ''loff'' (soft wheat bread), sour-dough bread and other German-style breads. Baguettes, ciabatta, bagels and so on are also popular. During the Hanseatic era, cereals were imported in exchange for fish by the [[Hanseatic League]]. Both the German Hanseatic League and the Danish colonizers influenced Norwegian cuisine, bringing continental habits, taste and produce. Norwegians are particularly fond of a crisp crust, regarding a soft crust as a sign of the bread being stale. Oat is used in addition to wheat and rye and is perhaps the most unusual cereal in bread-making as compared to continental Europe and the UK. Seeds and nuts (like sunflower seeds and walnuts) are rather common ingredients, along with olives and sun-dried pickles, to improve the texture of the bread.\n\n==Cheese==\n[[Image:Gamalost.jpg|thumb|right|Gamalost with some of the granular texture visible]]\nCheese is still extremely popular in Norway, though the variety of traditional products available and commonly in use is severely reduced. [[Norvegia]] is a common yellow cheese (produced since the 1890s) as is [[Jarlsberg cheese]] which is also known as a Norwegian export (produced since the 1850s). The sweet ''[[geitost]]'' or brown/red cheese (not a true cheese, but rather caramelized lactose from goat milk or a mix of goat and/or cow milk) is very popular in cooking and with bread. More sophisticated, traditional, or strong cheeses include the ''[[gammalost]]'' (lit. \"old cheese\"), an over-matured, highly pungent cheese made from sour milk, ''[[Pultost]]'', made from sour milk and [[caraway]] seeds, and ''[[N\u00f8kkelost]]'' flavored with [[cumin]] and [[cloves]].\n\n==Beverages==\n\n===Coffee===\nNorway has a particularly strong affinity for [[coffee]] and is the second highest consumer of coffee in the world, with the average Norwegian drinking 142 liters, or 9.5&nbsp;kg of coffee in 2011. Norway has the fourth highest per capita coffee consumption in the world<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}</ref> and it plays a large role in Norwegian culture. It is common to invite people over for coffee and cakes and to drink coffee with dessert after the main courses in get-togethers. Coffee is traditionally served black, usually in a mug, rather than a cup. As in the rest of the West, Italian-style coffee bars have become popular. Coffee is included in one of the most traditional alcoholic beverages in Norway, commonly known as ''[[karsk]]'', from Tr\u00f8ndelag.<ref name=dri>[https://www.visitnorway.com/things-to-do/food-and-drink/drink-your-way-through-norway/ Drink your way throug Norway] www.visitnorway.com</ref>\n\n===Alcohol===\nBoth industrial and small-scale brewing have long traditions in Norway.  In recent years, microbreweries and [[craft beer|craft beer]] have become increasingly popular. Despite restrictive alcohol policies, there is a large community of brewers, and a colorful variety of beverages, some legal, some less so. The most popular industrial beers are usually pilsners and red beers (''bayer''), while traditional beer is much richer, with a high alcohol and malt content. The ancient practice of brewing ''Jule\u00f8l'' (Christmas beer) persists even today, and imitations of these are available before Christmas, in shops and, for the more potent versions, at state monopoly outlets. Cider brewing has faced tough barriers to commercial production due to alcohol regulations. The famous honey wine, ''[[mj\u00f8d]]'' (mead), is mostly a drink for connoisseurs, Norse and medieval historical re-enactors, and practitioners of [[\u00e5satru]] and other Norse neopagan religions. The climate has not been hospitable to grapes for millennia, and wines and more potent drinks are available only from the wine monopolies.\n\nDistilled beverages include ''akevitt'', a yellow-tinged liquor spiced with [[caraway seeds]], also known as [[akvavit]] or other variations on the Latin ''[[aqua vitae]]'' \u2013 water of life. The Norwegian ''linie'' style is distinctive for its maturing process, crossing the equator in sherry casks stored in the hull of a ship, giving it more taste and character than the rawer styles of other Scandinavian ''akevittar''. Norway also produces some vodkas, bottled water and fruit juices.\n\nIn rural Norway, it is still common to find ''hjemmebrent'' ([[moonshine]], literally \"home burnt\"). Even for personal consumption, it is illegal by Norwegian law to produce distilled alcohol. If the product has more than 60% alcohol by volume, it is defined as a narcotic by the law and the punishments are even harsher than for other drugs. The traditional home distiller is mostly left alone by the law enforcers, but those who produce on a larger scale and sell the product are not.<ref name=\"Tilvirkning av alkoholholdig drikk\">{{cite web|url=http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19890602-027-010.html#6-1 |title=Lovdata \u2013 Sender deg til riktig side |publisher=Lovdata.no |date=1989-06-02 |accessdate=2013-11-14 |language=no }}</ref>\n\nIn Norway beer is available in stores from 9am to 8pm on weekdays and from 9am to 6pm on Saturdays.  Wine and spirits can be bought until 6pm on weekdays and until 3pm on Saturdays in government-owned and run liquor shops ([[Vinmonopolet]]).

In the division semi-finals, they once again faced the Bandits, who had beaten the Rock in 2 of their 3 matchups in the regular season. With stellar goaltending performances by both Rose and former Rock goalie [[Anthony Cosmo (lacrosse)|Anthony Cosmo]], the Rock defeated the Bandits 7-6 to advance to their third straight Eastern final.\n\nThe Rock hosted the [[Rochester Knighthawks]], who had a 4-18 all-time record in Toronto and hadn't beaten the Rock in Toronto since 2008.<ref>{{cite
