{"title_page": "Examples of groups", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2015}}\nSome elementary '''examples of groups''' in [[mathematics]] are given on [[Group (mathematics)]].\nFurther examples are listed here.\n\n==Permutations of a set of three elements==\n\n[[File:Group diagram d6.svg|thumb|[[Cycle graph (group)|Cycle graph]] for S<sub>3</sub>. A loop specifies a series of powers of any element connected to the identity element (e).. For example, the e-ba-ab loop reflects the fact that ba<sup>2</sup>=ab and  ba<sup>3</sup>=e, as well as the fact that ab<sup>2</sup>=ba and  ab<sup>3</sup>=e The other \"loops\" are roots of unity so that, for example a<sup>2</sup>=e.]]\n{{main|Dihedral group of order 6}}\n\nConsider three colored blocks (red, green, and blue), initially placed in the order RGB. Let ''a'' be the operation \"swap the first block and the second block\", and ''b'' be the operation \"swap the second block and the third block\".\n\nWe can write ''xy'' for the operation \"first do ''y'', then do ''x''\"; so that ''ab'' is the operation RGB \u2192 RBG \u2192 BRG, which could be described as \"move the first two blocks one position to the right and put the third block into the first position\". If we write ''e'' for \"leave the blocks as they are\" (the identity operation), then we can write the six permutations of the three blocks as follows:\n\n* ''e'' : RGB \u2192 RGB\n* ''a'' : RGB \u2192 GRB\n* ''b'' : RGB \u2192 RBG\n* ''ab'' : RGB \u2192 BRG\n* ''ba'' : RGB \u2192 GBR\n* ''aba'' : RGB \u2192 BGR\n\nNote that ''aa'' has the effect RGB \u2192 GRB \u2192 RGB; so we can write ''aa'' = ''e''. Similarly, ''bb'' = (''aba'')(''aba'') = ''e''; (''ab'')(''ba'') = (''ba'')(''ab'') = ''e''; so every element has an inverse.\n\nBy inspection, we can determine associativity and closure; note in particular that (''ba'')''b'' = ''bab'' = ''b''(''ab'').\n\nSince it is built up from the basic operations ''a'' and ''b'', we say that the set {''a'',''b''} ''[[generating set of a group|generates]]'' this group. The group, called the ''[[symmetric group]]'' ''S''<sub>3</sub>, has [[Order (group theory)|order]] 6, and is non-abelian (since, for example, ''ab'' \u2260 ''ba'').\n\n==The group of translations of the plane==\n\nA ''translation'' of the plane is a rigid movement of every point of the plane for a certain distance in a certain direction.\nFor instance \"move in the North-East direction for 2 miles\" is a translation of the plane.\nIf you have two such translations ''a'' and ''b'', they can be composed to form a new translation ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' as follows: first follow the prescription of ''b'', then that of ''a''.\nFor instance, if \n:''a'' = \"move North-East for 3 miles\"\nand\n:''b'' = \"move South-East for 4 miles\"\nthen\n:''a'' \u2218 ''b'' = \"move East for 5 miles\"\n(see [[Pythagorean theorem]] for why this is so, geometrically).\n\nThe set of all translations of the plane with composition as operation forms a group:\n\n#If ''a'' and ''b'' are translations, then ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' is also a translation.\n#Composition of translations is associative:  (''a'' \u2218 ''b'') \u2218 ''c'' = ''a'' \u2218 (''b'' \u2218 ''c'').\n#The identity element for this group is the translation with prescription \"move zero miles in whatever direction you like\".\n#The inverse of a translation is given by walking in the opposite direction for the same distance.\n\nThis is an abelian group and our first (nondiscrete) example of a [[Lie group]]: a group which is also a [[manifold]].\n\n==The [[symmetry group]] of a square: [[dihedral group]] of order 8 {{anchor|dihedral group of order 8}} ==\n[[File:Dih4 cycle graph.svg|thumb|left|[[Cycle graph (group)|Cycle graph]] of Dih<sub>4</sub><br>''a'' is the clockwise rotation<br>and ''b'' the horizontal reflection.]]\n{| class=wikitable align=right width=360\n|[[File:Dihedral_group4_example.png|180px]]<BR>Dih<sub>4</sub>  as 2D point group, D<sub>4</sub>, [4], (*4\u2022), order 4, with a 4-fold rotation and a mirror generator.\n|[[File:Dihedral_group4_example2.png|180px]]<BR>Dih<sub>4</sub> in [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|3D dihedral group]] D<sub>4</sub>, [4,2]<sup>+</sup>, (422), order 4, with a vertical 4-fold rotation generator order 4, and 2-fold horizontal generator\n|}\n[[File:Dih 4 Cayley Graph; generators a, b.svg|thumb|[[Cayley graph]] of Dih<sub>4</sub>]]\n[[File:Dih 4 Cayley Graph; generators b, c.svg|thumb|A different Cayley graph of Dih<sub>4</sub>, generated by the horizontal reflection ''b'' and a diagonal reflection ''c'']]\n\nGroups are very important to describe the [[symmetry]] of objects, be they geometrical (like a [[tetrahedron]]) or algebraic (like a set of equations).\nAs an example, we consider a glass square of a certain thickness (with a letter \"F\" written on it, just to make the different positions discriminable).\nIn order to describe its symmetry, we form the set of all those rigid movements of the square that don't make a visible difference (except the \"F\").\nFor instance, if you turn it by 90\u00b0 clockwise, then it still looks the same, so this movement is one element of our set, let's call it ''a''.\nWe could also flip it horizontally so that its underside become up.\nAgain, after performing this movement, the glass square looks the same, so this is also an element of our set and we call it ''b''.\nThen there's of course the movement that does nothing; it's denoted by ''e''.\n\nNow if you have two such movements ''x'' and ''y'', you can define the composition ''x'' \u2218 ''y'' as above: you first perform the movement ''y'' and then the movement ''x''.\nThe result will leave the slab looking like before.\n\nThe point is that the set of all those movements, with composition as operation, forms a group.\nThis group is the most concise description of the square's symmetry.\nChemists use symmetry groups of this type to describe the symmetry of crystals and molecules.\n\nLet's investigate our squares symmetry group some more.\nRight now, we have the elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''e'', but we can easily form more:\nfor instance ''a'' \u2218 ''a'', also written as ''a''<sup>2</sup>, is a 180\u00b0 degree turn.\n''a''<sup>3</sup> is a 270\u00b0 clockwise rotation (or a 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise rotation).\nWe also see that ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''e'' and also ''a''<sup>4</sup> = ''e''.\nHere's an interesting one: what does ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' do?\nFirst flip horizontally, then rotate.\nTry to visualize that ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2218 ''a''<sup>3</sup>.\nAlso, ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2218 ''b'' is a vertical flip and is equal to ''b'' \u2218 ''a''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThis group of order 8 has the following [[Cayley table]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Then ''G'' forms a group under ordinary [[Function composition|composition]] of mappings. This group is called the [[symmetric group]], and is commonly denoted ''Sym(S)'', \u03a3<sub>''S''</sub>, or <math>\\mathfrak{S}_{S}</math>. The unit element of ''G'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] of ''S''. For two maps ''f'' and ''g'' in ''G'' are bijective, ''fg'' is also bijective. Therefore, ''G'' is closed. The composition of maps is associative; hence ''G'' is a group. ''S'' may be either finite or infinite.\n\n===Matrix groups===\n\nIf ''n'' is some positive integer, we can consider the set of all invertible ''n'' by ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over the [[real number|reals]], say.\nThis is a group with matrix multiplication as operation. It is called the '''[[general linear group]]''', GL(''n'').\nGeometrically, it contains all combinations of rotations, reflections, dilations and skew transformations of ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] that [[fixed point (mathematics)|fix]] a given point (the ''origin'').\n\nIf we restrict ourselves to matrices with [[determinant]] 1, then we get another group, the '''[[special linear group]]''', SL(''n'').\nGeometrically, this consists of all the elements of GL(''n'') that preserve both orientation and volume of the various [[geometric solid]]s in Euclidean space.\n\nIf instead we restrict ourselves to [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] matrices, then we get the '''[[orthogonal group]]''' O(''n'').\nGeometrically, this consists of all combinations of rotations and reflections that fix the origin.\nThese are precisely the transformations which preserve lengths and angles.\n\nFinally, if we impose both restrictions, then we get the '''[[special orthogonal group]]''' SO(''n''), which consists of rotations only.\n\nThese groups are our first examples of infinite non-abelian groups. They are also happen to be [[Lie group]]s. In fact, most of the important Lie groups (but not all) can be expressed as matrix groups.\n\nIf this idea is generalised to matrices with [[complex number]]s as entries, then we get further useful Lie groups, such as the [[unitary group]] U(''n'').\nWe can also consider matrices with [[quaternion]]s as entries; in this case,  there is no well-defined notion of a determinant (and thus no good way to define a quaternionic \"volume\"), but we can still define a group analogous to the orthogonal group, the '''[[symplectic group]]''' Sp(''n'').\n\nFurthermore, the idea can be treated purely algebraically with matrices over any [[field (algebra)|field]], but then the groups are not Lie groups.\n\nFor example, we have the [[general linear group]]s over [[finite field]]s.  The group theorist [[J. L. Alperin]] has written that \"The typical example of a finite group is GL(n,q), the general linear group of n dimensions over the field with q elements.

Let ''a'' be the operation \"swap the first block and the second block\", and ''b'' be the operation \"swap the second block and the third block\".\n\nWe can write ''xy'' for the operation \"first do ''y'', then do ''x''\"; so that ''ab'' is the operation RGB \u2192 RBG \u2192 BRG, which could be described as \"move the first two blocks one position to the right and put the third block into the first position\". If we write ''e'' for \"leave the blocks as they are\" (the identity operation), then we can write the six permutations of the three blocks as follows:\n\n* ''e'' : RGB \u2192 RGB\n* ''a'' : RGB \u2192 GRB\n* ''b'' : RGB \u2192 RBG\n* ''ab'' : RGB \u2192 BRG\n* ''ba'' : RGB \u2192 GBR\n* ''aba'' : RGB \u2192 BGR\n\nNote that ''aa'' has the effect RGB \u2192 GRB \u2192 RGB; so we can write ''aa'' = ''e''. Similarly, ''bb'' = (''aba'')(''aba'') = ''e''; (''ab'')(''ba'') = (''ba'')(''ab'') = ''e''; so every element has an inverse.\n\nBy inspection, we can determine associativity and closure; note in particular that (''ba'')''b'' = ''bab'' = ''b''(''ab'').\n\nSince it is built up from the basic operations ''a'' and ''b'', we say that the set {''a'',''b''} ''[[generating set of a group|generates]]'' this group. The group, called the ''[[symmetric group]]'' ''S''<sub>3</sub>, has [[Order (group theory)|order]] 6, and is non-abelian (since, for example, ''ab'' \u2260 ''ba'').\n\n==The group of translations of the plane==\n\nA ''translation'' of the plane is a rigid movement of every point of the plane for a certain distance in a certain direction.\nFor instance \"move in the North-East direction for 2 miles\" is a translation of the plane.\nIf you have two such translations ''a'' and ''b'', they can be composed to form a new translation ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' as follows: first follow the prescription of ''b'', then that of ''a''.\nFor instance, if \n:''a'' = \"move North-East for 3 miles\"\nand\n:''b'' = \"move South-East for 4 miles\"\nthen\n:''a'' \u2218 ''b'' = \"move East for 5 miles\"\n(see [[Pythagorean theorem]] for why this is so, geometrically).\n\nThe set of all translations of the plane with composition as operation forms a group:\n\n#If ''a'' and ''b'' are translations, then ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' is also a translation.\n#Composition of translations is associative:  (''a'' \u2218 ''b'') \u2218 ''c'' = ''a'' \u2218 (''b'' \u2218 ''c'').\n#The identity element for this group is the translation with prescription \"move zero miles in whatever direction you like\".\n#The inverse of a translation is given by walking in the opposite direction for the same distance.\n\nThis is an abelian group and our first (nondiscrete) example of a [[Lie group]]: a group which is also a [[manifold]].\n\n==The [[symmetry group]] of a square: [[dihedral group]] of order 8 {{anchor|dihedral group of order 8}} ==\n[[File:Dih4 cycle graph.svg|thumb|left|[[Cycle graph (group)|Cycle graph]] of Dih<sub>4</sub><br>''a'' is the clockwise rotation<br>and ''b'' the horizontal reflection.]]\n{| class=wikitable align=right width=360\n|[[File:Dihedral_group4_example.png|180px]]<BR>Dih<sub>4</sub>  as 2D point group, D<sub>4</sub>, [4], (*4\u2022), order 4, with a 4-fold rotation and a mirror generator.\n|[[File:Dihedral_group4_example2.png|180px]]<BR>Dih<sub>4</sub> in [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|3D dihedral group]] D<sub>4</sub>, [4,2]<sup>+</sup>, (422), order 4, with a vertical 4-fold rotation generator order 4, and 2-fold horizontal generator\n|}\n[[File:Dih 4 Cayley Graph; generators a, b.svg|thumb|[[Cayley graph]] of Dih<sub>4</sub>]]\n[[File:Dih 4 Cayley Graph; generators b, c.svg|thumb|A different Cayley graph of Dih<sub>4</sub>, generated by the horizontal reflection ''b'' and a diagonal reflection ''c'']]\n\nGroups are very important to describe the [[symmetry]] of objects, be they geometrical (like a [[tetrahedron]]) or algebraic (like a set of equations).\nAs an example, we consider a glass square of a certain thickness (with a letter \"F\" written on it, just to make the different positions discriminable).\nIn order to describe its symmetry, we form the set of all those rigid movements of the square that don't make a visible difference (except the \"F\").\nFor instance, if you turn it by 90\u00b0 clockwise, then it still looks the same, so this movement is one element of our set, let's call it ''a''.\nWe could also flip it horizontally so that its underside become up.\nAgain, after performing this movement, the glass square looks the same, so this is also an element of our set and we call it ''b''.\nThen there's of course the movement that does nothing; it's denoted by ''e''.\n\nNow if you have two such movements ''x'' and ''y'', you can define the composition ''x'' \u2218 ''y'' as above: you first perform the movement ''y'' and then the movement ''x''.\nThe result will leave the slab looking like before.\n\nThe point is that the set of all those movements, with composition as operation, forms a group.\nThis group is the most concise description of the square's symmetry.\nChemists use symmetry groups of this type to describe the symmetry of crystals and molecules.\n\nLet's investigate our squares symmetry group some more.\nRight now, we have the elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''e'', but we can easily form more:\nfor instance ''a'' \u2218 ''a'', also written as ''a''<sup>2</sup>, is a 180\u00b0 degree turn.\n''a''<sup>3</sup> is a 270\u00b0 clockwise rotation (or a 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise rotation).\nWe also see that ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''e'' and also ''a''<sup>4</sup> = ''e''.\nHere's an interesting one: what does ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' do?\nFirst flip horizontally, then rotate.\nTry to visualize that ''a'' \u2218 ''b'' = ''b'' \u2218 ''a''<sup>3</sup>.\nAlso, ''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2218 ''b'' is a vertical flip and is equal to ''b'' \u2218 ''a''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThis group of order 8 has the following [[Cayley table]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Without the dikes along the Hamme and the W\u00fcmme, it would be flooded twice a day.\n\nSince its cultivation in the 12th century, the Blockland is drained by a network of parallel trenches which cut the area into blocks, giving the area its name.\n\n== Population and landuse ==\nThe density of population is quite low, 14 inhabitants per  km\u00b2. The settlements are concentrated along the dike. Most of the land use is Greenland economy of pastures and meadows.<ref>[http://www.statistik-bremen.de/tabellen/kleinraum/stadt_ottab/141.htm www.statistik-bemen.de on Blockland]</ref>\n\nFor the inhabitants of Bremen, the Blockland is an important leisure resort. Cycling, hiking and skating on the small roads at the dikes and along Kleine W\u00fcmme, an affluent of the W\u00fcmme, are popular activities. The Kleine W\u00fcmme and the limiting waterways of W\u00fcmme and Kuhgraben are used for paddling. And if there is enough frost, the ancient navigation canal of Semkenfahrt becomes a natural ice-rink.\n\nThe [[garbage dump]] of Bremen City, called ''Blockland-Deponie'',<ref>[http://www.umweltbetrieb-bremen.de/sixcms/detail.php?gsid=bremen02.c.742.de Umweltbetrieb Bremen, ''Bremens h\u00f6chster Berg'' (in German)]</ref> is situated just outside the political Blockland in the territory of the borough of [[Walle, Bremen|Walle]].\n<gallery widths=180>\n1416Wasserhorst Kirchwurt.JPG|Wasserhorst parish church\nKuh im Blockland - Bremen - 2007.jpg|Typical landuse\nZweist\u00e4nderhof Blockland.jpg|Typical farmhouse on the dike\n</gallery>\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nThe oldest building of the Blockland is the tower of the evangelical parish church of Wasserhorst [[:de:Evangelische Kirche Wasserhorst|<small>'''(DE)'''</small>]]. The church was mentioned first in 1185. The tower, in a [[Romano-Gothic]] borderline style, was erected in the 13th century. The nave was remodeled in 1743. To keep them safe from inundations, the church and churchyard have been built on an [[Artificial dwelling hill|artificial hill]] ([[German language|Ger.]] Warft), here based on a natural hill that had not been high enough to be safe.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://bremen.de/politik_und_staat/334098 Ortsamt Blockland]\n{{Coord|53|08|35|N|08|48|22|E|scale:50000|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Bremen (city)]]\n\n\n{{Bremen-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Einsof", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePopulation and landuse", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockland,_Bremen"}

The genre evolved from folklore tales of a [[dunce]] or youngest child going out in the world to seek his fortune.<ref>\"Franco Moretti\u202fet John Neubauer, historiens de la litt\u00e9rature, ont tous deux insist\u00e9 sur le r\u00f4le fondamental qu\u2019a jou\u00e9 le roman, depuis la fin du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale, dans la construction des \u00e2ges de la vie, de l\u2019adolescence et la jeunesse. Si, avant cette p\u00e9riode, les jeunes sont les laiss\u00e9s-pour-compte de la litt\u00e9rature romanesque, cette entr\u00e9e tardive est compens\u00e9e par la place centrale qu\u2019ils occupent dans le roman de formation.

In a ''Bildungsroman'', the goal is maturity, and the protagonist achieves it gradually and with difficulty. The genre often features a main conflict between the main character and society. Typically, the values of society are gradually accepted by the protagonist and he or she is ultimately accepted into society\u2014the protagonist's mistakes and disappointments are over. In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\n[[Franco Moretti]] \"argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''\".<ref>Lazzaro-Weis, Carol, \"The Female 'Bildungsroman': Calling It into Question\", ''NWSA Journal'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16\u201334.</ref>\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual.

In some works, the protagonist is able to reach out and help others after having achieved maturity.\n\n[[Franco Moretti]] \"argues that the main conflict in the ''Bildungsroman'' is the myth of modernity with its overvaluation of youth and progress as it clashes with the static teleological vision of happiness and reconciliation found in the endings of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister'' and even [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''\".<ref>Lazzaro-Weis, Carol, \"The Female 'Bildungsroman': Calling It into Question\", ''NWSA Journal'', Vol. 2, No. 1 (Winter, 1990), pp. 16\u201334.</ref>\n\nThere are many variations and subgenres of ''Bildungsroman'' that focus on the growth of an individual.

Many of the first anarchists in Belarus were dissatisfied with the moderate positions and \"generality\" of existing socialist parties like the [[General Jewish Labour Bund|Jewish Labour Bund]], the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP), and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]]. They demanded the destruction of the [[State (polity)|state]], which included not only the [[monarchy]], but also the [[parliamentary republic]]; these were both deemed a tool of [[class oppression]]. For these anarchists, [[democracy]] was not a viable alternative, as the word meant \"''kratiya''\", or power, specifically of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe most decisive tactics used by these anarchists were [[expropriation]] and the incitation of [[individual terror]], which created a halo of the \"defenders of the working class\" around them. Though workers from [[Bia\u0142ystok|Bialystok]] joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale, the anarchists could not move beyond local economic victories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://politring.com/articles/25433-yuriy-glushakov-anarhisty-v-belarusi.html|title=\u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u0413\u043b\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439|date=2019|work=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0433|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n=== The October Revolution ===\nThe leaders of the anarchist movement in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt]] in 1917 were born or participated in the anarchist movement in Belarus - Joseph Blakhman-Solntsev, Konstantin Akashev, Efim Yarchuk, and others. Anarchists, along with the Bolsheviks and the Left Essers, became the leading force of the October Revolution. Soon Lenin's party will even adopt the name \"communist\" from [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkinites]]. But in order to distinguish itself from the anarchist-communists and esser-communists, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] stresses in his name - \"Communist Bolsheviks\".\n\nIf in the central part of Russia this union was soon broken up, in German-occupied Belarus, the united front of all Soviet parties, acting in the underground, was preserved until early 1919. But then repressions - on the one hand, attracting loyal anarchist Communists to the Communist Party - on the other, the Bolsheviks managed to limit the influence of the anarchist movement. But until the early 1920s, legal and semi-legal anarchist circles were still operating in Belarus. Soon, however, the Councils of People's Self-Government, which was the dream of Peter Kropotkin's supporters, were finally turned by the party bureaucracy into its auxiliary bodies.

However, in the 60-70s in Minsk, [[Gomel]] and other cities there were \"hippies,\" which can be referred to anarchist subculture with a certain degree of tension. However, there were no organizations in this case.\n\nIn the spring of 1991, Gomel anarchists took part in a citywide strike, helping the workers of the \"Polespechat\" factory to join it.\n\nIn summer 1992, at the initiative of Oleg Novikov, at a congress in Minsk, activists from Minsk, Gomel and Svetlogorsk joined the Federation of Anarchists of Belarus (FAB).\n\nOn October 6th, 1992, International Unemployment Day, Gomel anarchists held an unsanctioned rally, which ended in clashes with police and arrests. The same year the \"Union of the Unemployed\" was created with the participation of Gomel anarchists and agitation campaigns were organized at the city enterprises. The Anarchy newspaper, the first anarchist edition in Belarus, was published in Gomel in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 in Minsk the anti-party group \"Chyrvony Zhond\" also started its activity, which played a significant role in the development of anarchist movement in Belarus.\n\nSince the beginning of 1998, the Navinki newspaper has been published. At the beginning of 1999, as a result of the hapening campaign \"Legalize It\", the newspaper Navinki was officially registered, which had previously been published illegally. At the same time, Chyrvonyi Zhond, which originally issued Navinki, was banned in Belarus.\n\nOne of the longest and at the same time the most successful actions, conducted with the participation of Belarusian anarchists, can be considered the environmental campaign \"Viasiolka\", launched in 1998. The campaign was directed against the plans of the [[Belarusian nuclear power plant|Belarusian NPP]] construction developed by the government. With the participation of the FAB activists an independent environmental initiative Ecasupraciou was created, which took upon itself the organization of the whole campaign, to which were drawn employees of the Academy of Sciences of Belarus, interested scientists, press, as well as activists of the Russian radical environmental movement Rainbow Keepers, who had experience of such events. The newspaper Viasiolka started to be published. Its pages covered all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and radioecology. During 1998-99 with the help of scientists several seminars were organized on the expediency of NPP construction. In summer 1998, the activists of Ekasupravu organized a \"March for Nuclear Free Belarus\" on the planned sites of the NPP construction in [[Mogilev Region|Mahiliou voblast]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy in By - \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0437\u043c \u0432 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438|last=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043a|first=\u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044e\u043a|publisher=Samizdat|year=2003|isbn=|location=Minsk|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<!--Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

For the anarchists, the word \"[[democracy]]\" was almost curse. After all, it still meant \"kratiya\" - that is, power. And the power of the bourgeoisie, no less hated by rebels than officials.\n\nThere was also a decisive tactic of anarchists - individual terror and expropriation. Thanks to the intimidation of the masters - the so-called \"[[Economic terrorism|economic terror]],\" the [[Anarcho-communism|anarchist-communists]] won most stakes. This created a halo of real \"defenders of the working class\" around them. And the workers of Bialystok joined the anarchist federation on a massive scale.

Officers also undergo paramilitary training similar to the army but with an additional focus on law enforcement.\n\n==About==\n[[File:Rpcacommander-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|RPCA officers of Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n[[File:Royal Thai police headquarter.jpg|thumb|Royal Thai Police headquarters in [[Pathum Wan]] District, [[Bangkok]]]]\nUntil the 19th century [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] personnel, aside from their duties of national defence, also performed law enforcement duties alongside dedicated civil servants. Responsibility for law and order was divided into the six ministries led by chancellors of state (during the Ayutthaya and Thonburi eras); in time of war, police units were under royal command as part of the army. Only during the reigns of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) and King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) did the nation see a huge reform and the Westernization of Thai law enforcement forces to adapt to the changing situation and needs of the country. By 1902, the [[Royal Police Cadet Academy]] (RCPA)<ref>{{cite web |title=RCPA: Royal Police Cadet Academy |url=http://www.rpca.ac.th/ |website=RCPA |accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> was founded to train future police officers. In 1915 the provincial and urban police forces were united as one national organization under the Ministry of Interior (established 1894).<ref name=Haanstad-2013>{{cite book|last1=Haanstad|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Chambers|editor1-first=Paul|title=Knights of the Realm: Thailand's Military and Police, Then and Now|date=2013|publisher=White Lotus Press|isbn=9744801980|page=461|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303374463_A_Brief_History_of_the_Thai_Police|accessdate=15 February 2017|format=PDF|chapter=Chapter 3: A Brief History of the Thai Police}}</ref>\n\nPrimary responsibility for the maintenance of public order through enforcement of the kingdom's laws was exercised by the Thailand National Police Department (TNPD), a subdivision of the Interior Ministry. Charged with performing police functions throughout the entire country, the TNPD was a unitary agency whose power and influence in Thai national life had at times rivalled that of the armed forces itself.\n\nThe formal functions of the TNPD included more than the enforcement of laws and apprehension of offenders. The department also played an important role in the government's efforts to suppress the remnants of the [[communist insurgency in Thailand|communist insurgency]]. In the event of an invasion by external forces, much of the police force would come under the control of the Ministry of Defense to serve with, but not be incorporated into, the military forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOriginally modelled on the pre\u2013World War II national police force of [[Japan]], the TNPD was reorganized several times to meet changing public order and internal security needs. American advice, training, and equipment, which were provided from 1951 through the early 1970s, did much to introduce new law enforcement concepts and practices and to aid in the modernization of the TNPD. During this era the strength and effectiveness of the police grew steadily.\n\nAll components of the police system were administered by the TNPD headquarters in Bangkok, which also provided technical support for law enforcement activities throughout the kingdom. The major operational units of the force were the Provincial Police, the Border Patrol Police (BPP), the Metropolitan Police, and smaller specialized units supervised by the Central Investigation Bureau.\n\nIn mid-1987 the total strength of the TNPD, including administrative and support personnel, was estimated at roughly 110,000. Of this number, over one-half were assigned to the Provincial Police and some 40,000 to the BPP. More than 10,000 served in the Metropolitan Police. Quasi-military in character, the TNPD was headed by a director general, who held the rank of police general. He was assisted by three deputy directors general and five assistant directors general, all of whom held the rank of police lieutenant general. Throughout the TNPD system, all ranks except the lowest (constable) corresponded to those of the army. The proliferation of high ranks in the TNPD organizational structure, as in the military, indicated the political impact of the police on national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1998, TNPD was transferred from the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] of Thailand to be directly under the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. It acquired a new name, in English, the \"Royal Thai Police\" (RTP).

It is headed by a commander who reported to the police commissioner-general, and administered through four police regions\u2014geographic areas of responsibility similar to those of the army regional commands. This force provides police services to every town and village throughout the kingdom except metropolitan Bangkok and border areas. The Provincial Police thus handled law enforcement activities and in many cases was the principal representative of the central government's authority in much of the country.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early-1970s, as the police assumed an increasing role in counterinsurgency operations, a lack of coordination among security forces operating in the rural areas became apparent. Observers noted that the overall police effort suffered because of conflicting organizational patterns and the highly centralized control system that required decisions on most matters to emanate from the various police bureaus of the (then) TNPD headquarters in Bangkok.\n\nA reorganization of the TNPD in 1978 and 1979 gave more command authority to the four police [[lieutenant general]]s who served as regional commissioners of the Provincial Police. Thereafter, the senior officers of each region not only controlled all provincial police assigned to their respective geographic areas but also directed the railroad, highway, marine, and forestry police units operating there, without going through the chain of command to the Central Investigation Bureau in Bangkok.

Among the police, uniforms tend to resemble army dress rather than conventional police uniforms.\n\nConsidered part of the police \"uniform\", all male officers are required to shave the sides and back of their heads, leaving a short crop of hair on the top, hence its common name, ({{lang-th|\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e14\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''khao sam dan''}}), or 'three white sides'. The models for the haircut are the royal guards who protect King [[Vajiralongkorn]].

At the level of constable, this petty thievery is driven by low wages: entry level salaries for police with no university education was 6,800 baht (2012).

The \"cash-for-jobs\" culture within the police is too deep to uproot, he says, alleging that low-ranking officers earning just US$460 a month tap the public for bribes, or solicit protection money from dodgy businesses to top up their salaries and buy promotions. \"Rank and status is everything in Thailand... when you are a small policeman to go up [sic], you need to have the right boss, and preferably one at a 'golden police station'\u2013 near a casino or entertainment venue\", he explained.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thailand's top cop: graft-buster or junta hatchet man?|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/asia/thailands-top-cop-graft-buster-or-junta-hatchet-man|accessdate=19 Apr 2015|work=AsiaOne|agency=Agence France Presse|date=2015-04-19}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2008 article, ''The Economist'' summed up their assessment succinctly: \"In Thailand's most sensational crimes, the prime suspects are often the police.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=The Thai police; A law unto themselves|url=http://www.economist.com/node/11058580|accessdate=26 August 2015|work=The Economist|date=2008-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, a post was made on the [[Sakon Nakhon]] Police Facebook page, allegedly from a junior officer.

The RTP employs between 210,700 and 230,000 officers, roughly 17 percent of all civil servants (excluding the military and the employees of state-owned enterprises).<ref name=\"BP-20160224\" /><ref name=Interpol>{{cite web|title=Thailand Royal Thai Police|url=http://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Asia-South-Pacific/Thailand|website=Interpol|accessdate=3 Apr 2015}}</ref> The RTP is frequently recognized as the fourth armed force of Thailand since their tradition, concept, culture, skill, and training are relatively similar to the army and most of their officer cadets need to graduate from the [[Armed Forces Academies Preparatory School]] before entering the Police Academy. Officers also undergo paramilitary training similar to the army but with an additional focus on law enforcement.\n\n==About==\n[[File:Rpcacommander-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|RPCA officers of Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n[[File:Royal Thai police headquarter.jpg|thumb|Royal Thai Police headquarters in [[Pathum Wan]] District, [[Bangkok]]]]\nUntil the 19th century [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]] personnel, aside from their duties of national defence, also performed law enforcement duties alongside dedicated civil servants. Responsibility for law and order was divided into the six ministries led by chancellors of state (during the Ayutthaya and Thonburi eras); in time of war, police units were under royal command as part of the army. Only during the reigns of King [[Mongkut]] (Rama IV) and King [[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) did the nation see a huge reform and the Westernization of Thai law enforcement forces to adapt to the changing situation and needs of the country. By 1902, the [[Royal Police Cadet Academy]] (RCPA)<ref>{{cite web |title=RCPA: Royal Police Cadet Academy |url=http://www.rpca.ac.th/ |website=RCPA |accessdate=4 August 2019}}</ref> was founded to train future police officers. In 1915 the provincial and urban police forces were united as one national organization under the Ministry of Interior (established 1894).<ref name=Haanstad-2013>{{cite book|last1=Haanstad|first1=Eric|editor1-last=Chambers|editor1-first=Paul|title=Knights of the Realm: Thailand's Military and Police, Then and Now|date=2013|publisher=White Lotus Press|isbn=9744801980|page=461|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303374463_A_Brief_History_of_the_Thai_Police|accessdate=15 February 2017|format=PDF|chapter=Chapter 3: A Brief History of the Thai Police}}</ref>\n\nPrimary responsibility for the maintenance of public order through enforcement of the kingdom's laws was exercised by the Thailand National Police Department (TNPD), a subdivision of the Interior Ministry. Charged with performing police functions throughout the entire country, the TNPD was a unitary agency whose power and influence in Thai national life had at times rivalled that of the armed forces itself.\n\nThe formal functions of the TNPD included more than the enforcement of laws and apprehension of offenders. The department also played an important role in the government's efforts to suppress the remnants of the [[communist insurgency in Thailand|communist insurgency]]. In the event of an invasion by external forces, much of the police force would come under the control of the Ministry of Defense to serve with, but not be incorporated into, the military forces.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nOriginally modelled on the pre\u2013World War II national police force of [[Japan]], the TNPD was reorganized several times to meet changing public order and internal security needs. American advice, training, and equipment, which were provided from 1951 through the early 1970s, did much to introduce new law enforcement concepts and practices and to aid in the modernization of the TNPD. During this era the strength and effectiveness of the police grew steadily.\n\nAll components of the police system were administered by the TNPD headquarters in Bangkok, which also provided technical support for law enforcement activities throughout the kingdom. The major operational units of the force were the Provincial Police, the Border Patrol Police (BPP), the Metropolitan Police, and smaller specialized units supervised by the Central Investigation Bureau.\n\nIn mid-1987 the total strength of the TNPD, including administrative and support personnel, was estimated at roughly 110,000. Of this number, over one-half were assigned to the Provincial Police and some 40,000 to the BPP. More than 10,000 served in the Metropolitan Police. Quasi-military in character, the TNPD was headed by a director general, who held the rank of police general. He was assisted by three deputy directors general and five assistant directors general, all of whom held the rank of police lieutenant general. Throughout the TNPD system, all ranks except the lowest (constable) corresponded to those of the army. The proliferation of high ranks in the TNPD organizational structure, as in the military, indicated the political impact of the police on national life.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1998, TNPD was transferred from the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]] of Thailand to be directly under the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Thailand)|Office of the Prime Minister]]. It acquired a new name, in English, the \"Royal Thai Police\" (RTP). The title of its commander was changed from \"Director-General of the TNPD\" to \"Commissioner-General of the Royal Thai Police\".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Personnel==\nThailand's police forces number about 230,000 officers.

It is headed by a commander who reported to the police commissioner-general, and administered through four police regions\u2014geographic areas of responsibility similar to those of the army regional commands. This force provides police services to every town and village throughout the kingdom except metropolitan Bangkok and border areas. The Provincial Police thus handled law enforcement activities and in many cases was the principal representative of the central government's authority in much of the country.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early-1970s, as the police assumed an increasing role in counterinsurgency operations, a lack of coordination among security forces operating in the rural areas became apparent. Observers noted that the overall police effort suffered because of conflicting organizational patterns and the highly centralized control system that required decisions on most matters to emanate from the various police bureaus of the (then) TNPD headquarters in Bangkok.\n\nA reorganization of the TNPD in 1978 and 1979 gave more command authority to the four police [[lieutenant general]]s who served as regional commissioners of the Provincial Police. Thereafter, the senior officers of each region not only controlled all provincial police assigned to their respective geographic areas but also directed the railroad, highway, marine, and forestry police units operating there, without going through the chain of command to the Central Investigation Bureau in Bangkok. Although this change increased the workload of the regional headquarters, it resulted in greater efficiency and improved law enforcement.\n\nThe Provincial Police Division is divided into 10 regions covering the 76 [[Provinces of Thailand]] except metropolitan Bangkok and the border areas:\n* Region 1 - Ayuthaya\n* Region 2 - Chonburi\n* Region 3 - Nakhon Ratchasima\n* Region 4 - Khon Kaen\n* Region 5 - Chiang Mai\n* Region 6 - Phitsanulok\n* Region 7 - Nakhon Pathom\n* Region 8 - Surat Thani\n* Region 9 - Songkhla\n\n;* Chaiya Training\n;* Special Operations Units\n\n===Police education bureau===\n[[File:Rpcacommander-04.jpg|thumb|right|RTP officers, Royal Police Cadet Academy]]\n\nThe RTP Police Education Bureau is responsible for training police personnel in the latest methods of law enforcement and the use of modern weapons.

The bureau also supervises a number of sites established and staffed by the BPP to train its field platoons in counterinsurgency operations.

Bank accounts can be frozen, and documents and property can be seized. Travel can be banned.

The decree basically deputises soldiers as police, but gives greater legal impunity to soldiers than to police.<ref name=\"NM-20200302\" /> The order came into immediate effect and is still in force as of 2020.
