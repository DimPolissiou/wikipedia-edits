During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, with the name ''Cusum'', and was included in the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]].\n\nIn the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by [[Huns|Hunnic invasions]].

It became a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 11th and 12th centuries.

For example, Bivalo (Bivaljo\u0161) was a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th\u20136th centuries.<ref name=\"Curcin\" /> Other names are of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] origin (for example B\u00e9lak\u00fat, K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton, V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad, R\u00e9v), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the [[Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Borovszky\" /> Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.\n\nTax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Bo\u017eo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th\u201317th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted during the Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBetween 1526 and 1687, the region was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the year 1590, the population of all villages that existed in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered at 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those inhabitants who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]]) was likely larger than was recorded.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0110or\u0111e Randelj|title=Novi Sad slobodan grad|location=Novi Sad|year=1997|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n=== Founding of Novi Sad ===\n[[File:Bredael Schlacht bei Peterwardein.jpg|thumb|left|1716 [[Battle of Petrovaradin]].]]\nHabsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] from residing in [[Petrovaradin]]. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ({{lang-de|[[Rascians|Ratzen]] Stadt}}). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski \u0160anac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of [[Alma\u0161]] were resettled to Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, where they founded [[Alma\u0161ki Kraj]] ('the Alma\u0161 quarter').\n[[File:Razglednica Novog Sada 2.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of Novi Sad with a picture of Lajos Kossuth Street (early 20th century).]]\n\nAccording to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names ''Novi Sad'' and ''\u00dajvid\u00e9k'' (''Neoplanta'' in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city'.\n\nThe edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:\n{{quote|' We, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], by the grace of God [[Holy Roman Empress]],<br />Queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Prozor-Rama|Rama]], [[Serbia]], [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Lodomeria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [...]<br />cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the [[Ba\u010dka]] province on the [[Sajlovo]] land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a [[Free imperial city|Free Royal City]] and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, renaming it Neoplantae ([[Latin]]), \u00daj-Vid\u00e9gh ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), Neusatz ([[German language|German]]) and Novi Sad ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) '|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.\n\n=== Habsburg Monarchy ===\n[[File:Patrijarh Rajacic blagosilja vojsku.JPG|thumb|left|[[Serb uprising of 1848\u201349]], Serbian patriarch [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] is giving a blessing to the army of Serbian Vojvodina in [[1848]] .]]\n\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also [[Serbian Revival]]), who did not have their own [[Nation state|national state]] at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian [[Athens]]' (''Srpska Atina'' in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], 5,724 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 1,032 [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 727 [[Jews]], and 30 adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]]. The largest [[ethnic group]] in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were [[Germans]].\n[[File:Razglednica_Novog_Sada_1.jpg|thumb|right|Novi Sad on the postcard from 1900.]]\n\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848\u201349]], Novi Sad was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog]] County. The post office was opened in 1853.\n\nFollowing the [[compromise of 1867]], Novi Sad was located within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''[[Transleithania]]'', which comprised half of the new [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. During this time, the [[Magyarization]] policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the [[Serbian language]] most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ([[Bunjevci]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Jews]], other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 320</ref>\n\nSimilar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 317</ref> In 1910, the population included 13,383 [[Roman Catholics]] and 11,553 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], while 3,089 declared themselves as [[Lutheran]], 2,751 as [[Calvinist]], and 2,326 as [[Jewish]].<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai18_3.pdf \u00dajvid\u00e9k].

The main part of the city lies on the left bank of the Danube in the region of [[Ba\u010dka]], while the smaller settlements of [[Petrovaradin]] and [[Sremska Kamenica]] lie on the right bank, in the region of [[Srem]] (Syrmia). The section situated on the left bank of the river lies on one of the southernmost and lowest parts of the [[Pannonian Plain]], while [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] on the right bank is a [[Horst (geology)|horst]] mountain. [[Alluvial plain]]s along the Danube are well-formed, especially on the left bank, and in some parts {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the river. A large part of Novi Sad lies on a [[fluvial terrace]] with an [[elevation]] between {{convert|80|to|83|m|0|abbr=off}}. The northern part of Fru\u0161ka Gora is composed of massive [[landslide]] zones, although they are largely inactive with the exception of the [[Ribnjak, Novi Sad|Ribnjak]] neighbourhood between [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin Fortress]].<ref name=\"UrbNS\">\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043c: \"\u0415\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0410\u0442\u043b\u0430\u0441 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0430\u0434\u0430\" (\"Ecological Atlas of Novi Sad\"), page 14-15, 1994.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\nThe total land area of the city is {{convert|699|km\u00b2|0|abbr=out}}, while its urban area spans {{convert|129.7|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GeoNS\">{{cite web | url = http://www.novisad.rs/en/content/novi-sad-in-numbers | title = Novi Sad in numbers | publisher = City of Novi Sad | accessdate = 2010-10-12 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101007011404/http://novisad.rs/en/content/novi-sad-in-numbers | archivedate = 2010-10-07 }}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nNovi Sad has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'')<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{cite web|title=Temperature, Climograph, Climate table for Novi Sad|url=//en.climate-data.org/location/1020/|website=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=4 November 2017}}</ref> closely bordering a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Dfb'') with a January mean of {{convert|0.2|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

The city was almost completely destroyed during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848/1849 revolution]], so architecture from the 19th century dominates the [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]]. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.\n\nDuring the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many [[plattenbau|communist-style]] [[high-rise]] buildings were erected. The total number of [[apartment building]]s, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962\u201364, a new [[boulevard]], today called ''Bulevar oslobo\u0111enja'', was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, [[traffic congestion]] is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Novi Sad}}\n[[File:Novi Sad main street.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|King Alexander street]]\n[[File:Novi Sad City Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Novi Sad center at the night]]\n\nSome of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]], [[Podbara]], and [[Salajka]]. The areas of [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin]], located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], as well as [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ([[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]] was divided into four sections, numbered I\u2013IV).\n\nNew neighbourhoods, like [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], [[Detelinara]] and [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]] and [[Bulevar]] neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like [[Grbavica (Novi Sad)|Grbavica]] have completely been transformed.\n\nNeighbourhoods with single family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. [[Telep]], situated in the southwest, and [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], in the north, are the oldest such districts. [[Adice]] and [[Veternik]], both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to an influx of Serb refugees fleeing the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nWhile Novi Sad's urban municipalities, which include [[Petrovaradin]], [[Sremska Kamenica]] and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town.<ref name=Census /> The largest numbers live in [[Futog]] (pop. 20,000) and in [[Veternik]] (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.\n\nSuburbs like Futog are officially classified as an '<nowiki/>''urban settlement'<nowiki/>'' (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be '<nowiki/>''rural''' (village).  [[Ledinci]], [[Stari Ledinci]] and [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] are all villages located on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]\u2019s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. [[Stari Ledinci]] is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad\u2019s suburban areas.\n\nTowns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Temerin]] and [[Beo\u010din]] share the same [[public transport]]ation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Status\n!City municipality\n!Population<ref name=Census />\n|-\n| 1 || [[Bege\u010d]] || rowspan=4|Village || rowspan=2|[[City municipality of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,325\n|-\n| 2 || [[Budisava]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|3,656\n|-\n| 3 || [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] || [[Petrovaradin]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,936\n|-\n| 4 || [[\u010cenej]] || rowspan=5|Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,125\n|-\n| 5 || [[Futog]] || rowspan=2|Town || style=\"text-align:right;\"|18,641\n|-\n| 6 || [[Ka\u0107]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11,740\n|-\n| 7 || [[Kisa\u010d]] || rowspan=6|Village || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,091\n|-\n| 8 || [[Kovilj]]  || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,414\n|-\n| 9 || [[Ledinci]] ||  Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,912\n|-\n| 10 || [[Rumenka]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,495\n|-\n| 11 || [[Stari Ledinci]] || Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 934\n|-\n| 12 || [[Stepanovi\u0107evo]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"|2,021\n|-\n| 13 || [[Veternik]] || Town || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17,454\n|}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographic history of Novi Sad}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1798|6890 |1848|18530 |1900|28763 |1910|33089 |1921|39122 |1931|63985 |1941|61731 |1948|69431 |1953|76752 |1961|102469 |1971|141375 |1981|170020 |1991|198326 |2002|216583 |2011|277522\n|\n}}\n\nNovi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia (after [[Belgrade]]), and the largest city in [[Vojvodina]]. Since its founding, the population of the city has been constantly increasing. According to the 1991 census, 56.2% of the people who came to Novi Sad from 1961 to 1991 were from Vojvodina, while 15.3% came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and 11.7% from rest of Serbia.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the city experienced significant population growth. According to the 2011 census,<ref name=\"media.popis2011.stat.rs\" /> the city's population is 250,439, while in its urban area (including adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) there are 277,522 inhabitants.

During that time, almost every Serbian novelist, poet, jurist, and publisher had lived or worked in Novi Sad at some point in their career. Some of these cultural workers included [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], [[Mika Anti\u0107]], [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 Zmaj]] , among others. [[Matica srpska]], the oldest cultural-scientific institution in Serbia, was moved from [[Budapest]] to Novi Sad in 1864, and now contains the second-largest library in the country, the Library of Matica srpska, with over 3.5 million volumes.

Celts were present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century, with the name ''Cusum'', and was included in the [[Roman province]] of [[Pannonia]].\n\nIn the 5th century, Cusum was devastated by [[Huns|Hunnic invasions]]. By the end of the same century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] had reconstructed the town and called it by the names ''Petrikon'' or ''Petrikov'' ({{lang-gr|\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd}}) after [[Saint Peter]]. [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes such as the [[Severians]], the [[Obotrites]] and the [[Serbs]] (including the subtribes of the [[Brani\u010devci]] and the [[Timo\u010dani]]) settled today's region around Novi Sad mainly in the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref name=\"Sava S 1998, page 36\">Sava S.

It became a part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between the 11th and 12th centuries. Hungarians began to settle in the area, which before that time was mostly populated by Slavs, and the place was first mentioned under the Hungarian variant ''Peturwarad'' or ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin''/\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043d), which derived from the Byzantine variant, found in documents from 1237. That same year, several other settlements were mentioned as existing in the territory of modern-day urban Novi Sad.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFrom the 13th century to the 16th century, the following settlements existed within the territory of the urban areas of modern-day Novi Sad:<ref name=Curcin>Branko \u0106ur\u010din, [[Slana Bara]] nekad i sad, Novi Sad, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"Borovszky\">Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I.-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n*on the right bank of the Danube: ''P\u00e9terv\u00e1rad'' (Serbian: ''Petrovaradin'') and ''Kamanc'' (Serbian: ''Kamenica'').\n*on the left bank of the Danube: ''Baksa'' or ''Baksafalva'' ({{lang-sr|Bak\u0161a, Bak\u0161i\u0107}}), ''K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton'' ({{lang-sr|Sent Marton}}), ''Bivalyos'' or ''Bivalo'' ({{lang-sr|Bivaljo\u0161, Bivalo}}), ''V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad'' or ''V\u00e1rad'' ({{lang-sr|Va\u0161aro\u0161 Varad, Varadinci}}), ''Zajol I'' (Serbian: ''[[Gornje Livade, Novi Sad|Sajlovo I]]'', ''Gornje Sajlovo'', ''Gornje Isailovo''), ''Zajol II'' (Serbian: ''[[Sajlovo]] II'', ''Donje Sajlovo'', ''Donje Isailovo''), ''Bistritz'' (Serbian: ''[[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Bistrica]]''). Some other settlements existed in the [[suburb]]s of Novi Sad: ''Mort\u00e1lyos'' (Serbian: ''Mrtvaljo\u0161''), ''Csenei'' ({{lang-sr|[[\u010cenej]]}}), ''Kem\u00e9nd'' (Serbian: ''[[Kamendin, Sirig|Kamendin]]''), ''R\u00e9v'' ({{lang-sr|Rivica}}).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAn etymology of settlement names reveals that some designations are of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin, which indicates that the areas were initially inhabited by Slavs, particularly the [[West Slavs]]. For example, Bivalo (Bivaljo\u0161) was a large Slavic settlement dating from the 5th\u20136th centuries.<ref name=\"Curcin\" /> Other names are of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] origin (for example B\u00e9lak\u00fat, K\u0171szentm\u00e1rton, V\u00e1s\u00e1rosv\u00e1rad, R\u00e9v), indicating that the settlements were inhabited by Hungarians before the [[Ottoman invasion]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Borovszky\" /> Some settlement names are of uncertain origin.\n\nTax records from 1522 show a mix of Hungarian and Slavic names among the inhabitants of these villages, including Slavic names like Bozso (Bo\u017eo), Radovan, Radonya (Radonja), Ivo, etc. Following the Ottoman invasion in the 16th\u201317th centuries, some of these settlements were destroyed. Most of the surviving Hungarian inhabitants retreated from the area. Some of the settlements persisted during the Ottoman rule and were populated by ethnic Serbs.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBetween 1526 and 1687, the region was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the year 1590, the population of all villages that existed in the territory of present-day Novi Sad numbered at 105 houses, inhabited exclusively by Serbs. Ottoman records mention only those inhabitants who paid taxes, so the number of Serbs who lived in the area (for example, those that served in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]]) was likely larger than was recorded.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0110or\u0111e Randelj|title=Novi Sad slobodan grad|location=Novi Sad|year=1997|language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n=== Founding of Novi Sad ===\n[[File:Bredael Schlacht bei Peterwardein.jpg|thumb|left|1716 [[Battle of Petrovaradin]].]]\nHabsburg rule was aligned with the Roman Catholic doctrine and, as it took over this area near the end of the 17th century, the government prohibited people of [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] from residing in [[Petrovaradin]]. Unable to build homes there, the Serbs of the area founded a new settlement in 1694 on the left bank of the Danube. They initially called it the 'Serb city' ({{lang-de|[[Rascians|Ratzen]] Stadt}}). Another name used for the settlement was Petrovaradinski \u0160anac. In 1718, the inhabitants of the village of [[Alma\u0161]] were resettled to Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, where they founded [[Alma\u0161ki Kraj]] ('the Alma\u0161 quarter').\n[[File:Razglednica Novog Sada 2.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard of Novi Sad with a picture of Lajos Kossuth Street (early 20th century).]]\n\nAccording to 1720 data, the population of Ratzen Stadt was composed of 112 Serbian, 14 German, and 5 Hungarian houses. The settlement officially gained the present names ''Novi Sad'' and ''\u00dajvid\u00e9k'' (''Neoplanta'' in Latin) in 1748 when it became a 'free royal city'.\n\nThe edict that made Novi Sad a 'free royal city' was proclaimed on 1 February 1748. The edict reads:\n{{quote|' We, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], by the grace of God [[Holy Roman Empress]],<br />Queen of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Prozor-Rama|Rama]], [[Serbia]], [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Lodomeria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [...]<br />cast this proclamation to anyone, whom it might concern... so that the renowned Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, which lies on the other side of the Danube in the [[Ba\u010dka]] province on the [[Sajlovo]] land, by the might of our divine royal power and prestige...make this town a [[Free imperial city|Free Royal City]] and to fortify, accept and acknowledge it as one of the free royal cities of our [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and other territories, by abolishing its previous name of Petrovaradinski \u0160anac, renaming it Neoplantae ([[Latin]]), \u00daj-Vid\u00e9gh ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), Neusatz ([[German language|German]]) and Novi Sad ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]) '|sign=|source=}}\n\nIn the 18th century, the Habsburg monarchy recruited Germans from the southern principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to relocate to the Danube valley. They wanted both to increase the population and to redevelop the river valley for agriculture, which had declined markedly under the Ottomans. To encourage such settlement, the government ensured that the German communities could practice their religion (mostly Catholicism) and use their original German dialect.\n\n=== Habsburg Monarchy ===\n[[File:Patrijarh Rajacic blagosilja vojsku.JPG|thumb|left|[[Serb uprising of 1848\u201349]], Serbian patriarch [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] is giving a blessing to the army of Serbian Vojvodina in [[1848]] .]]\n\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Novi Sad remained the largest city inhabited by Serbs. The reformer of the Serbian language, [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]], wrote in 1817 that Novi Sad was the 'largest Serb municipality in the world'. It was a cultural and political centre for Serbs (see also [[Serbian Revival]]), who did not have their own [[Nation state|national state]] at the time. Due to its cultural and political influence, the city became known as the 'Serbian [[Athens]]' (''Srpska Atina'' in Serbian). According to 1843 data, Novi Sad had 17,332 inhabitants, of whom 9,675 were [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], 5,724 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], 1,032 [[Protestantism|Protestants]], 727 [[Jews]], and 30 adherents of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]]. The largest [[ethnic group]] in the city were Serbs, and the second largest were [[Germans]].\n[[File:Razglednica_Novog_Sada_1.jpg|thumb|right|Novi Sad on the postcard from 1900.]]\n\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848\u201349]], Novi Sad was part of [[Serbian Vojvodina]], a Serbian [[Autonomous area|autonomous region]] within the Austrian Empire. In 1849, the Hungarian garrison, located at the Petrovaradin Fortress, bombarded and devastated the city, which lost much of its population. According to the 1850 census, there were only 7,182 citizens left in the city, compared to 17,332 in 1843. Between 1849 and 1860, Novi Sad was part of a separate Austrian crownland known as the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. After the abolishment of this province, the city was included into the [[B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County|Batsch-Bodrog]] County. The post office was opened in 1853.\n\nFollowing the [[compromise of 1867]], Novi Sad was located within the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''[[Transleithania]]'', which comprised half of the new [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. During this time, the [[Magyarization]] policy of the Hungarian government drastically altered the demographic structure of the city as the formerly predominantly Serbian population became one with a more mixed character. In 1880, 41.2% of the city's inhabitants used the [[Serbian language]] most frequently and 25.9% employed Hungarian. In the following decades, the percentage of Serbian-speakers decreased, while the number of Hungarian-speakers increased. According to the 1910 census, the city had 33,590 residents, of whom 13,343 (39.72%) spoke Hungarian, 11,594 (34.52%) Serbian, 5,918 (17.62%) German and 1,453 (4.33%) Slovak. It is not certain whether Hungarians or Serbs were the larger ethnic group in the city in 1910, since the various ethnic groups ([[Bunjevci]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Jews]], other [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people, etc.) were classified in census results only according to the language they spoke.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 320</ref>\n\nSimilar demographic changes can be seen in the religious structure: in 1870, the population of Novi Sad included 8,134 Orthodox Christians, 6,684 Catholics, 1,725 Calvinists, 1,343 Lutherans, and others.<ref>Triva Militar, Novi Sad na raskrsnici minulog i sadanjeg veka, Novi Sad, 2000, p. 317</ref> In 1910, the population included 13,383 [[Roman Catholics]] and 11,553 [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], while 3,089 declared themselves as [[Lutheran]], 2,751 as [[Calvinist]], and 2,326 as [[Jewish]].<ref>[http://mek.niif.hu/06700/06758/pdf/revai18_3.pdf \u00dajvid\u00e9k].

From 1 December 1918, Novi Sad was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]; and in 1929, it became the capital of the [[Danube Banovina]], a province of the newly-named Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Since 1945, Novi Sad has been the capital of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], a province of the [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Republic of Serbia]]. The city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.\n[[File:\u0416\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0459\u0435\u0432_\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442_\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e_\u0441\u0443_\u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0452\u0430\u043b\u0435_\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0435_\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430_\u0422\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0432\u043a.jpeg|thumb|left|[[NATO bombing of Novi Sad|1999 NATO bombing of Novi Sad]].

Devastated by [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombardment]] during the [[Kosovo War]] of 1999, [[1999 NATO bombing of Novi Sad|Novi Sad was left]] without any of its three Danube bridges ([[\u017de\u017eelj Bridge]], [[Varadin Bridge]] and [[Liberty Bridge, Novi Sad|Liberty Bridge]]), communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while the [[oil refinery]] was bombarded daily, causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage. In 2003, FR Yugoslavia was transformed into the [[Political union|state union]] of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. These two states separated in June 2006 (following the May 2006 [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|Montenegrin independence referendum]]), leaving Novi Sad part of the [[Republic of Serbia]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe city lies on the [[meander]] of the river Danube, which is only 350 meters wide beneath the marking stones of Petrovaradin.<ref name=\"GeoNS\" /> A section of the [[Danube-Tisa-Danube Canal|Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal]] marks the northern edge of the wider city centre. The main part of the city lies on the left bank of the Danube in the region of [[Ba\u010dka]], while the smaller settlements of [[Petrovaradin]] and [[Sremska Kamenica]] lie on the right bank, in the region of [[Srem]] (Syrmia). The section situated on the left bank of the river lies on one of the southernmost and lowest parts of the [[Pannonian Plain]], while [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] on the right bank is a [[Horst (geology)|horst]] mountain. [[Alluvial plain]]s along the Danube are well-formed, especially on the left bank, and in some parts {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the river.

The city was almost completely destroyed during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848/1849 revolution]], so architecture from the 19th century dominates the [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|city centre]]. Small, older houses used to surround the centre of town, but they are now being replaced by modern, multi-story buildings.\n\nDuring the socialist period, new city blocks with wide streets and multi-story buildings were constructed around the city core. However, not many [[plattenbau|communist-style]] [[high-rise]] buildings were erected. The total number of [[apartment building]]s, with ten or more floors, remained at about 50, the rest having mostly three to six floors. From 1962\u201364, a new [[boulevard]], today called ''Bulevar oslobo\u0111enja'', was cut through the older neighbourhoods, establishing major communication lines. Several more boulevards were subsequently built in a similar manner, creating an [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] network which replaced the primarily radial structure of the old town. These interventions paved the way for a relatively unhampered growth of the city, which has almost tripled in population since the 1950s. Despite a huge increase in car ownership, [[traffic congestion]] is still relatively mild, apart from a few major arteries.\n\n=== Neighbourhoods ===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Novi Sad}}\n[[File:Novi Sad main street.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|King Alexander street]]\n[[File:Novi Sad City Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|Novi Sad center at the night]]\n\nSome of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city are [[Stari Grad, Novi Sad|Stari Grad]] (Old Town), [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]], [[Podbara]], and [[Salajka]]. The areas of [[Sremska Kamenica]] and [[Petrovaradin]], located on the right bank of the Danube, were separate towns in the past, but today belong to the urban area of Novi Sad. [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], as well as [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], are neighbourhoods built during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, with contemporary style buildings and wide boulevards ([[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]] was divided into four sections, numbered I\u2013IV).\n\nNew neighbourhoods, like [[Liman, Novi Sad|Liman]], [[Detelinara]] and [[Bistrica (Novo Naselje)|Novo Naselje]], emerged from the fields and forests surrounding the city. Following World War II, tall residential buildings were constructed to house the huge influx of people leaving the country side. Many old houses in the city centre, from the [[Rotkvarija (\u017ditni Trg)|Rotkvarija]] and [[Bulevar]] neighbourhoods, were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s, to be replaced by multi-story buildings.  Since the city has experienced a major construction boom in the last 10 years, some neighbourhoods like [[Grbavica (Novi Sad)|Grbavica]] have completely been transformed.\n\nNeighbourhoods with single family homes are mostly located away from the city centre. [[Telep]], situated in the southwest, and [[Klisa, Serbia|Klisa]], in the north, are the oldest such districts. [[Adice]] and [[Veternik]], both located west of the downtown area, have significantly expanded during the last 15 years, partly due to an influx of Serb refugees fleeing the [[Yugoslav wars]].\n\n=== Suburbs ===\nWhile Novi Sad's urban municipalities, which include [[Petrovaradin]], [[Sremska Kamenica]] and Novi Sad proper, have a combined population of about 277,000, its suburban areas have approximately 65,000 inhabitants. Some 23.7% of the administrative city's total population resides in the suburbs, which consist of 12 settlements and 1 town.<ref name=Census /> The largest numbers live in [[Futog]] (pop. 20,000) and in [[Veternik]] (pop. 17,000) to the west. Both places have grown bigger over the years, especially during the 1990s, and have physically merged with the city.\n\nSuburbs like Futog are officially classified as an '<nowiki/>''urban settlement'<nowiki/>'' (town), while other suburbs are mostly considered to be '<nowiki/>''rural''' (village).  [[Ledinci]], [[Stari Ledinci]] and [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] are all villages located on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]]\u2019s slopes, with the last two having only one paved road. [[Stari Ledinci]] is the most isolated and least populated village belonging to Novi Sad\u2019s suburban areas.\n\nTowns and villages in the adjacent municipalities of [[Sremski Karlovci]], [[Temerin]] and [[Beo\u010din]] share the same [[public transport]]ation system and are economically tied to Novi Sad.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Status\n!City municipality\n!Population<ref name=Census />\n|-\n| 1 || [[Bege\u010d]] || rowspan=4|Village || rowspan=2|[[City municipality of Novi Sad|Novi Sad]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,325\n|-\n| 2 || [[Budisava]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"|3,656\n|-\n| 3 || [[Bukovac, Novi Sad|Bukovac]] || [[Petrovaradin]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 3,936\n|-\n| 4 || [[\u010cenej]] || rowspan=5|Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 2,125\n|-\n| 5 || [[Futog]] || rowspan=2|Town || style=\"text-align:right;\"|18,641\n|-\n| 6 || [[Ka\u0107]] || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 11,740\n|-\n| 7 || [[Kisa\u010d]] || rowspan=6|Village || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,091\n|-\n| 8 || [[Kovilj]]  || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 5,414\n|-\n| 9 || [[Ledinci]] ||  Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,912\n|-\n| 10 || [[Rumenka]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 6,495\n|-\n| 11 || [[Stari Ledinci]] || Petrovaradin || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 934\n|-\n| 12 || [[Stepanovi\u0107evo]] || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"|2,021\n|-\n| 13 || [[Veternik]] || Town || Novi Sad || style=\"text-align:right;\"| 17,454\n|}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographic history of Novi Sad}}\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1798|6890 |1848|18530 |1900|28763 |1910|33089 |1921|39122 |1931|63985 |1941|61731 |1948|69431 |1953|76752 |1961|102469 |1971|141375 |1981|170020 |1991|198326 |2002|216583 |2011|277522\n|\n}}\n\nNovi Sad is the second largest city in Serbia (after [[Belgrade]]), and the largest city in [[Vojvodina]]. Since its founding, the population of the city has been constantly increasing. According to the 1991 census, 56.2% of the people who came to Novi Sad from 1961 to 1991 were from Vojvodina, while 15.3% came from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and 11.7% from rest of Serbia.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, the city experienced significant population growth.

This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.\n\n==Powers and duties==\n[[File:Fanfares of President of the Russian Federation.ogg|thumb|The Presidential Fanfare.]]\n[[File:Address to the Federal Assembly (2012-12-12) - 09.jpeg|upright=1.15|thumb|President Vladimir Putin delivering the 2012 [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|Address to the Federal Assembly]]]]\n\n===Guarantor of the Constitution===\nAs the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the President ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country's Constitution and federal laws.\n\n===Nominations===\nThe President is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The President submits nominations to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of [[Federal Assembly of Russia|the parliament]], for judges of the [[Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of Russia|Supreme Arbitration Court]], as well as for [[Prosecutor General of Russia]]. A proposal to relieve the Prosecutor General of his duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The President submits to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the Chairman of the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank]], and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the Chairman of the Central Bank of his duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |title=Authority and Duties of the President |publisher=Archive.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210072025/http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nUnder the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the President exercises his [[Right of initiative (legislative)|right to submit draft legislation]], as well as the right to [[sign into law|sign bills into law]] or to [[veto]] them.\n\nThe President has the right to suspend laws and [[regulation]]s issued by executive bodies of Russia's constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate [[human rights in Russia|human]] and [[civil rights]] and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.\n\nThe President can [[Decree of the President of Russia|issue by-laws by decree]], so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia's international agreements or the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe President is further empowered to grant federal [[Pardon#Russia|pardons]] and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nOther powers of the President in the sphere of legal activities and in his interaction with the Parliament include calling [[Elections in Russia|elections]] to the State Duma, [[Dissolving parliament#Russia|dissolving the State Duma]] in certain cases, and calling [[referendum]].\n\n===Domestic policy===\nUnder the Constitution, the President is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.\n\n==Powers and duties==\n[[File:Fanfares of President of the Russian Federation.ogg|thumb|The Presidential Fanfare.]]\n[[File:Address to the Federal Assembly (2012-12-12) - 09.jpeg|upright=1.15|thumb|President Vladimir Putin delivering the 2012 [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|Address to the Federal Assembly]]]]\n\n===Guarantor of the Constitution===\nAs the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the President ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country's Constitution and federal laws.\n\n===Nominations===\nThe President is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The President submits nominations to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of [[Federal Assembly of Russia|the parliament]], for judges of the [[Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of Russia|Supreme Arbitration Court]], as well as for [[Prosecutor General of Russia]]. A proposal to relieve the Prosecutor General of his duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The President submits to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the Chairman of the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank]], and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the Chairman of the Central Bank of his duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |title=Authority and Duties of the President |publisher=Archive.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210072025/http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nUnder the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the President exercises his [[Right of initiative (legislative)|right to submit draft legislation]], as well as the right to [[sign into law|sign bills into law]] or to [[veto]] them.\n\nThe President has the right to suspend laws and [[regulation]]s issued by executive bodies of Russia's constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate [[human rights in Russia|human]] and [[civil rights]] and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.\n\nThe President can [[Decree of the President of Russia|issue by-laws by decree]], so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia's international agreements or the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe President is further empowered to grant federal [[Pardon#Russia|pardons]] and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nOther powers of the President in the sphere of legal activities and in his interaction with the Parliament include calling [[Elections in Russia|elections]] to the State Duma, [[Dissolving parliament#Russia|dissolving the State Duma]] in certain cases, and calling [[referendum]].\n\n===Domestic policy===\nUnder the Constitution, the President is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

Within the thymus, [[T cell]]s mature. T cells are critical to the [[adaptive immune system]], where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located in the anterior [[Mediastinum#Superior mediastinum|superior mediastinum]], in front of the [[heart]] and behind the [[sternum]]. Each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central [[Thymus#Medulla|medulla]] and a peripheral [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] which is surrounded by an outer capsule.\n\nThe cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T cells. [[Cell (biology)|Cells]] in the thymus can be divided into thymic [[stromal cell]]s and cells of [[hematopoietic]] origin (derived from bone marrow resident [[hematopoietic stem cells]]).  Developing T cells are referred to as [[thymocyte]]s and are of hematopoietic origin.  Stromal cells include [[epithelial cells]] of the thymic cortex and medulla, and [[dendritic cell]]s. The thymus provides an environment for development of T cells from precursor cells. The cells of the thymus provide for development of T cells that are functional and self-tolerant. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of [[central tolerance]].\n\nThe thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods.  By the early teens, the [[Thymic involution|thymus begins to decrease in size and activity]] and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by [[adipose tissue]] (fat).  Nevertheless, residual T [[lymphopoiesis]] continues throughout adult life.\n\n== Structure ==\nIn children, the thymus is pinkish-gray, soft, and lobulated on its surfaces.<ref name=\"Grays2008\" /> At birth it is about 4\u20136&nbsp;cm long, 2.5\u20135&nbsp;cm wide, and about 1&nbsp;cm thick.<ref name=\"Grays2016\" /> It increases in size until puberty, where it may have a size of about 40\u201350&nbsp;g,<ref name=\"Robbins9th\" /><ref name=\"Wheaters2013\" /> following which it decreases in size in a process known as [[Involution (medicine)|involution]].<ref name=\"Wheaters2013\" />\n\nThe thymus is made up of two lobes that meet in the upper midline, and stretch from below the [[thyroid]] in the neck to as low as the cartilage of the fourth rib.<ref name=Grays2008>{{cite book| editor-first1 = Susan | editor-last1 = Standring | editor-first2 = Neil R. | editor-last2 = Borley | name-list-format = vanc |title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice |date=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=London|isbn=978-0-8089-2371-8|edition=40th|display-editors=1}}</ref> The lobes are covered by a capsule.<ref name=\"Robbins9th\" /> The thymus lies beneath the [[Human sternum|sternum]], rests on the [[pericardium]], and is separated from the [[aortic arch]] and [[great vessels]] by a layer of [[fascia]].

Within the thymus, [[T cell]]s mature. T cells are critical to the [[adaptive immune system]], where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located in the anterior [[Mediastinum#Superior mediastinum|superior mediastinum]], in front of the [[heart]] and behind the [[sternum]]. Each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central [[Thymus#Medulla|medulla]] and a peripheral [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortex]] which is surrounded by an outer capsule.\n\nThe cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T cells. [[Cell (biology)|Cells]] in the thymus can be divided into thymic [[stromal cell]]s and cells of [[hematopoietic]] origin (derived from bone marrow resident [[hematopoietic stem cells]]).  Developing T cells are referred to as [[thymocyte]]s and are of hematopoietic origin.  Stromal cells include [[epithelial cells]] of the thymic cortex and medulla, and [[dendritic cell]]s. The thymus provides an environment for development of T cells from precursor cells. The cells of the thymus provide for development of T cells that are functional and self-tolerant. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of [[central tolerance]].\n\nThe thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods.  By the early teens, the [[Thymic involution|thymus begins to decrease in size and activity]] and the tissue of the thymus is gradually replaced by [[adipose tissue]] (fat).

It is currently in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] on [[Nick at Nite]], and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\n== Series synopsis ==\n[[File:GeorgeLopezsitcomcast.jpg|thumb|left|The season 4 cast of ''George Lopez'' (from left to right): Valente Rodriguez as Ernie Cardenas, Constance Marie with Luis Armand Garcia as Angie and Max Lopez, Emiliano D\u00edez as Vic Palmero, Belita Moreno as Benny Lopez, George Lopez as George Lopez, and Masiela Lusha as Carmen Lopez.]]\n\nThe comedy revolves around a fictionalized portrayal of Lopez who works at the Powers Brothers aviation factory, and raises daughter Carmen and son Max with wife Angie after surviving a miserable, dysfunctional childhood at the hands of his neglectful [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother Benny, who is portrayed as selfish and cold-hearted. Other characters include Angie's indulgent father, [[wealth]]y [[physician|doctor]] Vic Palmero; and George's best [[childhood]] [[friendship|friend]] Ernie Cardenas, noted for his socially-awkward behavior and unsuccessful attempts at dating. After Carmen's departure from the series, Angie's overindulged niece Veronica moved in, laden with a large trust fund that is entrusted to George's care.\n\nMultiple storylines in the series are established through the unveiling of a secret guarded by Benny throughout George's whole childhood, most notably the discovery that his father Manny is still alive after Benny had convinced George that he died. Throughout much of the series George tries to locate his father; when Manny is finally introduced, he turns out to be a nasty but successful [[Businessperson|businessman]] who is now married to a woman named Lydia with whom he has more children.

During the show's fifth season, [[Aimee Garcia]] was cast as George's niece, Veronica.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe show's theme song is \"[[Low Rider]]\", performed by [[War (U.S. band)|War]]. The theme plays in the opening credits and was present when the show aired on ABC as well as syndication, but was replaced in the DVD releases of all seasons except 1 episode due to licensing costs. At the [[9th ALMA Awards]] in 2007, George Lopez called the song the \"[[Chicano]] National Anthem\".\n\n== Cancellation ==\nThe series finale aired on May 8, 2007, after the show was canceled by ABC.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | title = TV Series Finale - 2007 Canceled Shows: ABC Cuts Some Beloved Series | publisher = TV Series Finale | accessdate = 2007-05-15 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070517044954/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | archivedate = 2007-05-17}}</ref> According to Lopez, ABC prime-time entertainment president Steve McPherson called him over the weekend and explained that the network would lose money if the show was picked up again, and that it wasn't doing well financially.<ref name=lopez-lashes-out>{{Citation | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | title = George Lopez lashes out at ABC - Los Angeles Times | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2014-06-25 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014192002/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | archivedate = 2013-10-14}}</ref> Lopez stated that the explanation was \"painful to hear,\" noting that the show had four different time slots in only five years and had to constantly compete against shows like ''[[American Idol]]'', yet the final season of the show was still able to outperform a comedy series that was renewed by ABC: ''[[Notes from the Underbelly]]''. Lopez said that ABC \"dealt with us from the bottom of the deck\" and that it was \"hard to take after what was a good run.\"<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> In spite of not finishing its 21 episode run, there were many unaired episodes,  many of which were used in \"Saint George\". Thirteen episodes of season seven had been written, which amounted to half of the planned season.\n\nLopez attributed the cancellation in part to the fact that the show was not produced directly by ABC Studios, but instead by Warner Bros. Television.<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> Lopez also criticized ABC's decision to approve the show ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', being perplexed at the circumstances: \"So a Chicano can't be on TV, but a caveman can?\" According to Lopez, 170 staff members who worked on the show lost their jobs. Lopez explained that he \"took the five years of good, and I did a lot with the good. My popularity, I was involved in charities, I overcame my illness, all on TV. I shared all of that with America \u2013 every secret I had... Every emotion. Everything was open to the show. And what happens?\"<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> In spite of the cancellation, nightly episode re-runs continue to air on various networks both in the United States and abroad (see the \"Syndication\" section below).\n\nOn September 2, 2016, George Lopez announced through his Instagram that there are talks to bringing the show back on the air, but nothing has been announced.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe series is produced by [[Sandra Bullock|Fortis Films]] and [[Mohawk Productions]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]].\n\n=== Broadcast and syndication ===\nThe show entered syndication one month after the series finale on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and is distributed by [[Warner Bros.

It is currently in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] on [[Nick at Nite]], and stars the titular comedian George Lopez, who plays a fictionalized version of himself and revolves around his life at work and raising his family at home.\n\n== Series synopsis ==\n[[File:GeorgeLopezsitcomcast.jpg|thumb|left|The season 4 cast of ''George Lopez'' (from left to right): Valente Rodriguez as Ernie Cardenas, Constance Marie with Luis Armand Garcia as Angie and Max Lopez, Emiliano D\u00edez as Vic Palmero, Belita Moreno as Benny Lopez, George Lopez as George Lopez, and Masiela Lusha as Carmen Lopez.]]\n\nThe comedy revolves around a fictionalized portrayal of Lopez who works at the Powers Brothers aviation factory, and raises daughter Carmen and son Max with wife Angie after surviving a miserable, dysfunctional childhood at the hands of his neglectful [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother Benny, who is portrayed as selfish and cold-hearted. Other characters include Angie's indulgent father, [[wealth]]y [[physician|doctor]] Vic Palmero; and George's best [[childhood]] [[friendship|friend]] Ernie Cardenas, noted for his socially-awkward behavior and unsuccessful attempts at dating. After Carmen's departure from the series, Angie's overindulged niece Veronica moved in, laden with a large trust fund that is entrusted to George's care.\n\nMultiple storylines in the series are established through the unveiling of a secret guarded by Benny throughout George's whole childhood, most notably the discovery that his father Manny is still alive after Benny had convinced George that he died. Throughout much of the series George tries to locate his father; when Manny is finally introduced, he turns out to be a nasty but successful [[Businessperson|businessman]] who is now married to a woman named Lydia with whom he has more children. Manny's personality was commonly depicted as being [[Verbal abuse|abusive]] toward his son and former wife in his few appearances before he dies of [[Chronic kidney disease|kidney disease]]. Much to George's fury, Manny has prohibited his son's family from attending his [[funeral]] in protection of his reputation.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of George Lopez episodes}}\n{{:List of George Lopez episodes}}\n<!-- To edit the table in this section, you need to edit the table in [[List of George Lopez episodes]]. -->\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of George Lopez characters}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Character\n! scope=col rowspan=2 | Portrayed by\n! scope=col colspan=6 | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 1: 2002|1]]\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 2: 2002\u201303|2]]\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 3: 2003\u201304|3]]\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 4: 2004\u201305|4]]\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 5: 2005\u201306|5]]\n! scope=col style=\"min-width:4em;\"| [[List of George Lopez episodes#Season 6: 2007|6]]\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#George Lopez|George Edward Lopez]]\n| [[George Lopez]]\n| colspan=6 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Angie Lopez|Angelina \"Angie\" Lopez (n\u00e9e Palmero)]]\n| [[Constance Marie]]\n| colspan=6 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Ernie Cardenas|Ernesto \"Ernie\" Cardenas]]\n| [[Valente Rodriguez]]\n| colspan=6 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Max Lopez|Maximilian \"Max\" Victor Roberto Magic Johnson Lopez]]\n| Luis Armand Garcia\n| colspan=6 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Carmen Lopez|Carmen Consuela Lopez]]\n| [[Masiela Lusha]]\n| colspan=5 {{CMain}}\n| colspan=1 {{CAlso starring|[[Archival footage|Archival]]}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Benny Lopez|Benita \"Benny\" Lopez (n\u00e9e Diaz)]]\n| [[Belita Moreno]]\n| colspan=6 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Vic Palmero|Dr. Victor \"Vic\" Garcia Lantigua Palmero]]\n| [[Emiliano D\u00edez]]\n| colspan=1 {{CNone}}\n| colspan=2 {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=3 {{CMain}}\n|-\n| scope=row | [[List of George Lopez characters#Veronica Palmero|Veronica Ann Palmero]]\n| [[Aimee Garcia]]\n| colspan=4 {{CNone}}\n| colspan=1 {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=1 {{CMain}}\n|}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nComedian George Lopez had been performing standup throughout the early 1990s, expressing interest in having his own comedy television show like ''[[Seinfeld]]''.<ref name=latimes-90s-standup>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-11/entertainment/ca-3674_1_george-lopez |title=Getting Funny, Not Angry : Comedy: George Lopez deals with the stereotyping of Latinos by using humor to help fight the slights.

During the show's fifth season, [[Aimee Garcia]] was cast as George's niece, Veronica.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe show's theme song is \"[[Low Rider]]\", performed by [[War (U.S. band)|War]]. The theme plays in the opening credits and was present when the show aired on ABC as well as syndication, but was replaced in the DVD releases of all seasons except 1 episode due to licensing costs. At the [[9th ALMA Awards]] in 2007, George Lopez called the song the \"[[Chicano]] National Anthem\".\n\n== Cancellation ==\nThe series finale aired on May 8, 2007, after the show was canceled by ABC.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | title = TV Series Finale - 2007 Canceled Shows: ABC Cuts Some Beloved Series | publisher = TV Series Finale | accessdate = 2007-05-15 | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070517044954/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php | archivedate = 2007-05-17}}</ref> According to Lopez, ABC prime-time entertainment president Steve McPherson called him over the weekend and explained that the network would lose money if the show was picked up again, and that it wasn't doing well financially.<ref name=lopez-lashes-out>{{Citation | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | title = George Lopez lashes out at ABC - Los Angeles Times | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2014-06-25 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131014192002/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/15/entertainment/et-lopez15 | archivedate = 2013-10-14}}</ref> Lopez stated that the explanation was \"painful to hear,\" noting that the show had four different time slots in only five years and had to constantly compete against shows like ''[[American Idol]]'', yet the final season of the show was still able to outperform a comedy series that was renewed by ABC: ''[[Notes from the Underbelly]]''. Lopez said that ABC \"dealt with us from the bottom of the deck\" and that it was \"hard to take after what was a good run.\"<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> In spite of not finishing its 21 episode run, there were many unaired episodes,  many of which were used in \"Saint George\". Thirteen episodes of season seven had been written, which amounted to half of the season.\n\nLopez attributed the cancellation in part to the fact that the show was not produced directly by ABC Studios, but instead by Warner Bros. Television.<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> Lopez also criticized ABC's decision to approve the show ''[[Cavemen (TV series)|Cavemen]]'', being perplexed at the circumstances: \"So a Chicano can't be on TV, but a caveman can?\" According to Lopez, 170 staff members who worked on the show lost their jobs. Lopez explained that he \"took the five years of good, and I did a lot with the good. My popularity, I was involved in charities, I overcame my illness, all on TV. I shared all of that with America \u2013 every secret I had... Every emotion. Everything was open to the show. And what happens?\"<ref name=lopez-lashes-out/> In spite of the cancellation, nightly episode re-runs continue to air on various networks both in the United States and abroad (see the \"Syndication\" section below).\n\nOn September 2, 2016, George Lopez announced through his Instagram that there are talks to bringing the show back on the air, but nothing has been announced.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe series is produced by [[Sandra Bullock|Fortis Films]] and [[Mohawk Productions]] in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]].\n\n=== Broadcast and syndication ===\nThe show entered syndication one month after the series finale on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and is distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]]. The show aired in broadcast syndication on independent stations, and affiliates of Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV as well as [[The CW Plus]] stations in the United States from 2007-2011 and on [[Telelatino]] in Canada. The show moved to [[ION Television]] on Thursday, Sept. 29, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pavan -- SitcomsOnline.com |url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/09/ion-television-fall-2011-schedule-now.html |title=ION Television Fall 2011 Schedule Now Has George Lopez; Centric Weekend Marathons - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog |publisher=Blog.sitcomsonline.com |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140301140949/http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/09/ion-television-fall-2011-schedule-now.html |archivedate=2014-03-01 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 8, 2007, it was announced that ''George Lopez'' would join the [[Nick at Nite]] lineup.
