In the first edition of the ''[[English Pronouncing Dictionary]]'' (1917), he named the accent \"Public School Pronunciation\" (\"[[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]]\" being what Americans would term \"private\"), but for the second edition in 1926, he wrote, \"In what follows I call it Received Pronunciation, for want of a better term.\"{{sfnp|Jones|1926|p=ix}} However, the term had actually been used much earlier by [[Peter Stephen Du Ponceau|P. S. Du Ponceau]] in 1818.{{sfnp|DuPonceau|1818|p=259}} A similar term, ''received standard,'' was coined by [[H. C. Wyld|Henry C. K. Wyld]] in 1927.{{sfnp|Wyld|1927|p=23}} The early phonetician [[Alexander John Ellis]] used both terms interchangeably but with a much broader definition than Daniel Jones, having said \"there is no such thing as a uniform eduction pron. of English, and rp. and rs. is a variable quantity differing from individual to individual, although all its varieties are 'received', understood and mainly unnoticed\".{{sfnp|Ellis|1869|p=3}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (1965), the correct term is \"'the Received Pronunciation'. The word 'received' conveys its original meaning of 'accepted' or 'approved', as in '[[wiktionary:received#Adjective|received]] wisdom'.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/find-out-more/received-pronunciation/ |publisher=British Library|title=Regional Voices \u2013 Received Pronunciation}}</ref>\n\nRP is often believed to be based on the accents of [[southern England]], but it actually has most in common with the [[Early Modern English]] dialects of the [[East Midlands]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Jonnie |title=Received Pronunciation |url=https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/articles/received-pronunciation |website=British Library |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> This was the most populated and most prosperous area of England during the 14th and 15th centuries.

They may also modify their [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]] to approach those of [[Standard English]] for the same reason. RP serves as the standard for English in most books on general [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]], and most dictionaries published in the United Kingdom use RP in their pronunciation schemes.{{citation needed |date= January 2019}} Most British voices in apps like [[Siri]] and [[Google Assistant]] speak RP, and most TV and radio stations across the UK use this accent.\n\n===In dictionaries===\nMost English dictionaries published in Britain (including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') now give phonetically transcribed RP pronunciations for all words. Pronunciation dictionaries represent a special class of dictionary giving a wide range of possible pronunciations; British pronunciation dictionaries are all based on RP, though not necessarily using that name. Daniel Jones transcribed RP pronunciations of a large number of words and names in the ''English Pronouncing Dictionary''.{{sfnp|Jones|1917}} Cambridge University Press continues to publish this title,{{sfnp|Jones|2011}} {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} edited by [[Peter Roach (phonetician)|Peter Roach]], the accent having been renamed \"BBC Pronunciation\". Two other pronunciation dictionaries are in common use: the ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'',{{sfnp|Wells|2008}} compiled by [[John C. Wells]] (using the name \"Received Pronunciation\"), and the ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English'',{{sfnp|Upton|Kretzschmar|Konopka|2001}} compiled by [[Clive Upton]]. This represents an accent named BR (\"British English\") \u2013 based on RP, but claimed to be representative of a wider group of speakers. An earlier pronunciation dictionary by [[Jack Windsor Lewis|J. Windsor Lewis]] gives both British and American pronunciations, using the terms General British (GB) for the former and General American (GA) for the latter.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Windsor Lewis|first= J.\n|title= A Concise Pronouncing Dictionary of British and American English\n|date= 1972|publisher= Oxford\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Status==\nTraditionally, Received Pronunciation was the \"everyday speech in the families of [[Southern English (England)|Southern English]] persons whose men-folk [had] been educated at the great public boarding-schools\"{{sfnp|Jones|1917|p=viii}} and which conveyed no information about that speaker's region of origin before attending the school.\n\n{{bq|text=It is the business of educated people to speak so that no-one may be able to tell in what county their childhood was passed.|sign=A.

It is common in parts of Britain to regard it as a south-eastern English accent rather than a non-regional one and as a symbol of the south-east's political power in Britain.{{sfnp|McArthur|2002|p=43}} Based on a 1997 survey, Jane Stuart-Smith wrote, \"RP has little status in [[Glasgow]], and is regarded with hostility in some quarters\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Stuart-Smith|first=Jane|title=Urban Voices|chapter=Glasgow: accent and voice quality|page=204|editor-last1=Foulkes|editor-first1=Paul|editor-last2=Docherty|editor-first2=Gerard|year=1999|isbn=0340706082|publisher=Arnold}}</ref> A 2007 survey found that residents of Scotland and Northern Ireland tend to dislike RP.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scottish and Irish accents top list of favourites |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/scottish-and-irish-accents-top-list-of-favourites-448630.html |work=The Independent |date=13 May 2007}}</ref> It is shunned by some with [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political views, who may be proud of having an accent more typical of the [[working class]]es.{{sfnp|McArthur|2002|p=49}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+Consonant phonemes{{sfnp|Roach|2004|pp=240\u2013241}}\n!\n!colspan=2| [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=2| [[Interdental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br>alveolar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! <small>[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]</small>\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" | || width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|m}}\n|colspan=2|\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" | || width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|n}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" | || width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|\u014b}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n! <small>[[Stop consonant|Stop]]</small>\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPA link|p}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|b}}\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPA link|t}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|d}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPA link|k}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|\u0261}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n! <small>[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]</small>\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" |{{IPA link|t\u0283}}|| width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|d\u0292}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n! <small>[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]</small>\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" |{{IPA link|f}}|| width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|v}}\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" |{{IPA link|\u03b8}}|| width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|\u00f0}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPA link|s}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|z}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"|{{IPA link|\u0283}}||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|\u0292}}\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" |{{IPA link|h}}|| width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |\n|-\n!rowspan=1| <small>[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]</small>\n|colspan=2|\n|colspan=2|\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|l}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|\u0279|r}}\n| width=\"20\" style=\"border-right: 0;\" | || width=\"20\" style=\"border-left: 0;\" |{{IPA link|j}}\n|style=\"border-right: 0;\"| ||style=\"border-left: 0;\"|{{IPA link|w}}\n|colspan=2|\n|-\n|}\n\nNasals and [[liquid consonant|liquids]] ({{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}) may be [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]] in [[unstressed syllable]]s.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}} The consonant in 'row', 'arrow' in RP is generally a [[postalveolar approximant]],{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}} which would normally be expressed with the sign {{IPA|[\u0279]}} in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], but the sign {{IPA|/r/}} is nonetheless traditionally used for RP in most of the literature on the topic.\n\n[[Voiceless plosive]]s ({{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}) are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] at the beginning of a syllable, unless a completely unstressed vowel follows. (For example, the {{IPA|/p/}} is aspirated in \"impasse\", with primary stress on \"-passe\", but not \"compass\", where \"-pass\" has no stress.) Aspiration does not occur when {{IPA|/s/}} precedes in the same syllable, as in \"spot\" or \"stop\". When a [[sonorant]] {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, or {{IPA|/j/}} follows, this aspiration is indicated by partial [[devoicing]] of the [[sonorant]].{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}} {{IPA|/r/}} is a [[Voiceless postalveolar non-sibilant fricative|fricative]] when devoiced.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}}\n\nSyllable final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} may be either preceded by a [[glottal stop]] ([[Glottalization#Glottal reinforcement|glottal reinforcement]]) or, in the case of {{IPA|/t/}}, fully replaced by a glottal stop, especially before a [[syllabic nasal]] (''bitten'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u026a\u0294n\u0329]}}).{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}}{{sfnp|Gimson|1970}} The glottal stop may be realised as [[creaky voice]]; thus, an alternative phonetic transcription of ''attempt'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8t\u02b0em\u0294t]}} could be {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8t\u02b0emm\u0330t]}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}}\n\nAs in other varieties of English, voiced plosives ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) are partly or even fully devoiced at utterance boundaries or adjacent to [[voiceless consonants]]. The voicing distinction between voiced and voiceless sounds is reinforced by a number of other differences, with the result that the two of consonants can clearly be distinguished even in the presence of devoicing of voiced sounds:\n\n#Aspiration of voiceless consonants syllable-initially.\n#Glottal reinforcement of voiceless consonants syllable-finally.\n#Lengthening of vowels before voiced consonants.\n\nAs a result, some authors prefer to use the terms \"[[fortis and lenis|fortis]]\" and \"lenis\" in place of \"voiceless\" and \"voiced\". However, the latter are traditional and in more frequent usage.\n\nThe voiced dental fricative ({{IPA|/\u00f0/}}) is more often a weak [[dental plosive]]; the sequence {{IPA|/n\u00f0/}} is often realised as {{IPA|[n\u032an\u032a]}} (a long [[dental nasal]]).{{sfnp|Lodge|2009|pp=148\u201349}}{{sfnp|Shockey|2003|pp=43\u201344}}{{sfnp|Roach|2009|p=112}} {{IPA|/l/}} has [[velarisation|velarised]] [[allophone]] ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) in the [[syllable rime|syllable rhyme]].{{sfnp|Halle|Mohanan|1985|p=65}} {{IPA|/h/}} becomes voiced ({{IPA|[\u0266]}}) between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] sounds.{{sfnp|Jones|1967|p=201}}{{sfnp|Cruttenden|2008|p=204}}\n\n===Vowels===\n[[Image:RP English monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|Monophthongs of a fairly conservative variety of RP.

The predominant realisation in contemporary RP is [[monophthong]]al.{{sfnp|Gimson|2014|p=118}}\n\n====Long and short vowels====\nRP's long [[high vowel]]s {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} are slightly [[diphthong]]ised, and are often narrowly transcribed in phonetic literature as diphthongs {{IPA|[\u026ai]}} and {{IPA|[\u028au]}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|p=24}}\n\nThe terms \"long\" and \"short\" are relative to each other when applied to the vowel [[phoneme]]s of RP. Vowels may be phonologically long or short (i.e. belong to the long or the short group of vowel phonemes) but their length is influenced by their context: in particular, they are shortened if a voiceless ([[fortis consonant|fortis]]) consonant follows in the syllable, so that, for example, the vowel in 'bat' {{IPA|[b\u00e6\u0294t]}} is shorter than the vowel in 'bad' {{IPA|[b\u00e6d]}}. The process is known as [[Clipping (phonetics)|''pre-fortis clipping'']]. Thus phonologically short vowels in one context can be phonetically ''longer'' than phonologically long vowels in another context.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}} For example, the phonologically long vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in 'reach' {{IPA|/ri\u02d0t\u0283/}} (which ends with a voiceless consonant) may be ''shorter'' than the phonologically short vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in the word 'ridge' {{IPA|/r\u026ad\u0292/}} (which ends with a voiced consonant). Wiik,{{sfnp|Wiik|1965}} cited in Cruttenden (2014), published durations of English vowels with a mean value of 17.2 csec. for short vowels before voiced consonants but a mean value of 16.5 csec for long vowels preceding voiceless consonants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=101|edition=8th}}</ref>\n\nIn [[natural speech]], the plosives {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} often have no audible release utterance-finally, and voiced consonants are partly or completely devoiced (as in {{IPA|[b\u0325\u00e6d\u0325]}}); thus the perceptual distinction between pairs of words such as 'bad' and 'bat', or 'seed' and 'seat' rests mostly on vowel length (though the presence or absence of glottal reinforcement provides an additional cue).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=165|edition=8th}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to such length distinctions, unstressed vowels are both shorter and more centralised than stressed ones. In unstressed syllables occurring before vowels and in final position, contrasts between long and short high vowels are neutralised and short {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} occur (e.g. ''happy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u00e6pi]}}, ''throughout'' {{IPA|[\u03b8\u0279u\u02c8a\u028a\u0294t]}}).{{sfnp|Roach|2004|pp=241, 243}} The neutralisation is common throughout many English dialects, though the phonetic realisation of e.g. {{IPA|[i]}} rather than {{IPA|[\u026a]}} (a phenomenon called [[happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]]) is not as universal.\n\nUnstressed vowels vary in quality:\n* {{IPA|/i/}} (as in {{sc2|HAPP{{underline|Y}}}}) ranges from close front {{IPAblink|i}} to close-mid retracted front {{IPAblink|e|e\u0320}};<ref name=\"wellsxxv\">{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|2008|p=XXV}}</ref>\n* {{IPA|/u/}} (as in {{sc2|INFL{{underline|U}}ENCE}}) ranges from close advanced back {{IPAblink|u|u\u031f}} to close-mid retracted central {{IPAblink|\u0275|\u0275\u0320}};<ref name=\"wellsxxv\"/> according to the phonetician [[Jane Setter]], the typical pronunciation of this vowel is a weakly rounded, mid-centralized [[close back unrounded vowel]], transcribed in the IPA as {{IPAblink|\u028a|u\u031c\u033d}} or simply {{IPAblink|\u028a|\u028a\u031c}};<ref>{{cite web|title=A World of Englishes: Is {{IPA|/\u0259/}} \"real\"?|url=http://aworldofenglishes.blogspot.com/2013/06/is-real.html|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref>\n* {{IPA|/\u0259/}} (as in {{sc2|COMM{{underline|A}}}}) ranges from close-mid central {{IPAblink|\u0258}} to open-mid central {{IPAblink|\u025c}}.<ref name=\"wellsxxv\"/>\n\n====Diphthongs and triphthongs====\n[[Image:RP English diphthongs chart.svg|thumb|Diphthongs of RP.

The vowel {{IPA|/\u0254\u0259/}} (as in \"door\", \"boar\") had largely merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} by the Second World War, and the vowel {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} (as in \"poor\", \"tour\") has more recently merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} as well among most speakers,{{sfnp|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=200}} although the sound {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} is still found in conservative speakers. See [[Pour\u2013poor merger|poor\u2013pour merger]]. The remaining centring glide {{IPA|/\u026a\u0259/}} is increasingly pronounced as a monophthong {{IPA|[\u026a\u02d0]}}, although without merging with any existing vowels.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}}\n\nThe diphthong /\u0259\u028a/ is pronounced by some RP speakers in a noticeably different way when it occurs before /l/, if that consonant is [[Syllable final|syllable-final]] and not followed by a vowel (the context in which /l/ is pronounced as a \"dark l\"). The realization of /\u0259\u028a/ in this case begins with a more back, rounded and sometimes more open vowel quality; it may be transcribed as [\u0254\u028a] or [\u0252\u028a]. It is likely that the backness of the diphthong onset is the result of [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation caused by the raising of the back of the tongue for the /l/. If the speaker has \"l-vocalization\" the /l/ is realized as a back rounded vowel, which again is likely to cause backing and rounding in a preceding vowel as [[coarticulation]] effects. This phenomenon has been discussed in several blogs by [[John C. Wells]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog July 2006|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0607.htm|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog July 2009|url=http://www.phonetic-blog.blogspot.fr/2009_10_01_archive.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog Nov 2009|url=http://www.phonetic-blog.blogspot.fr/2009_11_01_archive.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> In the recording included in this article the phrase 'fold his cloak' contains examples of the /\u0259\u028a/ diphthong in the two different contexts. The onset of the pre-/l/ diphthong in 'fold' is slightly more back and rounded than that in 'cloak', though the allophonic transcription does not at present indicate this.\n\nRP also possesses the [[triphthong]]s {{IPA|/a\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''tire'', {{IPA|/a\u028a\u0259/}} as in ''tower'', {{IPA|/\u0259\u028a\u0259/}} as in ''lower'', {{IPA|/e\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''layer'' and {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''loyal''. There are different possible realisations of these items: in slow, careful speech they may be pronounced as a two-syllable triphthong with three distinct vowel qualities in succession, or as a monosyllabic triphthong. In more casual speech the middle vowel may be considerably reduced, by a process known as [[smoothing (phonetics)|smoothing]], and in an extreme form of this process the triphthong may even be reduced to a single vowel, though this is rare, and almost never found in the case of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a\u0259/}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|pp=18\u201319}} In such a case the difference between {{IPA|/a\u028a\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/a\u026a\u0259/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} in ''tower'', ''tire'', and ''tar'' may be [[Archiphoneme|neutralised]] with all three units realised as {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e4\u02d0]}}.

This contrasts with many [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]] and [[East Midlands English|East Midland]] varieties of [[English language in England]] and with many forms of [[American English]], including [[General American]]. Hence also ''pursuit'' is commonly heard with {{IPA|/j/}} and ''revolutionary'' less so but more commonly than ''evolution''. For a subset of these, a yod has been lost over time: for example, in all of the words beginning ''suit'', however the yod is sometimes deliberately reinserted in historical or stressed contexts such as \"a suit in chancery\" or \"suitable for an aristocrat\".\n* The [[flapping|flapped]] variant of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (as in much of the West Country, Ulster, most North American varieties including General American, Australian English, and the [[Cape Coloured]] dialect of South Africa) is not used very often. \n* RP has undergone [[wine\u2013whine merger|''wine''\u2013''whine'' merger]] (so the sequence {{IPA|/hw/}} is not present except among those who have acquired this distinction as the result of speech training).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=228 ff}} The [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], based in London, still teaches these two sounds for international breadth as distinct phonemes. They are also distinct from one another in most of Scotland and Ireland, in the northeast of England, and in the southeastern United States.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=228 ff}}\n* Unlike some other varieties of [[English language in England]], there is no [[h-dropping|''h''-dropping]] in words like ''head'' or ''horse''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=253 ff}} As shown in the spoken specimen below, in hurried phrases such as \"as hard as he could\" h-dropping commonly applies to the word ''he''.\n* Unlike most [[Southern Hemisphere English]] accents, RP has not undergone the [[weak-vowel merger]], meaning that pairs such as ''Lenin''/''Lennon'' are distinct.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=167 ff}}\n*In traditional RP {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/r/}} (it is used intervocalically, after {{IPA|/\u03b8}}, {{IPA|\u00f0/}} and sometimes even after {{IPA|/b}}, {{IPA|\u0261/}}).{{sfnp|Wise|1957}}{{sfnp|Cruttenden|2008|pp=221}}\n\n==Conservative RP==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\nConservative Received Pronunciation is a conservative standard of pronunciation of [[British English]]. Formerly the prestige model of pronunciation, it has declined in favour of other, less-conservative dialects, primarily Contemporary Received Pronunciation (Contemporary RP) also known as ''Modern RP''. Conservative RP is the standard adhered to in the First and Second Editions of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which, starting with the Third edition, has been modelled on Contemporary RP.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Other terms for Conservative RP are ''Traditional RP'' and ''Upper RP'' (the latter in reference to the association of the standard to the upper class and aristocracy). Notable speakers of Conservative RP include [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and other older members of the [[British Royal Family]], [[Sir Winston Churchill]] and commentators of [[Path\u00e9 News]] and, prior to the 1960s, the [[BBC]].\n\nThe phonological features of Conservative RP which are distinct from Contemporary RP, include:\n\n===Vowels and diphthongs===\n* [[Happy tensing]]: this feature concerns the vowel at the end of words ending in {{angbr|y}}, {{angbr|ie}}, {{angbr|ee}}, etc., which is normally transcribed with the symbol {{angbr IPA|i}}. In Conservative RP, this vowel can be assigned to the {{IPA|/\u026a/}} phoneme, whereas in Contemporary RP it can be assigned to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} phoneme, as it is more tense.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/vowel-sounds-rp/ |title=Received Pronunciation |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2016-04-13}}</ref>\n* The phonetic realization of the {{IPA|/e/}} phoneme is more close ({{IPAblink|e}}) than in Contemporary RP, in which it is more open {{IPAblink|\u025b}}. The more closed realization is also found in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Similarly, the quality of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} phoneme is {{IPAblink|\u00e6}}, akin to [[General American]] and [[General Australian]]. However, the majority of Contemporary RP speakers realize this vowel as fully open {{IPAblink|a}}, as do speakers from Northern England and Scotland.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* The quality of the {{sc2|NURSE}} vowel {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} is realised as {{IPAblink|\u0250\u02d0}} by some conservative speakers, and {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u025c\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0259\u02d0}}]}} by others. In Contemporary RP, the {{IPAblink|\u0250\u02d0}} realization is not heard.\n* Many terms have {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in Conservative RP, yet {{IPA|/\u0252/}} in the speech of Contemporary RP speakers, including ''cross'', ''often'', ''cloth'', ''salt'', ''because'', ''gone'',  etc. Similarly, the term ''mass'' (with reference to the Catholic ritual) may be pronounced as {{IPA|/m\u0251\u02d0s/}} by conservative speakers, with ''data'' also possessing this vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0t\u0259/}}. For Contemporary RP speakers, the former tends to have the short {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} vowel, whereas the latter has a diphthong {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* In some cases, where Contemporary RP has the schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, Conservative RP preserves {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, for instance, the final vowel in the following: ''devil'', ''kindness'', ''witness'', ''private'', ''toilet'', ''fortunate''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Contemporary RP speakers realize {{IPA|/\u0259\u028a/}} as {{IPA|[\u0254\u028a]}} before the dark l ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}), so that ''goal'' has a different vowel from ''goat''. This allophone is not used by conservative speakers.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Two diphthongs which exist in Conservative RP may not in Contemporary RP. The first has disappeared in the speech of all but the most conservative British speakers and some speakers of Southern American English, the [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|hoarse-horse distinction]]. For speakers who differentiate, ''hoarse'' is realised as {{IPA|/h\u0254\u0259s/}} and ''horse'' is {{IPA|/h\u0254\u02d0s/}}. The vowel in words such as ''tour'', ''moor'', ''sure'' is {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} for all Conservative RP speakers, but has merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} for many Contemporary speakers. Taking the two mergers into account, results in a number of three-way mergers, which were hitherto distinct, such as ''poor'', ''paw'' and ''pore'' ({{IPA|/p\u028a\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/p\u0254\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/p\u0254\u0259/}}) all becoming {{IPA|/p\u0254\u02d0/}}.\n* The {{IPA|/\u025b\u0259/}} phoneme (as in ''fair'', ''care'', ''there'') is realized as a true centring diphthong {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}} in the conservative variety, whereas speakers of Contemporary RP tend to realise it as a long monophthong {{IPAblink|\u025b\u02d0}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* The {{IPA|/e\u026a/}} phoneme has a somewhat different starting point in the conservative variety, namely {{IPA|[e\u026a]}}. For Contemporary speakers, this vowel tends to be realised as {{IPA|[\u025b\u026a]}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Consonants===\n* Unlike with vowels and diphthongs, consonantal phonemes have not undergone change, with one exception. For speakers of Conservative Received Pronunciation in the late 19th century, it was standard for the consonant combination {{angbr|wh}} to be realised as {{IPA|/\u028d/}} (also transcribed {{IPA|/hw/}}), as can still be heard in the 21st century in the speech of many speakers in Ireland and Scotland and a large minority in the Southern United States. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the {{IPA|/\u028d/}} phoneme ceased to be a feature of Conservative RP, except by the most precise speakers who have learnt to differentiate, meaning it has ceased to be a native feature of English outside Ireland, Scotland (and some bordering areas of England) and the Southern United States.\n\n==Spoken specimen==\n{{listen\n|filename=Recording of speaker of British English (Received Pronunciation).ogg\n|title=Specimen of Received Pronunciation\n|description=The audio recording on which the transcriptions are based\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association]]'' regularly publishes \"Illustrations of the IPA\" which present an outline of the phonetics of a particular language or accent.

They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.{{sfnp|Roach|2004}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Notable speakers==\nThe following people have been described as RP speakers:\n<!--Don't add names unless appropriately cited-->\n*[[David Attenborough]], broadcaster and naturalist<ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=David Attenborough |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/11/david-attenborough.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n* The [[British Royal Family]]<ref name=\"Wells 2011\">{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=the evidence of the vows |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/05/evidence-of-vows.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=3 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=Any young U-RP speakers? |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0707a.htm}}</ref>\n* [[David Cameron]], former Prime Minister of the UK (2010\u20132016)<ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=EE, yet again |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/04/ee-yet-again.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=8 April 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]], aristocrat and writer<ref name=\"woods\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8684273/When-I-didnt-know-owt-about-posh-speak.html|title=When I didn't know owt about posh speak|first=Vicki|last=Woods|date=5 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n*[[Judi Dench]], actress<ref name=\"lawson\">{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Lindsey|date=14 October 2013|url=http://www.thevoicecafe.net/the-voice-cafe-blog/the-accent-with-few-native-speakers-in-Britain-RP|title=A popular British accent with very few native speakers|work=The Voice Cafe|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Rupert Everett]], actor<ref name=\"Wells 2008\"/>\n* [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], author and historian<ref name=\"woods\"/>\n* [[Christopher Hitchens]], late author and journalist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/british-accents/|title=British Accents|date=25 January 2011|work=dialectblog.com}}</ref>\n* [[Boris Johnson]], Prime Minister of the UK (2019\u2013present)<ref name=\"Wells 2008\">{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=RP back in fashion? |date=12 June 2008 |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0806a.htm}}</ref>\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]], actress<ref name=\"lawson\"/>\n* [[Helen Mirren]], actress<ref>Klaus J.

In the first edition of the ''[[English Pronouncing Dictionary]]'' (1917), he named the accent \"Public School Pronunciation\" (\"[[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]]\" being what Americans would term \"private\"), but for the second edition in 1926, he wrote, \"In what follows I call it Received Pronunciation, for want of a better term.\"{{sfnp|Jones|1926|p=ix}} However, the term had actually been used much earlier by [[Peter Stephen Du Ponceau|P. S. Du Ponceau]] in 1818.{{sfnp|DuPonceau|1818|p=259}} A similar term, ''received standard,'' was coined by [[H. C. Wyld|Henry C. K. Wyld]] in 1927.{{sfnp|Wyld|1927|p=23}} The early phonetician [[Alexander John Ellis]] used both terms interchangeably but with a much broader definition than Daniel Jones, having said \"there is no such thing as a uniform eduction pron. of English, and rp. and rs. is a variable quantity differing from individual to individual, although all its varieties are 'received', understood and mainly unnoticed\".{{sfnp|Ellis|1869|p=3}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]]'' (1965), the correct term is \"'the Received Pronunciation'. The word 'received' conveys its original meaning of 'accepted' or 'approved', as in '[[wiktionary:received#Adjective|received]] wisdom'.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/find-out-more/received-pronunciation/ |publisher=British Library|title=Regional Voices \u2013 Received Pronunciation}}</ref>\n\nRP is often believed to be based on the accents of [[southern England]], but it actually has most in common with the [[Early Modern English]] dialects of the [[East Midlands]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Jonnie |title=Received Pronunciation |url=https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/articles/received-pronunciation |website=British Library |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> This was the most populated and most prosperous area of England during the 14th and 15th centuries.

Pronunciation dictionaries represent a special class of dictionary giving a wide range of possible pronunciations; British pronunciation dictionaries are all based on RP, though not necessarily using that name.

Two other pronunciation dictionaries are in common use: the ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary'',{{sfnp|Wells|2008}} compiled by [[John C. Wells]] (using the name \"Received Pronunciation\"), and the ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English'',{{sfnp|Upton|Kretzschmar|Konopka|2001}} compiled by [[Clive Upton]]. This represents an accent named BR (\"British English\") \u2013 based on RP, but claimed to be representative of a wider group of speakers.

(For example, the {{IPA|/p/}} is aspirated in \"impasse\", with primary stress on \"-passe\", but not \"compass\", where \"-pass\" has no stress.) Aspiration does not occur when {{IPA|/s/}} precedes in the same syllable, as in \"spot\" or \"stop\". When a [[sonorant]] {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/w/}}, or {{IPA|/j/}} follows, this aspiration is indicated by partial [[devoicing]] of the [[sonorant]].{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}} {{IPA|/r/}} is a [[Voiceless postalveolar non-sibilant fricative|fricative]] when devoiced.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}}\n\nSyllable final {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} may be either preceded by a [[glottal stop]] ([[Glottalization#Glottal reinforcement|glottal reinforcement]]) or, in the case of {{IPA|/t/}}, fully replaced by a glottal stop, especially before a [[syllabic nasal]] (''bitten'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u026a\u0294n\u0329]}}).{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}}{{sfnp|Gimson|1970}} The glottal stop may be realised as [[creaky voice]]; thus, an alternative phonetic transcription of ''attempt'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8t\u02b0em\u0294t]}} could be {{IPA|[\u0259\u02c8t\u02b0emm\u0330t]}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}}\n\nAs in other varieties of English, voiced plosives ({{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) are partly or even fully devoiced at utterance boundaries or adjacent to [[voiceless consonants]]. The voicing distinction between voiced and voiceless sounds is reinforced by a number of other differences, with the result that the two of consonants can clearly be distinguished even in the presence of devoicing of voiced sounds:\n\n#Aspiration of voiceless consonants syllable-initially.\n#Glottal reinforcement of voiceless consonants syllable-finally.\n#Lengthening of vowels before voiced consonants.\n\nAs a result, some authors prefer to use the terms \"[[fortis and lenis|fortis]]\" and \"lenis\" in place of \"voiceless\" and \"voiced\".

Vowels may be phonologically long or short (i.e. belong to the long or the short group of vowel phonemes) but their length is influenced by their context: in particular, they are shortened if a voiceless ([[fortis consonant|fortis]]) consonant follows in the syllable, so that, for example, the vowel in 'bat' {{IPA|[b\u00e6\u0294t]}} is shorter than the vowel in 'bad' {{IPA|[b\u00e6d]}}. The process is known as [[Clipping (phonetics)|''pre-fortis clipping'']]. Thus phonologically short vowels in one context can be phonetically ''longer'' than phonologically long vowels in another context.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=241}} For example, the phonologically long vowel {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} in 'reach' {{IPA|/ri\u02d0t\u0283/}} (which ends with a voiceless consonant) may be ''shorter'' than the phonologically short vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in the word 'ridge' {{IPA|/r\u026ad\u0292/}} (which ends with a voiced consonant). Wiik,{{sfnp|Wiik|1965}} cited in Cruttenden (2014), published durations of English vowels with a mean value of 17.2 csec. for short vowels before voiced consonants but a mean value of 16.5 csec for long vowels preceding voiceless consonants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=101|edition=8th}}</ref>\n\nIn [[natural speech]], the plosives {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} often have no audible release utterance-finally, and voiced consonants are partly or completely devoiced (as in {{IPA|[b\u0325\u00e6d\u0325]}}); thus the perceptual distinction between pairs of words such as 'bad' and 'bat', or 'seed' and 'seat' rests mostly on vowel length (though the presence or absence of glottal reinforcement provides an additional cue).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cruttenden|first1=Alan|title=Gimson's Pronunciation of English|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781444183092|page=165|edition=8th}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to such length distinctions, unstressed vowels are both shorter and more centralised than stressed ones. In unstressed syllables occurring before vowels and in final position, contrasts between long and short high vowels are neutralised and short {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[u]}} occur (e.g. ''happy'' {{IPA|[\u02c8h\u00e6pi]}}, ''throughout'' {{IPA|[\u03b8\u0279u\u02c8a\u028a\u0294t]}}).{{sfnp|Roach|2004|pp=241, 243}} The neutralisation is common throughout many English dialects, though the phonetic realisation of e.g. {{IPA|[i]}} rather than {{IPA|[\u026a]}} (a phenomenon called [[happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]]) is not as universal.\n\nUnstressed vowels vary in quality:\n* {{IPA|/i/}} (as in {{sc2|HAPP{{underline|Y}}}}) ranges from close front {{IPAblink|i}} to close-mid retracted front {{IPAblink|e|e\u0320}};<ref name=\"wellsxxv\">{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|2008|p=XXV}}</ref>\n* {{IPA|/u/}} (as in {{sc2|INFL{{underline|U}}ENCE}}) ranges from close advanced back {{IPAblink|u|u\u031f}} to close-mid retracted central {{IPAblink|\u0275|\u0275\u0320}};<ref name=\"wellsxxv\"/> according to the phonetician [[Jane Setter]], the typical pronunciation of this vowel is a weakly rounded, mid-centralized [[close back unrounded vowel]], transcribed in the IPA as {{IPAblink|\u028a|u\u031c\u033d}} or simply {{IPAblink|\u028a|\u028a\u031c}};<ref>{{cite web|title=A World of Englishes: Is {{IPA|/\u0259/}} \"real\"?|url=http://aworldofenglishes.blogspot.com/2013/06/is-real.html|accessdate=5 March 2016}}</ref>\n* {{IPA|/\u0259/}} (as in {{sc2|COMM{{underline|A}}}}) ranges from close-mid central {{IPAblink|\u0258}} to open-mid central {{IPAblink|\u025c}}.<ref name=\"wellsxxv\"/>\n\n====Diphthongs and triphthongs====\n[[Image:RP English diphthongs chart.svg|thumb|Diphthongs of RP.

The vowel {{IPA|/\u0254\u0259/}} (as in \"door\", \"boar\") had largely merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} by the Second World War, and the vowel {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} (as in \"poor\", \"tour\") has more recently merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} as well among most speakers,{{sfnp|Roca|Johnson|1999|p=200}} although the sound {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} is still found in conservative speakers. See [[Pour\u2013poor merger|poor\u2013pour merger]]. The remaining centring glide {{IPA|/\u026a\u0259/}} is increasingly pronounced as a monophthong {{IPA|[\u026a\u02d0]}}, although without merging with any existing vowels.{{sfnp|Roach|2004|p=240}}\n\nThe diphthong /\u0259\u028a/ is pronounced by some RP speakers in a noticeably different way when it occurs before /l/, if that consonant is [[Syllable final|syllable-final]] and not followed by a vowel (the context in which /l/ is pronounced as a \"dark l\"). The realization of /\u0259\u028a/ in this case begins with a more back, rounded and sometimes more open vowel quality; it may be transcribed as [\u0254\u028a] or [\u0252\u028a]. It is likely that the backness of the diphthong onset is the result of [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation caused by the raising of the back of the tongue for the /l/. If the speaker has \"l-vocalization\" the /l/ is realized as a back rounded vowel, which again is likely to cause backing and rounding in a preceding vowel as [[coarticulation]] effects. This phenomenon has been discussed in several blogs by [[John C. Wells]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog July 2006|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0607.htm|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog July 2009|url=http://www.phonetic-blog.blogspot.fr/2009_10_01_archive.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John|title=Blog Nov 2009|url=http://www.phonetic-blog.blogspot.fr/2009_11_01_archive.html|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> In the recording included in this article the phrase 'fold his cloak' contains examples of the /\u0259\u028a/ diphthong in the two different contexts. The onset of the pre-/l/ diphthong in 'fold' is slightly more back and rounded than that in 'cloak', though the allophonic transcription does not at present indicate this.\n\nRP also possesses the [[triphthong]]s {{IPA|/a\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''tire'', {{IPA|/a\u028a\u0259/}} as in ''tower'', {{IPA|/\u0259\u028a\u0259/}} as in ''lower'', {{IPA|/e\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''layer'' and {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a\u0259/}} as in ''loyal''. There are different possible realisations of these items: in slow, careful speech they may be pronounced as a two-syllable triphthong with three distinct vowel qualities in succession, or as a monosyllabic triphthong. In more casual speech the middle vowel may be considerably reduced, by a process known as [[smoothing (phonetics)|smoothing]], and in an extreme form of this process the triphthong may even be reduced to a single vowel, though this is rare, and almost never found in the case of {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a\u0259/}}.{{sfnp|Roach|2009|pp=18\u201319}} In such a case the difference between {{IPA|/a\u028a\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/a\u026a\u0259/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} in ''tower'', ''tire'', and ''tar'' may be [[Archiphoneme|neutralised]] with all three units realised as {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e4\u02d0]}}.

RP is sometimes known as '''the Queen's English''', but recordings show that even [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has changed her pronunciation over the past 50 years, no longer using an {{IPA|[\u025b]}}-like vowel in words like ''land''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003859.html|title=Happy-tensing and coal in sex|author=Language Log|authorlink=Language Log|date=5 December 2006}}</ref> \n[[Image:RP vowel movement.png|thumb|350px|A comparison of the [[formant]] values of {{IPA|/i\u02d0 \u00e6 \u0251\u02d0 \u0254\u02d0 \u028a u\u02d0/}} for older (black) and younger (light blue) RP speakers.

This contrasts with many [[East Anglian English|East Anglian]] and [[East Midlands English|East Midland]] varieties of [[English language in England]] and with many forms of [[American English]], including [[General American]]. Hence also ''pursuit'' is commonly heard with {{IPA|/j/}} and ''revolutionary'' less so but more commonly than ''evolution''. For a subset of these, a yod has been lost over time: for example, in all of the words beginning ''suit'', however the yod is sometimes deliberately reinserted in historical or stressed contexts such as \"a suit in chancery\" or \"suitable for an aristocrat\".\n* The [[flapping|flapped]] variant of {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (as in much of the West Country, Ulster, most North American varieties including General American, Australian English, and the [[Cape Coloured]] dialect of South Africa) is not used very often. \n* RP has undergone [[wine\u2013whine merger|''wine''\u2013''whine'' merger]] (so the sequence {{IPA|/hw/}} is not present except among those who have acquired this distinction as the result of speech training).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=228 ff}} The [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], based in London, still teaches these two sounds for international breadth as distinct phonemes. They are also distinct from one another in most of Scotland and Ireland, in the northeast of England, and in the southeastern United States.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=228 ff}}\n* Unlike some other varieties of [[English language in England]], there is no [[h-dropping|''h''-dropping]] in words like ''head'' or ''horse''.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=253 ff}} As shown in the spoken specimen below, in hurried phrases such as \"as hard as he could\" h-dropping commonly applies to the word ''he''.\n* Unlike most [[Southern Hemisphere English]] accents, RP has not undergone the [[weak-vowel merger]], meaning that pairs such as ''Lenin''/''Lennon'' are distinct.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|pp=167 ff}}\n*In traditional RP {{IPA|[\u027e]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/r/}} (it is used intervocalically, after {{IPA|/\u03b8}}, {{IPA|\u00f0/}} and sometimes even after {{IPA|/b}}, {{IPA|\u0261/}}).{{sfnp|Wise|1957}}{{sfnp|Cruttenden|2008|pp=221}}\n\n==Conservative RP==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\nConservative Received Pronunciation is a conservative standard of pronunciation of [[British English]]. Formerly the prestige model of pronunciation, it has declined in favour of other, less-conservative dialects, primarily Contemporary Received Pronunciation (Contemporary RP) also known as ''Modern RP''. Conservative RP is the standard adhered to in the First and Second Editions of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which, starting with the Third edition, has been modelled on Contemporary RP.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Other terms for Conservative RP are ''Traditional RP'' and ''Upper RP'' (the latter in reference to the association of the standard to the upper class and aristocracy). Notable speakers of Conservative RP include [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and other older members of the [[British Royal Family]], [[Sir Winston Churchill]] and commentators of [[Path\u00e9 News]] and, prior to the 1960s, the [[BBC]].\n\nThe phonological features of Conservative RP which are distinct from Contemporary RP, include:\n\n===Vowels and diphthongs===\n* [[Happy tensing]]: this feature concerns the vowel at the end of words ending in {{angbr|y}}, {{angbr|ie}}, {{angbr|ee}}, etc., which is normally transcribed with the symbol {{angbr IPA|i}}. In Conservative RP, this vowel can be assigned to the {{IPA|/\u026a/}} phoneme, whereas in Contemporary RP it can be assigned to the {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} phoneme, as it is more tense.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/vowel-sounds-rp/ |title=Received Pronunciation |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2016-04-13}}</ref>\n* The phonetic realization of the {{IPA|/e/}} phoneme is more close ({{IPAblink|e}}) than in Contemporary RP, in which it is more open {{IPAblink|\u025b}}. The more closed realization is also found in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Similarly, the quality of the {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} phoneme is {{IPAblink|\u00e6}}, akin to [[General American]] and [[General Australian]]. However, the majority of Contemporary RP speakers realize this vowel as fully open {{IPAblink|a}}, as do speakers from Northern England and Scotland.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* The quality of the {{sc2|NURSE}} vowel {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} is realised as {{IPAblink|\u0250\u02d0}} by some conservative speakers, and {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u025c\u02d0}} ~ {{IPAplink|\u0259\u02d0}}]}} by others. In Contemporary RP, the {{IPAblink|\u0250\u02d0}} realization is not heard.\n* Many terms have {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} in Conservative RP, yet {{IPA|/\u0252/}} in the speech of Contemporary RP speakers, including ''cross'', ''often'', ''cloth'', ''salt'', ''because'', ''gone'',  etc. Similarly, the term ''mass'' (with reference to the Catholic ritual) may be pronounced as {{IPA|/m\u0251\u02d0s/}} by conservative speakers, with ''data'' also possessing this vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0t\u0259/}}. For Contemporary RP speakers, the former tends to have the short {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} vowel, whereas the latter has a diphthong {{IPA|/e\u026a/}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* In some cases, where Contemporary RP has the schwa {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, Conservative RP preserves {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, for instance, the final vowel in the following: ''devil'', ''kindness'', ''witness'', ''private'', ''toilet'', ''fortunate''.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Contemporary RP speakers realize {{IPA|/\u0259\u028a/}} as {{IPA|[\u0254\u028a]}} before the dark l ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}), so that ''goal'' has a different vowel from ''goat''. This allophone is not used by conservative speakers.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* Two diphthongs which exist in Conservative RP may not in Contemporary RP. The first has disappeared in the speech of all but the most conservative British speakers and some speakers of Southern American English, the [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|hoarse-horse distinction]]. For speakers who differentiate, ''hoarse'' is realised as {{IPA|/h\u0254\u0259s/}} and ''horse'' is {{IPA|/h\u0254\u02d0s/}}. The vowel in words such as ''tour'', ''moor'', ''sure'' is {{IPA|/\u028a\u0259/}} for all Conservative RP speakers, but has merged with {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}} for many Contemporary speakers. Taking the two mergers into account, results in a number of three-way mergers, which were hitherto distinct, such as ''poor'', ''paw'' and ''pore'' ({{IPA|/p\u028a\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/p\u0254\u02d0/}}, {{IPA|/p\u0254\u0259/}}) all becoming {{IPA|/p\u0254\u02d0/}}.\n* The {{IPA|/\u025b\u0259/}} phoneme (as in ''fair'', ''care'', ''there'') is realized as a true centring diphthong {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}} in the conservative variety, whereas speakers of Contemporary RP tend to realise it as a long monophthong {{IPAblink|\u025b\u02d0}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* The {{IPA|/e\u026a/}} phoneme has a somewhat different starting point in the conservative variety, namely {{IPA|[e\u026a]}}. For Contemporary speakers, this vowel tends to be realised as {{IPA|[\u025b\u026a]}}.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Consonants===\n* Unlike with vowels and diphthongs, consonantal phonemes have not undergone change, with one exception. For speakers of Conservative Received Pronunciation in the late 19th century, it was standard for the consonant combination {{angbr|wh}} to be realised as {{IPA|/\u028d/}} (also transcribed {{IPA|/hw/}}), as can still be heard in the 21st century in the speech of many speakers in Ireland and Scotland and a large minority in the Southern United States. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the {{IPA|/\u028d/}} phoneme ceased to be a feature of Conservative RP, except by the most precise speakers who have learnt to differentiate, meaning it has ceased to be a native feature of English outside Ireland, Scotland (and some bordering areas of England) and the Southern United States.\n\n==Spoken specimen==\n{{listen\n|filename=Recording of speaker of British English (Received Pronunciation).ogg\n|title=Specimen of Received Pronunciation\n|description=The audio recording on which the transcriptions are based\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Journal of the International Phonetic Association]]'' regularly publishes \"Illustrations of the IPA\" which present an outline of the phonetics of a particular language or accent.

They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.{{sfnp|Roach|2004}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==Notable speakers==\nThe following people have been described as RP speakers:\n<!--Don't add names unless appropriately cited-->\n*[[David Attenborough]], broadcaster and naturalist<ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=David Attenborough |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/11/david-attenborough.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n* The [[British Royal Family]]<ref name=\"Wells 2011\">{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=the evidence of the vows |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2011/05/evidence-of-vows.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=3 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=Any young U-RP speakers? |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0707a.htm}}</ref>\n* [[David Cameron]], former Prime Minister of the UK (2010\u20132016)<ref>{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=EE, yet again |url=http://phonetic-blog.blogspot.com/2010/04/ee-yet-again.html |website=John Wells's phonetic blog |date=8 April 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]], aristocrat and writer<ref name=\"woods\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8684273/When-I-didnt-know-owt-about-posh-speak.html|title=When I didn't know owt about posh speak|first=Vicki|last=Woods|date=5 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n*[[Judi Dench]], actress<ref name=\"lawson\">{{cite web|last=Lawson|first=Lindsey|date=14 October 2013|url=http://www.thevoicecafe.net/the-voice-cafe-blog/the-accent-with-few-native-speakers-in-Britain-RP|title=A popular British accent with very few native speakers|work=The Voice Cafe|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Rupert Everett]], actor<ref name=\"Wells 2008\"/>\n* [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], author and historian<ref name=\"woods\"/>\n* [[Christopher Hitchens]], late author and journalist<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/british-accents/|title=British Accents|date=25 January 2011|work=dialectblog.com}}</ref>\n* [[Boris Johnson]], Prime Minister of the UK (2019\u2013present)<ref name=\"Wells 2008\">{{cite web |last=Wells |first=John |title=RP back in fashion? |date=12 June 2008 |url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/blog0806a.htm}}</ref>\n* [[Vanessa Kirby]], actress<ref name=\"lawson\"/>\n* [[Helen Mirren]], actress<ref>Klaus J.

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight. Contrary to popular belief, he was not a Nazi Sympathizer. He was a strong advocate for isolationism & America First.{{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. Lindbergh's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy. In March 1932, his infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]] once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the granting of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission. In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist.\n\n==Rise to fame==\n===Early childhood===\n[[File:Charles&Dad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Charles A. Lindbergh and his father, circa 1910]]\n\nLindbergh was born in Detroit, Michigan on {{nowrap|February 4}}, 1902 and spent most of his childhood in Little Falls, Minnesota and Washington, D.C. He was the third child of [[Charles August Lindbergh]] ([[Name at birth|birth name]] Carl M\u00e5nsson; 1859\u20131924) who had emigrated from Sweden to [[Melrose, Minnesota]] as an infant, and his only child with his second wife, Evangeline Lodge Land Lindbergh (1876\u20131954), of Detroit. Charles' parents separated in 1909 when he was seven.<ref>Larson 1973, pp. 31\u201332.</ref> Lindbergh's father, a [[United States Congress|U.S. Congressman]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Minnesota|MN]]-6) from 1907 to 1917, was one of the few Congressmen to oppose the entry of the U.S. into World War I (although his Congressional term ended one month prior to the House of Representatives voting to declare war on Germany).<ref>Larson 1973, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref> His book, ''Why Is Your Country at War'', which criticized the US' entry into the first World War, was seized by federal agents under the Comstock Act.

Lindbergh also attended over a dozen other schools from Washington, D.C., to California, during his childhood and teenage years (none for more than a year or two), including the Force School and [[Sidwell Friends School]] while living in Washington with his father, and [[Redondo Union High School]] in [[Redondo Beach, California]], while living there with his mother.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 19\u201322.</ref> Although he enrolled in the College of Engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in late 1920, Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year and then went to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], in March 1922 to begin flight training.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp.&nbsp;22\u201325.</ref>\n\n===Early aviation career===\n[[File:Lincoln Standard biplane.jpg|thumb|left|[[Standard J|Lincoln Standard J]] biplane]]\n\nFrom an early age, Lindbergh had exhibited an interest in the mechanics of motorized transportation, including his family's [[Saxon (automobile)|Saxon Six]] automobile, and later his [[Excelsior Motor Manufacturing & Supply Company|Excelsior]] motorbike. By the time he started college as a [[mechanical engineering]] student, he had also become fascinated with flying, though he \"had never been close enough to a plane to touch it\".<ref>Lindbergh 1927, p. 23.</ref> After quitting college in February 1922, Lindbergh enrolled at the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation's flying school in Lincoln and flew for the first time on {{nowrap|April 9}}, as a passenger in a two-seat [[Standard J|Lincoln Standard \"Tourabout\"]] biplane trainer piloted by [[Otto Timm]].<ref>Lindbergh 1927, p. 25.</ref>\n\nA few days later, Lindbergh took his first formal flying lesson in that same machine, though he was never permitted to solo because he could not afford to post the requisite damage bond.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 26\u201328.</ref> To gain flight experience and earn money for further instruction, Lindbergh left Lincoln in June to spend the next few months [[barnstorming]] across Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana as a [[wing walking|wing walker]] and [[Parachuting|parachutist]].

Though Lindbergh had not touched an airplane in more than six months, he had already secretly decided he was ready to take to the air by himself. After a half-hour of dual time with a pilot who was visiting the field to pick up another surplus JN-4, Lindbergh flew solo for the first time in the Jenny he had just purchased for $500.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 39\u201343.</ref><ref>[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/plane/firstplane.asp \"Charles Lindbergh's First Solo Flight & First Plane\"].

In October, Lindbergh flew his Jenny to [[Iowa]], where he sold it to a flying student. After selling the Jenny, Lindbergh returned to Lincoln by train. There, he joined Leon Klink and continued to barnstorm through the South for the next few months in Klink's Curtiss JN-4C \"Canuck\" (the Canadian version of the Jenny). Lindbergh also \"cracked up\" this aircraft once when his engine failed shortly after take-off in [[Pensacola, Florida]], but again he managed to repair the damage himself.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 84\u201393.</ref>\n\nFollowing a few months of barnstorming through the South, the two pilots parted company in [[San Antonio]], Texas, where Lindbergh reported to [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]] on {{nowrap|March 19}}, 1924, to begin a year of military flight training with the [[United States Army Air Service]] there (and later at nearby [[Kelly Field Annex|Kelly Field]]).<ref>Berg 1998, p. 73.</ref> Lindbergh had his most serious flying accident on {{nowrap|March 5}}, 1925, eight days before graduation, when a midair collision with another Army [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5|S.E.5]] during aerial combat maneuvers forced him to bail out.<ref>Lindbergh 1927, pp. 144\u2013148.</ref> Only 18 of the 104 cadets who started flight training a year earlier remained when Lindbergh graduated first overall in his class in March 1925, thereby earning his Army pilot's wings and a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|2nd Lieutenant]] in the [[Military reserve force|Air Service Reserve Corps]].<ref>Moseley 1976, p. 56.</ref>{{refn|Dates of military rank: Cadet, Army Air Corps \u2013 March 19, 1924, 2nd Lieutenant, Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) \u2013 March 14, 1925, 1st Lieutenant, ORC \u2013 December 7, 1925, Captain, ORC \u2013 July 13, 1926, Colonel, ORC \u2013 July 18, 1927 (As of 1927, Lindbergh was a member of the Missouri National Guard and was assigned to the 110th Observation Squadron in St. Louis.<ref>Official National Guard Register. 1927. p. 529.</ref>), Brigadier General, USAFR \u2013 April 7, 1954.<ref>Berg 1998, p. 488.</ref>|group=N}}\n\nLindbergh later said that this year was critical to his development as both a focused, goal-oriented individual and as an aviator.{{refn|\"Always there was some new experience, always something interesting going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner years in a pilot's life.

At the age of 25 in 1927, he went from obscurity as a [[U.S. Air Mail]] pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the [[Orteig Prize]] for making a nonstop flight from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Paris]]. Lindbergh covered the {{frac|33|1|2}}-hour, {{convert|3,600|smi|km|adj=on}} flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] [[monoplane]], the  ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''. Although not the [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|first non-stop transatlantic flight]], this was the first solo [[transatlantic flight]], the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles, thus it is widely known as a turning point in the trajectory of aviation history and advancement.\n\nLindbergh was an officer in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve]], and he received the United States' highest military decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]], for his transatlantic flight. He was also a Nazi Sympathizer. {{sfn |Bryson |2013 |pp=25\u2013104}} His achievement spurred interest in both [[commercial aviation]] and [[air mail]], which revolutionized the aviation industry, and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. Lindbergh's historic flight and celebrity status also led to tragedy. In March 1932, his infant son, Charles Jr., [[Lindbergh kidnapping|was kidnapped and murdered]] in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century\". The case prompted the United States Congress to establish [[Federal Kidnapping Act|kidnapping as a federal crime]] once the kidnapper had crossed state lines with their victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from which they returned in 1939.\n\nIn the years before the United States entered [[World War II]], though Lindbergh never publicly stated support for [[Nazi Germany]], his [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance toward the war and statements about Jews led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer. He opposed not only the intervention of the United States, but also the granting of aid to the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charleslindbergh.com/americanfirst/|title=Charles Lindbergh's Noninterventionist Efforts & America First Committee|website=www.charleslindbergh.com}}</ref> He supported the anti-war [[America First Committee]] and resigned his commission in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] in April 1941 after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave an address stating that the British, the Jews and the Roosevelt administration were the \"three most important groups\" pressing for greater American involvement in the war. He also said capitalists, intellectuals, American Anglophiles, and communists were all agitating for war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|title=Charles Lindbergh's Sept 1 1941 Speech|website=www.historyonthenet.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621004336/http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1939-1945/2-homefront/1-prewardefense/19410901_Charles_Lindbergh_on_Neutrality.html|archivedate=June 21, 2019|accessdate=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLindbergh publicly supported the U.S. war effort after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[German declaration of war against the United States]]. He flew 50 missions in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of World War II as a civilian consultant,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Colonel Lindbergh On Combat Missions|newspaper=[[The San Bernardino Daily Sun]]|location=San Bernardino, California|date=23 October 1944|volume=51|page=1}}</ref> but did not take up arms against Germany, and Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission.

{"title_page": "Elections in Cyprus", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=March 2013}}\n{{Essay-like|date=January 2018}}\n}}\n\n{{Politics of Cyprus}}\n'''Elections in Cyprus''' gives information on [[election]] and election results in [[politics of Cyprus|Cyprus]].\n\n==Elections==\n[[Cyprus]] elects on national level a [[head of state]] - the [[President (government title)|president]] -  and a [[legislature]]. The election of the President is [[Direct election|direct]], by [[universal suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]]. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The election of a new President takes place before the expiration of the five-year period of office of the outgoing President so as to enable the newly elected President to be invested on the date that period expires.\n\nElections are managed by the Central Elections Office which is part of the Ministry of Interior. The Permanent Secretary of the MoI serves as the General Returning Officer (GRO). At the district level, the permanent chief district officers act as District Returning Officers.\n\nVoting was [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] and every citizen over the age of 18 had to vote, by law. On May 31, 2017, the cabinet approved a bill abolishing compulsory voting in elections, formally ending a law that has been inactive for years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/05/31/government-abolishes-compulsory-voting/|title=Government abolishes compulsory voting|date=May 31, 2017|publisher=Cyprus Mail}}</ref>\n\nCandidates for election must be citizens of the Republic of Cyprus and over 35 years of age.\nIf there is only one candidate for election, he is declared elected.\n\nA candidate to be elected needs more than 50% of the votes validly cast. If none of the candidates attains the required majority the election is repeated on the corresponding day of the following week between the two candidates who received the greater number of votes. The candidate who receives the greatest number of votes at these repeated elections is deemed elected.\n\nIf there is a vacancy in the office of Presidential, the vacancy is filled by a by-election taking place within a period not exceeding 45 days of the occurrence of such a vacancy.\n\nIn the event of a temporary absence or incapacity of the President to perform his duties, the President of the House of Representatives acts for him.\n\nThe [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]] (''Vouli Antipros\u00f3pon/Temsilciler Meclisi'') has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members  by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Maronite]], [[Roman-Catholic]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community. \nCyprus has a [[multi-party]] system, with two or three strong [[political parties|parties]] and a third party that is electorally successful.\n\nAccording to article 62(1) of the Constitution the number of representatives is 50. Out of this number 35 are elected by the [[Greek Cypriot]] Community and 15 by the [[Turkish Cypriot]] Community. The Turkish Cypriot seats remain vacant since 1964 when the Turkish Cypriot representatives withdrew from the House.\n\nHowever, for the smooth running of the House of Representatives and of the Committees in particular, the House decided in July 1985 by adopting law 124, to increase the seats to 80. Of these 56 (70%) representatives are elected by the Greek Cypriot Community and 24 (30%) by the Turkish Cypriot Community, as provided in article 62(2) of the Constitution.\n\n==Latest elections==\n\n===2018 presidential election===\n{{main|2018 Cypriot presidential election}}\n\n[[File:CypElec 2018.png|thumb|350px|right|A map of the first round's results.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|Candidate\n!rowspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|First round \n!colspan=2|Second round\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Democratic Rally/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Nicos Anastasiades]]||align=left|[[Democratic Rally]]||137,268||35.51||215,281||55.99\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Progressive Party of Working People/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Stavros Malas]]||align=left|[[Progressive Party of Working People]]||116,920||30.24||169,243||44.01\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Democratic Party (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Nikolas Papadopoulos]]||align=left|[[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]]||99,508||25.74||colspan=2 rowspan=7|\n|-\n|bgcolor={{ELAM (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|Christos Christou||align=left|[[ELAM (Cyprus)|ELAM]]||21,846||5.65\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Giorgos Lillikas]]||align=left|[[Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)|Citizens' Alliance]]||8,419||2.18\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Andreas Efstratiou||align=left|Independent||845||0.22\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Charis Aristeidou||align=left|Independent||752||0.19\n|-\n| ||align=left|Michail Mina||align=left|Organisation of Justice Fighters ||662||0.17\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Christakis Kapiliotis||align=left|Independent||391||0.10\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Invalid/blank votes||9,338||\u2013||22,951||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|'''Total'''||'''395,949'''||'''100'''||'''407,475'''||'''100'''\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Registered voters/turnout||550,876||71.88||550,876||73.97\n|-\n|align=left colspan=7|Source: [http://europeanpolling.com/election-result-cyprus-presidency-2018-first-round European Polling Report], [http://www.ekloges.gov.cy/English/ Central Electoral Service]\n|}\n\n===2016 legislative election===\n{{main| 2016 Cypriot legislative election}}\n{{2016 Cypriot legislative election}}\n\n===2013 presidential election===\n{{main| 2013 Cypriot presidential election, 2013}}\n{{Cypriot presidential election}}\n\n==Past elections==\n\nThe British colonial administration drafted a constitution for Cyprus a few years after Cyprus was bought from the [[Ottomans]] (1878). The legislative assembly was to have 9 [[Greek Cypriot]] members, 3 [[Turkish Cypriot]] members (all elected) and 6 [[United Kingdom|British]] ex officio members. The vote of the British head of the assembly weighted more in case of a 50%-50% disagreement. Thus traditionally the Turkish Cypriot and British members would cooperate and pass legislation despite the disagreements of the [[Greek Cypriot]] members. In 1931 Necati Bey, a Turkish Cypriot supporter of [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] was elected (in previous years Turkish Cypriot members were hailed from the Ottoman ruling class). Necati Bey agreed with the Greek Cypriot members on several issues. This made the British governor, [[Sir Ronald Storrs]] to ignore the assembly when passing the bills. Angry Greek Cypriot members started a riot and the constitution was abolished.\n\nThe first municipal elections happened in 1943. Two of the winning mayors were members of [[AKEL]]: [[Ploutis Servas]] in [[Limassol]] and Adam Adamantos in [[Famagusta]], and the other six where Greek [[nationalism|nationalists]]. In 1946 the situation was reversed: 6 were either members or supported by AKEL, including Ioannis Klerides in [[Nicosia]].\n\n===Presidential elections===\nThe first presidential elections for independent Cyprus took place in 1960. The bulk of [[EOKA]] supporters were in favour of [[Makarios III]], whereas AKEL backed Ioannis Kleridis (father of [[Glafkos Klerides]]). Klerides was also backed by independent politicians, both left wingers  like [[Ploutis Servas]] and right wingers like Themistoklis Dervis. The Turkish Cypriot community elected  [[Fazil K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck]] for the position of vice president unopposed.\n\nThe next elections were due in 1965, but were postponed as a result of the extraordinary situation created by the intercommunal strife. The term of office was extended by a law of the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident Makarios distanced himself from his earlier ''enosis'' convictions in his 1968 presidential campaign and argued for the independence of Cyprus. He declared that [[Enosis]] was wishable but independence was possible. His opponent was the psychiatrist Takis Evdokas who was campaigning for Enosis. Makarios won the election. Turkish Cypriots were not participating in the government (see [[Cyprus dispute]]) but they had separate elections were Fazil K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck was reelected as vice president.\n\nIn 1973, Makarios was reelected unopposed.\n\nFollowing the death of Makarios in 1977, the then President of the House of Representatives, Spyros Kyprianou, assumed duties temporarily until 1978 elections.\n\nIn the 1978 election, Glafkos Klerides was backed by his party, [[Democratic Rally]] whereas [[Spyros Kyprianou]] was backed by the other Greek Cypriot parties. Following the kidnapping of Kyprianou's son, Achilleas, Klerides did not run for the election and Kyprianou won.\n\nIn 1983, Kyprianou's [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] forged an alliance with AKEL based on an agreed agenda: the so-called minimum program. Kyprianou was reelected in the presidential elections of that year. He was opposed by Glafcos Clerides, the leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party and Vassos Lyssarides of the [[Socialist]] party, EDEK.\n\nBy 1985, AKEL was not satisfied with Kyprianou's policies, especially his position in negotiations (see [[Cyprus dispute]] for more) and the partnership collapsed. AKEL found its new candidate for the 1988 election in [[George Vasiliou]] who managed to get to the second round of elections together with Glafkos Klerides. Kyprianou did not get enough votes. With the added support of [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]], whose candidate Vasos Lyssaridis did not do very well in the first round, Vasiliou won the second round.\n\nWhile the Democratic Rally had been supporting Vasiliou in negotiating the [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Ghali]] set of ideas, as the 1993 elections were approaching it started criticising Vasiliou for not demanding enough. At the same time a partnership of Kyprianou's democratic party and Lyssaridis's EDEK was rejecting the spirit of the Ghali ideas all together and argued that both Vasiliou and Klerides were equally willing to compromise. The partnership received strong support by the [[Church of Cyprus|Church]] and its candidate was Paschalis Paschalidis.\n\nPaschalidis did not make it to the second round, however the democratic party made an agreement with Klerides and supported him. Thus Klerides was elected in 1993,defeating George Vassiliou, who again ran as an Independent candidate supported by AKEL and ADISOK, forming a government with members of both Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe main issue of the 1998 election campaign was the purchase of S-300 antiaircraft missiles from [[Russia]]. Klerides was backed by EDEK whereas the democratic party and AKEL were backing George Iacovou, ex minister in the Kyprianou and Vasiliou governments. Klerides won the election.\n\nFor the 2003 election, EDEK leader Yiannakis Omirou declared himself candidate and the democratic rally initially backed him. Because of the course of negotiations Clerides asked to remain president for another couple of years, so the democratic rally backed him. This made EDEK turn to the opposition coalition already formed between AKEL and Democratic Party. The leader of the latter, [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] was chosen as a candidate. In the meantime the attorney general Alekos Markides disagreed with his party, Democratic Rally and ran as an independent candidate. \nPapadopoulos won from the first round.\n\n===Parliamentary elections===\nThe 1960 parliamentary elections were contested by three parties and a number of independent candidates. The right-wing \"Patriot Front\" won 30 seats, [[left-wing]] AKEL won five seats while the Pancyprian Union of Fighters did not win any seats.  No parliamentary elections were held in 1965 because of the prevailing intercommunal tension.\n\nFive parties contested the 5 July 1970 elections. Three of these, the Unified Party, the Progressive Front, and the opposition Democratic National Party, were [[right-wing]]; one, the Unified Democratic Union of Centre (EDEK), of the centre; and the other, AKEL, left-wing.\n\nThe third parliamentary elections took place on 5 September 1976, two years after the Turkish invasion. It was contested by the Democratic Rally, the Democratic Front (Democratic Party), [[socialist]] EDEK and left-wing AKEL. The right-wing Democratic Rally received about 26% of the votes, but due to a coalition ranged against it, was left with no Deputies.\n\nThe fourth parliamentary elections took place on 24 May 1981. The elections were contested by the right-wing Democratic Rally, the centre Democratic Party, the New Democratic Front and the Union of Centre, socialist EDEK and left-wing AKEL and PAME.\n\nIn the above election, a type of proportional system with threshold was used.\n\nThe fifth parliamentary elections took place on 8 December 1985. Following a law passed by the House of Representatives the number of seats allocated to the Greek Cypriot community was increased from 35 to 56. The number of Turkish Cypriot seats was raised from 15 to 24.\n\nThe elections were contested by four parties - the right-wing Democratic Rally, the centre Democratic Party, the socialist EDEK and left-wing AKEL - as well as independent candidates.\n\nVassos Lyssarides, leader of socialist party EDEK, was elected House President. His candidature was supported by his party and by the Democratic Party.\n\nThe sixth parliamentary elections took place on 19 May 1991. They were contested by the following political parties or party groupings - the Democratic Rally Party in coalition with the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party EDEK, AKEL-Left-New Forces Party and two new parties the Refugee Movement (PAKOP) and the Reformed Left (ADISOK), a splinter group from AKEL.\n\nAlexis Galanos (Democratic Party) was elected House President with the joint votes of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Rally - Liberals coalition.\n\nThe seventh parliamentary elections took place on 26 May 1996. They were held under a newly adopted system of [[proportional representation]] according to which a party receiving 1/56 of the valid votes or (1,79%) elected a House member. The new voting system encouraged the participation of more parties in the elections. The following political parties took part in the 1996 elections - the Democratic Rally - Liberal Party coalition, the New Horizons Party, the Democratic Party, the Movement of Free Democrats (of former President Vassiliou), the Ecologist Movement, the Socialist Party EDEK, the new Left (ADISOK) and the AKEL-Left-New Forces Party.\n\nSpyros Kyprianou was elected House President.\n\n==Referendums==\n[[Constitution of Cyprus]] has no mention of referendum (as of 2013).<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/all/1003AEDD83EED9C7C225756F0023C6AD/$file/CY_Constitution.pdf?openelement|title=Cyprus Constitution|accessdate=2013-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103050430/http://www.presidency.gov.cy/presidency/presidency.nsf/all/1003AEDD83EED9C7C225756F0023C6AD/$file/CY_Constitution.pdf?openelement|archive-date=2013-11-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> Cyprus is one of only two states not to hold the referendum on joining the [[European Union]] (the other being the [[United Kingdom]]).

The election of the President is [[Direct election|direct]], by [[universal suffrage]] and [[secret ballot]]. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The election of a new President takes place before the expiration of the five-year period of office of the outgoing President so as to enable the newly elected President to be invested on the date that period expires.\n\nElections are managed by the Central Elections Office which is part of the Ministry of Interior. The Permanent Secretary of the MoI serves as the General Returning Officer (GRO). At the district level, the permanent chief district officers act as District Returning Officers.\n\nVoting was [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] and every citizen over the age of 18 had to vote, by law. On May 31, 2017, the cabinet approved a bill abolishing compulsory voting in elections, formally ending a law that has been inactive for years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/05/31/government-abolishes-compulsory-voting/|title=Government abolishes compulsory voting|date=May 31, 2017|publisher=Cyprus Mail}}</ref>\n\nCandidates for election must be citizens of the Republic of Cyprus and over 35 years of age.\nIf there is only one candidate for election, he is declared elected.\n\nA candidate to be elected needs more than 50% of the votes validly cast. If none of the candidates attains the required majority the election is repeated on the corresponding day of the following week between the two candidates who received the greater number of votes. The candidate who receives the greatest number of votes at these repeated elections is deemed elected.\n\nIf there is a vacancy in the office of Presidential, the vacancy is filled by a by-election taking place within a period not exceeding 45 days of the occurrence of such a vacancy.\n\nIn the event of a temporary absence or incapacity of the President to perform his duties, the President of the House of Representatives acts for him.\n\nThe [[House of Representatives of Cyprus|House of Representatives]] (''Vouli Antipros\u00f3pon/Temsilciler Meclisi'') has 59 members elected for a five-year term, 56 members  by [[proportional representation]] and 3 observer members representing the [[Maronite]], [[Roman-Catholic]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]] minorities. 24 seats are allocated to the Turkish community. \nCyprus has a [[multi-party]] system, with two or three strong [[political parties|parties]] and a third party that is electorally successful.\n\nAccording to article 62(1) of the Constitution the number of representatives is 50. Out of this number 35 are elected by the [[Greek Cypriot]] Community and 15 by the [[Turkish Cypriot]] Community. The Turkish Cypriot seats remain vacant since 1964 when the Turkish Cypriot representatives withdrew from the House.\n\nHowever, for the smooth running of the House of Representatives and of the Committees in particular, the House decided in July 1985 by adopting law 124, to increase the seats to 80. Of these 56 (70%) representatives are elected by the Greek Cypriot Community and 24 (30%) by the Turkish Cypriot Community, as provided in article 62(2) of the Constitution.\n\n==Latest elections==\n\n===2018 presidential election===\n{{main|2018 Cypriot presidential election}}\n\n[[File:CypElec 2018.png|thumb|350px|right|A map of the first round's results.]]\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|Candidate\n!rowspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|First round \n!colspan=2|Second round\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Democratic Rally/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Nicos Anastasiades]]||align=left|[[Democratic Rally]]||137,268||35.51||215,281||55.99\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Progressive Party of Working People/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Stavros Malas]]||align=left|[[Progressive Party of Working People]]||116,920||30.24||169,243||44.01\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Democratic Party (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Nikolas Papadopoulos]]||align=left|[[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]]||99,508||25.74||colspan=2 rowspan=7|\n|-\n|bgcolor={{ELAM (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|Christos Christou||align=left|[[ELAM (Cyprus)|ELAM]]||21,846||5.65\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)/meta/color}}|\n|align=left|[[Giorgos Lillikas]]||align=left|[[Citizens' Alliance (Cyprus)|Citizens' Alliance]]||8,419||2.18\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Andreas Efstratiou||align=left|Independent||845||0.22\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Charis Aristeidou||align=left|Independent||752||0.19\n|-\n| ||align=left|Michail Mina||align=left|Organisation of Justice Fighters ||662||0.17\n|-\n|bgcolor={{Independent politician/meta/color}}| ||align=left|Christakis Kapiliotis||align=left|Independent||391||0.10\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Invalid/blank votes||9,338||\u2013||22,951||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|'''Total'''||'''395,949'''||'''100'''||'''407,475'''||'''100'''\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Registered voters/turnout||550,876||71.88||550,876||73.97\n|-\n|align=left colspan=7|Source: [http://europeanpolling.com/election-result-cyprus-presidency-2018-first-round European Polling Report], [http://www.ekloges.gov.cy/English/ Central Electoral Service]\n|}\n\n===2016 legislative election===\n{{main| 2016 Cypriot legislative election}}\n{{2016 Cypriot legislative election}}\n\n===2013 presidential election===\n{{main| 2013 Cypriot presidential election, 2013}}\n{{Cypriot presidential election}}\n\n==Past elections==\n\nThe British colonial administration drafted a constitution for Cyprus a few years after Cyprus was bought from the [[Ottomans]] (1878). The legislative assembly was to have 9 [[Greek Cypriot]] members, 3 [[Turkish Cypriot]] members (all elected) and 6 [[United Kingdom|British]] ex officio members. The vote of the British head of the assembly weighted more in case of a 50%-50% disagreement. Thus traditionally the Turkish Cypriot and British members would cooperate and pass legislation despite the disagreements of the [[Greek Cypriot]] members. In 1931 Necati Bey, a Turkish Cypriot supporter of [[Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] was elected (in previous years Turkish Cypriot members were hailed from the Ottoman ruling class). Necati Bey agreed with the Greek Cypriot members on several issues. This made the British governor, [[Sir Ronald Storrs]] to ignore the assembly when passing the bills. Angry Greek Cypriot members started a riot and the constitution was abolished.\n\nThe first municipal elections happened in 1943. Two of the winning mayors were members of [[AKEL]]: [[Ploutis Servas]] in [[Limassol]] and Adam Adamantos in [[Famagusta]], and the other six where Greek [[nationalism|nationalists]]. In 1946 the situation was reversed: 6 were either members or supported by AKEL, including Ioannis Klerides in [[Nicosia]].\n\n===Presidential elections===\nThe first presidential elections for independent Cyprus took place in 1960. The bulk of [[EOKA]] supporters were in favour of [[Makarios III]], whereas AKEL backed Ioannis Kleridis (father of [[Glafkos Klerides]]). Klerides was also backed by independent politicians, both left wingers  like [[Ploutis Servas]] and right wingers like Themistoklis Dervis. The Turkish Cypriot community elected  [[Fazil K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck]] for the position of vice president unopposed.\n\nThe next elections were due in 1965, but were postponed as a result of the extraordinary situation created by the intercommunal strife. The term of office was extended by a law of the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident Makarios distanced himself from his earlier ''enosis'' convictions in his 1968 presidential campaign and argued for the independence of Cyprus. He declared that [[Enosis]] was wishable but independence was possible. His opponent was the psychiatrist Takis Evdokas who was campaigning for Enosis. Makarios won the election. Turkish Cypriots were not participating in the government (see [[Cyprus dispute]]) but they had separate elections were Fazil K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck was reelected as vice president.\n\nIn 1973, Makarios was reelected unopposed.\n\nFollowing the death of Makarios in 1977, the then President of the House of Representatives, Spyros Kyprianou, assumed duties temporarily until 1978 elections.\n\nIn the 1978 election, Glafkos Klerides was backed by his party, [[Democratic Rally]] whereas [[Spyros Kyprianou]] was backed by the other Greek Cypriot parties. Following the kidnapping of Kyprianou's son, Achilleas, Klerides did not run for the election and Kyprianou won.\n\nIn 1983, Kyprianou's [[Democratic Party (Cyprus)|Democratic Party]] forged an alliance with AKEL based on an agreed agenda: the so-called minimum program. Kyprianou was reelected in the presidential elections of that year. He was opposed by Glafcos Clerides, the leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party and Vassos Lyssarides of the [[Socialist]] party, EDEK.\n\nBy 1985, AKEL was not satisfied with Kyprianou's policies, especially his position in negotiations (see [[Cyprus dispute]] for more) and the partnership collapsed. AKEL found its new candidate for the 1988 election in [[George Vasiliou]] who managed to get to the second round of elections together with Glafkos Klerides. Kyprianou did not get enough votes. With the added support of [[Movement for Social Democracy|EDEK]], whose candidate Vasos Lyssaridis did not do very well in the first round, Vasiliou won the second round.\n\nWhile the Democratic Rally had been supporting Vasiliou in negotiating the [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Ghali]] set of ideas, as the 1993 elections were approaching it started criticising Vasiliou for not demanding enough. At the same time a partnership of Kyprianou's democratic party and Lyssaridis's EDEK was rejecting the spirit of the Ghali ideas all together and argued that both Vasiliou and Klerides were equally willing to compromise. The partnership received strong support by the [[Church of Cyprus|Church]] and its candidate was Paschalis Paschalidis.\n\nPaschalidis didn't make it to the second round, however the democratic party made an agreement with Klerides and supported him. Thus Klerides was elected in 1993,defeating George Vassiliou, who again ran as an Independent candidate supported by AKEL and ADISOK, forming a government with members of both Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe main issue of the 1998 election campaign was the purchase of S-300 antiaircraft missiles from [[Russia]]. Klerides was backed by EDEK whereas the democratic party and AKEL were backing George Iacovou, ex minister in the Kyprianou and Vasiliou governments. Klerides won the election.\n\nFor the 2003 election, EDEK leader Yiannakis Omirou declared himself candidate and the democratic rally initially backed him. Because of the course of negotiations Clerides asked to remain president for another couple of years, so the democratic rally backed him. This made EDEK turn to the opposition coalition already formed between AKEL and Democratic Party. The leader of the latter, [[Tassos Papadopoulos]] was chosen as a candidate. In the meantime the attorney general Alekos Markides disagreed with his party, Democratic Rally and ran as an independent candidate. \nPapadopoulos won from the first round.\n\n===Parliamentary elections===\nThe 1960 parliamentary elections were contested by three parties and a number of independent candidates.

Through a broad and balanced, human and Christian education, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute guides the development of each student's unique talents, fostering a commitment to academic excellence, service, and leadership in the global community.\n\n==History==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2016}}\nThe History of St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is predated by only a few years by that of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo]], which was established on April 23, 1847. Very Rev John Timon, named the first Bishop of Buffalo by [[Pope Pius IX]], was consecrated in [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], New York City, on Sunday, October 17 and arrived in Buffalo on October 22, 1847.\n\nIn 1849, Bishop Timon moved into the Webster House on Franklin Street. Always concerned with vocations to the priesthood, he established in the rectory a [[seminary]] for three young men. The seminary was named St. Joseph's College because of a special veneration the bishop held for St. Joseph. Its early history was a varied one, as it moved from one location to another in several areas of the city.\n\nLater in 1850., Bishop Timon asked the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] to staff the seminary in his residence. On July 2, 1851, the Oblates arrived and opened a school chartered on March 12, 1851 under the name \"The Buffalo College of St. Joseph,\" which Bishop Timon said, \"...exists for missionary and no other purpose.\" In August 1861, six Christian Brothers from New York and Montreal arrived in Buffalo and settled at 187 Terrace Street. Brother Crispian, Director of this first Christian Brothers' community in Buffalo, Brother Pompian (Sub-Director), Brothers Demedrian, Ptolemy, Benedict and one Brother whose religious name is unknown had come to the city in response to Bishop Timon's urgent plea for assistance in educating the Catholic youth of Buffalo.\n\nThe first building in which the Brothers taught was built by a local contractor, a Mr. Flanagan, at a cost of $7,000. Two departments were started in this first school on September 2, 1861: St. Joseph's Academy (a tuition school), with 130 boys registered, and St. Joseph's Free School, with 150 boys. The brick building was located opposite Union Terrace, which at that time was a beautiful park. The Free School was located on the first floor of the building, the Academy on the second floor., and the Brothers dormitory on the third floor. This building, later known as \"Old Cathedral Hall,\" was located at 1 Delaware Avenue.\n\nIn response to numerous requests from clergy and parents, and after being closed for two years, St. Joseph's College reopened in September 1893. Due to the railroad station at Union Terrace and the encroachment of business and manufacturing interests, the Delaware Avenue site was no longer a desirable one. For what they knew would be a temporary stay, the Brothers rented a two-story brick building at 473 Prospect Avenue near Jersey Street which housed about fifty pupils during each of the four years the school occupied it.\n\nIn 1945, plans were again taken up for the \"new St. Joe's\" on Kenmore Avenue. Brother Andrew of the Cross-sponsored a drive to secure funds to commence the project. The proposed plan was to include three buildings: a general school building to accommodate 900 students, a gymnasium with three basketball courts and a [[seating capacity]] of 2000, and a faculty house with accommodations for thirty brothers. In addition, there were to be football and baseball fields, a quarter-mile cinder track, and facilities for other sports.\n\nThe first classes were held in the new building on April 19, 1950. In the years to follow, the new facility allowed for increases in both the size of the student body and the number of faculty members. Such facilities as a drafting room, photographic darkroom and a soda fountain were appealing to the students. The school also featured, according to news accounts of the day, such modern innovations\" as a public address system linking the principal's office to all rooms of the school and green glass chalkboards, replacing the old familiar blackboards.\" The new building was dedicated on May 14, 1950.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, it was announced that [http://buffalonews.com/2006/11/16/2-million-gift-to-st-joes-once-reluctant-student-makes-record-donation-to-town-of-tonawanda-high-school/ alumnus Jack Cullen] had made a gift of $2 million to support construction of new science laboratories and classrooms, as well as the annual school musical. This gift, along with two other $1 million gifts from alumni, are the foundation for [http://www.sjci.com/capital-campaign-announced.php a $12 million capital campaign] announced on May 15, 2007, to build new science laboratories, an athletic complex, and a new residence for the Christian Brothers on campus, as well as increasing the endowment for financial aid.\n\n==Facilities==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2016}}\nThe campus of St. Joseph\u2019s Collegiate Institute (SJCI or St. Joe's) is located at 845 Kenmore Avenue in the town of [[Tonawanda (town), New York|Tonawanda]]<ref name=\"USGS\">{{cite web|url=http://mapper.acme.com/?ll=42.95902,-78.84912&z=15&t=T&marker0=42.95902%2C-78.84912%2C845%20Kenmore%20Ave%5C%2C%20Buffalo%5C%2C%20NY|title=St. Joseph's collegiate Institute on USGS map|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref><ref name=\"buffalo ne quad\">{{cite map|url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=q8 |title=Buffalo NE Digital Raster Quadrangle|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|year=1989|scale=1:24,000|accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref> (near [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]) and rests on 11.9 acres (48,000 m\u00b2).

Through a broad and balanced, human and Christian education, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute guides the development of each student's unique talents, fostering a commitment to academic excellence, service, and leadership in the global community.\n\n==History==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2016}}\nThe History of St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute is predated by only a few years by that of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo]], which was established on April 23, 1847. Very Rev John Timon, named the first Bishop of Buffalo by [[Pope Pius IX]], was consecrated in [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], New York City, on Sunday, October 17 and arrived in Buffalo on October 22, 1847.\n\nIn 1849, Bishop Timon moved into the Webster House on Franklin Street. Always concerned with vocations to the priesthood, he established in the rectory a [[seminary]] for three young men. The seminary was named St. Joseph's College because of a special veneration the bishop held for St. Joseph. Its early history was a varied one, as it moved from one location to another in several areas of the city.\n\nLater in 1850., Bishop Timon asked the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] to staff the seminary in his residence. On July 2, 1851, the Oblates arrived and opened a school chartered on March 12, 1851 under the name \"The Buffalo College of St. Joseph,\" which Bishop Timon said, \"...exists for missionary and no other purpose.\" In August 1861, six Christian Brothers from New York and Montreal arrived in Buffalo and settled at 187 Terrace Street. Brother Crispian, Director of this first Christian Brothers' community in Buffalo, Brother Pompian (Sub-Director), Brothers Demedrian, Ptolemy, Benedict and one Brother whose religious name is unknown had come to the city in response to Bishop Timon's urgent plea for assistance in educating the Catholic youth of Buffalo.\n\nThe first building in which the Brothers taught was built by a local contractor, a Mr. Flanagan, at a cost of $7,000. Two departments were started in this first school on September 2, 1861: St. Joseph's Academy (a tuition school), with 130 boys registered, and St. Joseph's Free School, with 150 boys. The brick building was located opposite Union Terrace, which at that time was a beautiful park. The Free School was located on the first floor of the building, the Academy on the second floor., and the Brothers dormitory on the third floor. This building, later known as \"Old Cathedral Hall,\" was located at 1 Delaware Avenue.\n\nIn response to numerous requests from clergy and parents, and after being closed for two years, St. Joseph's College reopened in September 1893. Due to the railroad station at Union Terrace and the encroachment of business and manufacturing interests, the Delaware Avenue site was no longer a desirable one. For what they knew would be a temporary stay, the Brothers rented a two-story brick building at 473 Prospect Avenue near Jersey Street which housed about fifty pupils during each of the four years the school occupied it.\n\nIn 1945, plans were again taken up for the \"new St. Joe's\" on Kenmore Avenue. Brother Andrew of the Cross-sponsored a drive to secure funds to commence the project. The proposed plan was to include three buildings: a general school building to accommodate 900 students, a gymnasium with three basketball courts and a [[seating capacity]] of 2000, and a faculty house with accommodations for thirty brothers. In addition, there were to be football and baseball fields, a quarter-mile cinder track, and facilities for other sports.\n\nThe first classes were held in the new building on April 19, 1950. In the years to follow, the new facility allowed for increases in both the size of the student body and the number of faculty members. Such facilities as a drafting room, photographic darkroom and a soda fountain were appealing to the students. The school also featured, according to news accounts of the day, such modern innovations\" as a public address system linking the principal's office to all rooms of the school and green glass chalkboards, replacing the old familiar blackboards.\" The new building was dedicated on May 14, 1950.\n\nOn November 16, 2006, it was announced that [http://buffalonews.com/2006/11/16/2-million-gift-to-st-joes-once-reluctant-student-makes-record-donation-to-town-of-tonawanda-high-school/ alumnus Jack Cullen] had made a gift of $2 million to support construction of new science laboratories and classrooms, as well as the annual school musical.

Together, Doyle and Koch under the guidance of Executive producer Adam Boland, surpassed their incumbent opposition and market leaders, ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' on the [[Nine Network]]. They built the program from a virtually zero viewer base to be the leading breakfast television program in Australia and there it remained throughout Doyle's tenure on the program. She was then dubbed the 'Queen of Australian Brekky TV'.\n\nIn 2003, Doyle enjoyed a very public pregnancy with her second child, who was born in December of that year.\n\nDoyle was nominated for the Silver Logie as Most Popular Television Presenter in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.

The divorce case was being heard in the Victorian Children's Court and because the boy was only 14 years old he couldn't be named. But ''Sunrise'', as well as a number of other news outlets, including the ''[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and ''Today Tonight'', allegedly identified him and the journalists/presenters were charged with contempt of court. The journalists and presenters/hosts were all acquitted but the Seven Network, its news director, ''Today Tonight''{{'}}s executive producer and the ''Sunday Herald Sun'' and its editor-in-chief were convicted.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nWhile at the helm of Sunrise she was at the front line of many of Australia's biggest stories of the era including, but not limited to, [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] and the [[2010\u201311 Queensland floods]], and international stories such as the Royal Wedding.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, Doyle announced that she would be stepping down as ''Sunrise'' co-host to take on a national role within the Seven Network.
