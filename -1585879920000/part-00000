It was part of the Austro\u2013Hungarian War between [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]]. It marked the end of a series of sieges, whereas Hungary then controlled [[Styria]] and the [[Lower Austria]].\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:311St.Georgs Ritterorden Einsetzung durch Papst Paul II.jpg|left|thumb|170px|on 1 January 1469 in the presence of Emperor Frederick III Pope Paul II accolades Johann Siebenhirter the first Grand Master of the St. George's Knights in the Lateran Basilica]]\nThe city was alerted many times during the Austro-Hungarian War. First in 1477 [[Grand master (order)|Grand master]] [[Johann Siebenhirter]] of the newly founded (1469) [[Order of Saint George of Carinthia]] \"defenders of environment\" occupied the city in order to defend the city. They were order dedicated to defend the borders of Austrian lands from the Eastern menaces. Originally set against the Ottomans the order found itself in between [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias]] of Hungary and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] the latter who imposed as the founder knight of the order. Siebenhirter placed the headquarters of the Order from [[Millstatt]] to Wiener Neustadt. In May 1478 he commanded the cottars of the [[Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt|mortgaged Hungarian villages]] [[Kismarton]] and [[Frakn\u00f3]] \u2013 of which he was the captain of, and in which he had spawned the Ordership \u2013 to drudge-work in the fortification labour of the city. After the [[Siege of Vienna (1485)|siege of Vienna]] he visited Matthias to compromise the status of Neustadt. As a result, they concluded a truce regarding the territories owned by the Order and exchanged their [[prisoners of war]]. The treaty meant the immunization of the Order off the Austro-Hungarian war. This was a contradicting situation as Siebenhirter kept his captain office of Neustadt in the meantime. Siebenhirter also committed himself that his knights at [[Raach am Hochgebirge|Wartenstein]] would refuse any support request from the Emperor. Also he could continue to run the Order in the lands under Matthias' authority.<ref name=\"Dezs\u00e9nyi\" />\n\n==The siege==\n[[File:WrNeustadt Reckturm.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Tower at the northwestern corner of Wiener Neustadt's defensive wall]]\n[[Burg Wiener Neustadt|Wiener Neustadt]] was a well defended and equipped fortress town of its time. The town was surrounded by three ditches and a powerful rectangular chain of ashlar stone walls, the suburbs were protected by a wide waterditch against sudden attacks, with four gates exits on drawbridges to the city. At the Ungarthore ({{lang-en|Hungarian gate}}) stood the ducal castle with high walls and four stone towers. At the back the castle laid the Thiergarten enclosed by a deep moat. The surrounding area was swampy and gritty, which complicated the task of the besiegers. The fortifications were provided with arquebuses and machines with fire range of 2000 steps.\n\nAfter the [[Siege of Vienna (1485)|siege of Vienna]] [[Matthias Corvinus|King Matthias]] urged his troops to encircle Wiener Neustadt, which could pose a possible threat to the conquered lands in later times. He sent captains [[Stephen Z\u00e1polya]], Ladislaus Kanizsay, Jakob Sz\u00e9kely, Wilhelm Tettauer und Stephan B\u00e1thory to begin the siege in 1486. They constructed four siege towers. Upon the prediction of his astrologists he joined them on 13 January 1487 after one year of the siege.<ref name=\"Bonfini\">{{cite book\n |author        = Antonio Bonfini\n |authorlink    = Antonio Bonfini\n |title         = Rerum Hungaricum Decades\n |trans-title   = Ten Volumes of Hungarian Matters\n |publisher     = Balassi Kiad\u00f3 (reprint)\n |location      = [[Budapest]], Hungary\n |url           = http://tortenelmunk.multiply.com/journal?&page_start=120\n |accessdate    = 30 June 2011\n |language      = Hungarian\n |origyear      = 1568\n |chapter       = Negyedik tized \u2013 hatodik-nyolcadik k\u00f6nyv\n |trans-chapter = Fourth decade \u2013 sixth-eighth book\n |year          = 1995\n |isbn          = 963-506-040-8\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104931/http://tortenelmunk.multiply.com/journal?&page_start=120\n |archivedate   = 26 March 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter his arrival Matthias realized the errors made by his captains. He found the ring of siege not tight enough. He pulled the circle closer and several watchtowers were built. He inducted the rotation of the reserves in the siege shifts so he was always able to assault with fresh soldiers. The [[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]] was ordered to attack the suburbs of Vienna; they crossed the ditch, set fire in the suburbs and drove the inhabitants away, and a part of his troops rushed to assist in the ongoing tense battle at the trenches around the inner city. The drawbridge crushed, causing many people falling into the trenches where they drowned, others were killed by Hungarians, who advanced to the gates of the city. The next day the citizens withdrew themselves to the Ungarthore in the cover of the drawbridge in the back suburbs of the outer city. Matthias on the other hand reached the moat in front of the Wienerthore ({{lang-en|Viennese gate}}) and moved his heavy guns forward, including six enormous ones previously captured from the Ottomans and brought siege machines that were made to fill the trenches and called for transport pinnaces to serve as mobile bridges. He ordered the constant shooting of the fortifications.<ref name=\"Fessler\">{{cite book\n  |author = Ignaz Aurelius Fessler\n  |authorlink = Ignaz Aurelius Fessler\n  |title = Geschichte von Ungarn\n  |trans-title=History of Hungary\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/geschichtevonung03fessuoft\n  |accessdate  =3 July 2011\n  |publisher = [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]]\n  |location = [[Leipzig]], Germany\n  |year = 1867\n  |language = German\n  |isbn = \n  |pages = [https://archive.org/details/geschichtevonung03fessuoft/page/158 158]\u2013160\n}}</ref>\nand subsequently destroyed six towers<ref name=\"Bonfini\" /> including the Southwest corner tower.<ref name=\"Reidinger\">{{cite book\n  |author = Erwin Reidinger\n  |title =Planung oder Zufall: Wiener Neustadt 1192\n  |trans-title=Planning or coincidence: Wiener Neustadt 1192\n  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9slQ0vbxvYC\n  |accessdate  =3 July 2011\n  |publisher = B\u00f6hlau Verlag\n  |location = [[Wien]], Austria\n  |year = 2001\n  |language = German\n  |isbn = 963-86118-7-1\n  |page = 212\n}}</ref> So the garrison of Wiener Neustadt lacked tall buildings to install the long-range firearms, they mounted them to the bell towers of the churches. They were still able to bombard the Hungarian main camp. Despite being a devoted Christian Matthias allowed the shelling of the churches except in case of high risk to conflagrate the town with it.<ref name=\"Fessler\" /> Meanwhile, Johann von K\u00f6nigsberg and Ruprecht von Reichenberg successfully broke through the closures and brought in supplies. Reichenberg even torched two of the siege towers on his way leaving.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" /> After seven months lasted with several break-in, dig-in and treachery attempts the city deputies came to the royal camp requesting the cessation of the hostilities. On the third day of negotiations, on 2 July, Johann Wulfersdorf and King Matthias agreed on the following terms:\n[[File:295Innerer Rat Wiener Neustadt.jpg|200px|right|thumb|contemporary picture of the town council of Wiener Neustadt]]\n:The parties wait until 16 August and there should be peace between him and the inhabitants of the castle and town; to this time an imperial army of at least 3000 man must reach the limits of the city gates without the aid of Wiener Neustadt, and thus the siege is automatically lifted, otherwise on the day set the town and castle passes to the King. The commanders and troops as well as the people who want to leave, are free to do so with all of their possessions up to the capacity of 300 wagons but has to leave the Imperial holdings in place. The King confirms the city on its privileges. He also promises to indemnify and return all goods that were taken or devastated. The parties can not approach each other, any transgressor must be gunned down, without breaking this peace.\nRumor was it within the city that an imperial army was coming to their liberation, while Matthias knew what an impossible task it would have been to raise such an army, so the belligerents were both satisfied with the outcome.<ref name=\"Fessler\" />\n\nThe King decided to spend the time between on forcing the nearby Austrian lands to succumb. [[Schottwien]] was the first to handle itself to Hungary after one day of siege on 12 July. Next came [[M\u00fcrzzuschlag]], then [[Kindberg]], Matthias gained full control over the [[Semmering Pass]], altogether 20 municipalities surrendered to him.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony]] intervened by the request of Frederick. He gathered an army on his own cost encompassing 3000 men big enough to fulfill the relief contract. He marched to [[Linz]] where he got support from its archbishop [[Johann von Salzburg]] and captain Gotthard von Starhemberg<ref name=\"Chmel\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/index.php?band=13000000&nr=8110\n| title       = 1487 Juli 19 N\u00fcrnberg \n| author      = Joseph Chmel \n| year        = 1838\n| origyear        = 1487\n| publisher   = Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur\n| work        = Regesta Imperii\n| location    = [[Mainz]], Austria\n| language    = German\n| accessdate  =5 July 2011\n}}</ref> and was ready to go for Vienna Neustadt. He officially declared war on Hungary on 9 August. The two armies met at [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]] where only minor skirmishes occurred but no major confrontation. Matthias wrote a letter in which he declared, that he bears\nwar with Frederick as an [[Archduke of Austria]] and not as the Emperor, after which the Duke on replied 25 August the\nEmperor's hereditary lands belong to the Holy Roman Empire and should not be regarded as casually as something separate from that. While this diplomatic correspondence appointed deadline to lift the siege of Wiener Neustadt had passed. On 17 August 1487 the city was handed over to Matthias peacefully.<ref name=\"Fessler\" /> Thus on 14 October Matthias met with Albert, where a truce was agreed. Albert, no other means than only verbally supported and sometimes insulted by Emperor Frederick came to the decision \u2013 to the discontent of Frederick \u2013 to cease the war against Matthias on 12 December. They chose [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to bring justice to their dissension. Frederick put a veto on the agreement though the parties concerned it done.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the siege a truce was concluded by the Holy See mediator of [[Raimund Peraudi]] between [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] and [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias]] in 1488.<ref name=\"Deutsche Biographie\">{{cite book\n  |title = Raimund(us) Peraudi (P\u00e9raud)\n  |url = http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/xsfz104237.html\n  |accessdate =4 July 2011\n  |publisher = Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek\n  |location = [[M\u00fcnchen]], Germany\n  |language = German\n  |work = Deutsche Biographie\n}}</ref> Frederick agreed in a status quo because he was already busy with the Brugge Revolt in [[Flanders]], in which his son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] was kept hostage by the citizens and his personal presence was needed to solve the situation.<ref name=\"csendes\">{{cite book\n| url         = http://www.napkut.hu/naput_2004/2004_02/051.htm#lj284\n| chapter       = Hunyadi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s nyugati politik\u00e1ja \u00e9s hadj\u00e1ratai\n|trans-chapter=The western policy and campaigns of Matthias Hunedoara\n| first       = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n| last        = Csendes\n| year        = 2004\n| title        = J\u00e1tszm\u00e1k az orsz\u00e1g\u00e9rt\n|trans-title=Matches for the homeland\n| publisher   = Napk\u00fat Kiad\u00f3\n| location    = [[Budapest, Hungary]]\n| language    = Hungarian\n| accessdate  = 6 July 2011\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112150/http://www.napkut.hu/naput_2004/2004_02/051.htm\n| archivedate = 21 July 2011\n| url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"AUT-HUN\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/15cen/brugge14881490.html\n| title       = Flanders : Brugge Revolt, 1488\u20131490\n| author      = Alexander Ganse\n| publisher   = [[Korean Minjok Leadership Academy]]\n| work        = World History at KMLA\n| location    = [[Hoengseong]], South Korea\n| accessdate  =6 July 2011\n}}</ref> In the negotiation Matthias was represented by his Austrian sympathizer counts Christoph von Liechtenstein-Nikolsburg and Leopold Brantz.<ref name=\"csendes\" /> Matthias lifted the custom taxes of vine import for the [[Order of Saint George of Carinthia]].

It was part of the Austro\u2013Hungarian War between [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]]. It marked the end of a series of sieges, whereas Hungary then controlled [[Styria]] and the [[Lower Austria]].\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:311St.Georgs Ritterorden Einsetzung durch Papst Paul II.jpg|left|thumb|170px|on 1 January 1469 in the presence of Emperor Frederick III Pope Paul II accolades Johann Siebenhirter the first Grand Master of the St. George's Knights in the Lateran Basilica]]\nThe city was alerted many times during the Austro-Hungarian War. First in 1477 [[Grand master (order)|Grand master]] [[Johann Siebenhirter]] of the newly founded (1469) [[Order of Saint George of Carinthia]] \"defenders of environment\" occupied the city in order to defend the city. They were order dedicated to defend the borders of Austrian lands from the Eastern menaces. Originally set against the Ottomans the order found itself in between [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias]] of Hungary and the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] the latter who imposed as the founder knight of the order. Siebenhirter placed the headquarters of the Order from [[Millstatt]] to Wiener Neustadt. In May 1478 he commanded the cottars of the [[Peace Treaty of Wiener Neustadt|mortgaged Hungarian villages]] [[Kismarton]] and [[Frakn\u00f3]] \u2013 of which he was the captain of, and in which he had spawned the Ordership \u2013 to drudge-work in the fortification labour of the city. After the [[Siege of Vienna (1485)|siege of Vienna]] he visited Matthias to compromise the status of Neustadt. As a result, they concluded a truce regarding the territories owned by the Order and exchanged their [[prisoners of war]]. The treaty meant the immunization of the Order off the Austro-Hungarian war. This was a contradicting situation as Siebenhirter kept his captain office of Neustadt in the meantime. Siebenhirter also committed himself that his knights at [[Raach am Hochgebirge|Wartenstein]] would refuse any support request from the Emperor. Also he could continue to run the Order in the lands under Matthias' authority.<ref name=\"Dezs\u00e9nyi\" />\n\n==The siege==\n[[File:WrNeustadt Reckturm.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Tower at the northwestern corner of Wiener Neustadt's defensive wall]]\n[[Burg Wiener Neustadt|Wiener Neustadt]] was a well defended and equipped fortress town of its time. The town was surrounded by three ditches and a powerful rectangular chain of ashlar stone walls, the suburbs were protected by a wide waterditch against sudden attacks, with four gates exits on drawbridges to the city. At the Ungarthore ({{lang-en|Hungarian gate}}) stood the ducal castle with high walls and four stone towers. At the back the castle laid the Thiergarten enclosed by a deep moat. The surrounding area was swampy and gritty, which complicated the task of the besiegers. The fortifications were provided with arquebuses and machines with fire range of 2000 steps.\n\nAfter the [[Siege of Vienna (1485)|siege of Vienna]] [[Matthias Corvinus|King Matthias]] urged his troops to encircle Wiener Neustadt, which could pose a possible threat to the conquered lands in later times. He sent captains [[Stephen Z\u00e1polya]], Ladislaus Kanizsay, Jakob Sz\u00e9kely, Wilhelm Tettauer und Stephan B\u00e1thory to begin the siege in 1486. They constructed four siege towers. Upon the prediction of his astrologists he joined them on 13 January 1487 after one year of the siege.<ref name=\"Bonfini\">{{cite book\n |author        = Antonio Bonfini\n |authorlink    = Antonio Bonfini\n |title         = Rerum Hungaricum Decades\n |trans-title   = Ten Volumes of Hungarian Matters\n |publisher     = Balassi Kiad\u00f3 (reprint)\n |location      = [[Budapest]], Hungary\n |url           = http://tortenelmunk.multiply.com/journal?&page_start=120\n |accessdate    = 30 June 2011\n |language      = Hungarian\n |origyear      = 1568\n |chapter       = Negyedik tized \u2013 hatodik-nyolcadik k\u00f6nyv\n |trans-chapter = Fourth decade \u2013 sixth-eighth book\n |year          = 1995\n |isbn          = 963-506-040-8\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104931/http://tortenelmunk.multiply.com/journal?&page_start=120\n |archivedate   = 26 March 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter his arrival Matthias realized the errors made by his captains. He found the ring of siege not tight enough. He pulled the circle closer and several watchtowers were built. He inducted the rotation of the reserves in the siege shifts so he was always able to assault with fresh soldiers. The [[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]] was ordered to attack the suburbs of Vienna; they crossed the ditch, set fire in the suburbs and drove the inhabitants away, and a part of his troops rushed to assist in the ongoing tense battle at the trenches around the inner city. The drawbridge crushed, causing many people falling into the trenches where they drowned, others were killed by Hungarians, who advanced to the gates of the city. The next day the citizens withdrew themselves to the Ungarthore in the cover of the drawbridge in the back suburbs of the outer city. Matthias on the other hand reached the moat in front of the Wienerthore ({{lang-en|Viennese gate}}) and moved his heavy guns forward, including six enormous ones previously captured from the Ottomans and brought siege machines that were made to fill the trenches and called for transport pinnaces to serve as mobile bridges. He ordered the constant shooting of the fortifications.<ref name=\"Fessler\">{{cite book\n  |author = Ignaz Aurelius Fessler\n  |authorlink = Ignaz Aurelius Fessler\n  |title = Geschichte von Ungarn\n  |trans-title=History of Hungary\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/geschichtevonung03fessuoft\n  |accessdate  =3 July 2011\n  |publisher = [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]]\n  |location = [[Leipzig]], Germany\n  |year = 1867\n  |language = German\n  |isbn = \n  |pages = [https://archive.org/details/geschichtevonung03fessuoft/page/158 158]\u2013160\n}}</ref>\nand subsequently destroyed six towers<ref name=\"Bonfini\" /> including the Southwest corner tower.<ref name=\"Reidinger\">{{cite book\n  |author = Erwin Reidinger\n  |title =Planung oder Zufall: Wiener Neustadt 1192\n  |trans-title=Planning or coincidence: Wiener Neustadt 1192\n  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9slQ0vbxvYC\n  |accessdate  =3 July 2011\n  |publisher = B\u00f6hlau Verlag\n  |location = [[Wien]], Austria\n  |year = 2001\n  |language = German\n  |isbn = 963-86118-7-1\n  |page = 212\n}}</ref> So the garrison of Wiener Neustadt lacked tall buildings to install the long-range firearms, they mounted them to the bell towers of the churches. They were still able to bombard the Hungarian main camp. Despite being a devoted Christian Matthias allowed the shelling of the churches except in case of high risk to conflagrate the town with it.<ref name=\"Fessler\" /> Meanwhile, Johann von K\u00f6nigsberg and Ruprecht von Reichenberg successfully broke through the closures and brought in supplies. Reichenberg even torched two of the siege towers on his way leaving.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" /> After seven months lasted with several break-in, dig-in and treachery attempts the city deputies came to the royal camp requesting the cessation of the hostilities. On the third day of negotiations, on 2 July, Johann Wulfersdorf and King Matthias agreed on the following terms:\n[[File:295Innerer Rat Wiener Neustadt.jpg|200px|right|thumb|contemporary picture of the town council of Wiener Neustadt]]\n:The parties wait until 16 August and there should be peace between him and the inhabitants of the castle and town; to this time an imperial army of at least 3000 man must reach the limits of the city gates without the aid of Wiener Neustadt, and thus the siege is automatically lifted, otherwise on the day set the town and castle passes to the King. The commanders and troops as well as the people who want to leave, are free to do so with all of their possessions up to the capacity of 300 wagons but has to leave the Imperial holdings in place. The King confirms the city on its privileges. He also promises to indemnify and return all goods that were taken or devastated. The parties can not approach each other, any transgressor must be gunned down, without breaking this peace.\nRumor was it within the city that an imperial army was coming to their liberation, while Matthias knew what an impossible task it would have been to raise such an army, so the belligerents were both satisfied with the outcome.<ref name=\"Fessler\" />\n\nThe King decided to spend the time between on forcing the nearby Austrian lands to succumb. [[Schottwien]] was the first to handle itself to Hungary after one day of siege on 12 July. Next came [[M\u00fcrzzuschlag]], then [[Kindberg]], Matthias gained full control over the [[Semmering Pass]], altogether 20 municipalities surrendered to him.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Albert III, Duke of Saxony]] intervened by the request of Frederick. He gathered an army on his own cost encompassing 3000 men big enough to fulfill the relief contract. He marched to [[Linz]] where he got support from its archbishop [[Johann von Salzburg]] and captain Gotthard von Starhemberg<ref name=\"Chmel\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://regesten.regesta-imperii.de/index.php?band=13000000&nr=8110\n| title       = 1487 Juli 19 N\u00fcrnberg \n| author      = Joseph Chmel \n| year        = 1838\n| origyear        = 1487\n| publisher   = Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur\n| work        = Regesta Imperii\n| location    = [[Mainz]], Austria\n| language    = German\n| accessdate  =5 July 2011\n}}</ref> and was ready to go for Vienna Neustadt. He officially declared war on Hungary on 9 August. The two armies met at [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]] where only minor skirmishes occurred but no major confrontation. Matthias wrote a letter in which he declared, that he bears\nwar with Frederick as an [[Archduke of Austria]] and not as the Emperor, after which the Duke on replied 25 August the\nEmperor's hereditary lands belong to the Holy Roman Empire and should not be regarded as casually as something separate from that. While this diplomatic correspondence appointed deadline to lift the siege of Wiener Neustadt had passed. On 17 August 1487 the city was handed over to Matthias peacefully.<ref name=\"Fessler\" /> Thus on 14 October Matthias met with Albert, where a truce was agreed. Albert, no other means than only verbally supported and sometimes insulted by Emperor Frederick came to the decision \u2013 to the discontent of Frederick \u2013 to cease the war against Matthias on 12 December. They chose [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to bring justice to their dissension. Frederick put a veto on the agreement though the parties concerned it done.<ref name=\"B\u00e1nlaky\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the siege a truce was concluded by the Holy See mediator of [[Raimund Peraudi]] between [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick]] and [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias]] in 1488.<ref name=\"Deutsche Biographie\">{{cite book\n  |title = Raimund(us) Peraudi (P\u00e9raud)\n  |url = http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/xsfz104237.html\n  |accessdate =4 July 2011\n  |publisher = Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek\n  |location = [[M\u00fcnchen]], Germany\n  |language = German\n  |work = Deutsche Biographie\n}}</ref> Frederick agreed in a status quo because he was already busy with the Brugge Revolt in [[Flanders]], in which his son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] was kept hostage by the citizens and his personal presence was needed to solve the situation.<ref name=\"csendes\">{{cite book\n| url         = http://www.napkut.hu/naput_2004/2004_02/051.htm#lj284\n| chapter       = Hunyadi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s nyugati politik\u00e1ja \u00e9s hadj\u00e1ratai\n|trans-chapter=The western policy and campaigns of Matthias Hunedoara\n| first       = L\u00e1szl\u00f3\n| last        = Csendes\n| year        = 2004\n| title        = J\u00e1tszm\u00e1k az orsz\u00e1g\u00e9rt\n|trans-title=Matches for the homeland\n| publisher   = Napk\u00fat Kiad\u00f3\n| location    = [[Budapest, Hungary]]\n| language    = Hungarian\n| accessdate  = 6 July 2011\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721112150/http://www.napkut.hu/naput_2004/2004_02/051.htm\n| archivedate = 21 July 2011\n| url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"AUT-HUN\">{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/15cen/brugge14881490.html\n| title       = Flanders : Brugge Revolt, 1488\u20131490\n| author      = Alexander Ganse\n| publisher   = [[Korean Minjok Leadership Academy]]\n| work        = World History at KMLA\n| location    = [[Hoengseong]], South Korea\n| accessdate  =6 July 2011\n}}</ref> In the negotiation Matthias was represented by his Austrian sympathizer counts Christoph von Liechtenstein-Nikolsburg and Leopold Brantz.<ref name=\"csendes\" /> Matthias lifted the custom taxes of vine import for the [[Order of Saint George of Carinthia]].

All together there numbered around 3,000 Jews, who were predominantly of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] persuasion.\n\nThe most pious lived in Mattersdorf and Deutschkreutz, where there were important [[yeshiva]]s. Another community developed in Mattersdorf under the leadership of the great Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]] (1763\u20131839). All seven communities fell victim to the persecution of the Jews under the government of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialists]].\n\n== People ==\n* [[Samson Wertheimer]] (1658{{ndash}}1724), chief rabbi of Hungary and Moravia, and rabbi of [[Eisenstadt]]\n* [[Moses Sofer]], rabbi of [[Mattersburg|Mattersdorf]], 1798 - 1806<ref>[http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl_11/197.pdf N.

He is calm and does not panic when confronting the walkers, even when he was trapped at the end of a locked corridor as a herd approached. He appears to have adapted quickly to the new world, telling Nicholas Clark that the only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness. Victor has a good sense of judgement, quickly as weak, yet believing that Nick has the skills to survive, identifying his heroin addiction as a precursor to the behavior necessary for survival. He appears to have some elements of a sociopath.\n\n===Season 1===\n{{see also|Fear the Walking Dead (season 1)}}\nIn a military cell, Strand bribes a guardsman to save a feverish Nick from being moved. Strand later recruits Nick for an escape plot. The group drives to the National Guard's headquarters to rescue Liza, Griselda, and Nick. Travis' group reach the holding cells and set the detainees free before reuniting with Nick, Liza, and Strand. They try to escape through the medical ward, where they discover Dr. Exner has euthanized all of the patients. Dr. Exner tells them of an escape route before presumably committing suicide. Before they can escape, the group encounters Adams, who shoots Ofelia in the arm. Enraged, Travis brutally beats Adams and leaves him for dead. Strand leads the group to his oceanside mansion, where he reveals to Nick that he owns a yacht which he plans to escape on, called the Abigail.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{see also|Fear the Walking Dead (season 2)}}\nThe group evacuates to the Abigail as the military bombs Los Angeles, in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Out at sea, the group comes across another boat full of survivors, but Strand refuses to pick them up. Strand informs the group they are heading to San Diego. Alicia mans the radio, only to hear distress calls, and she strikes up a conversation with another seaborne survivor named Jack. Madison becomes concerned at how Strand refuses to sleep, and Daniel tells her he is suspicious of Strand's motives. Once they are far enough out to sea, the group holds a funeral for Liza and buries her at sea. Strand threatens to throw overboard anyone who disobeys him. The group docks on a nearby island to escape pursuit of the unknown ship. They soon have to leave because George poisoned his entire family as part of a suicide pact, and the group are forced to leave the remainder of George's family behind on the island. With the news that San Diego has been burned down, it is revealed that Strand intended to go to Mexico the entire time. On the way to Mexico the boat's cooling system is clogged up and Strand orders Travis to fix it. They meet a woman named Alex and a boy who is badly burned.

On the way to Mexico the boat's cooling system is clogged up and Strand orders Travis to fix it. They meet a woman named Alex and a boy who is badly burned. They agree to be towed behind the boat, but in the middle of the night Strand cuts the rope.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{see also|Fear the Walking Dead (season 3)}}\n{{Empty section|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|Fear the Walking Dead (season 4)}}\n{{Empty section|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|Fear the Walking Dead (season 5)}}\n{{Empty section|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Development and reception==\nDomingo made his debut in the first-season episode \"[[Cobalt (Fear the Walking Dead)|Cobalt]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/09/fear-the-walking-dead-season-1-episode-5-review-cobalt/|title=Fear the Walking Dead Season 1 Episode 5 Review: Cobalt|date=28 September 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/06/colman-domingo-joins-cast-of-amcs-the-walking-dead-spin-off-summer-series-fear-the-walking-dead-153846/|title=Colman Domingo Joins Cast of AMC\u2019s \u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Spin-off Summer Series, \u2018Fear the Walking Dead\u2019|first=Tambay A.|last=Obenson|date=10 June 2015|publisher=}}</ref> For the [[Fear the Walking Dead (season 2)|second season]], Domingo was promoted to a series regular,<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title='Fear the Walking Dead' Promotes Colman Domingo to Series Regular for Season 2|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fear-walking-dead-promotes-colman-845500|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 3, 2015|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> and would later become a prominent character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/fear-the-walking-dead-season-1-episode-5-review-torture/|title=Fear the Walking Dead Peels Away the Layers of Humanity|website=screenrant.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-walking-dead/258644/fear-the-walking-dead-colman-domingo-talks-whats-next-for-victor-strand|title=Fear the Walking Dead: Colman Domingo Talks What's Next for Victor Strand|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/thewalkingdead/2017/06/02/colman-domingo-strand-fear-the-walking-dead-season-3-/|title=Fear The Walking Dead: Colman Domingo Reveals What Victor Strand Is Up To|publisher=}}</ref> Matt Fowler for [[IGN]] described him as a weird, suited \"[[Randall Flagg]]\" type character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/28/fear-the-walking-dead-cobalt-review|title=Fear the Walking Dead: \"Cobalt\" Review|first=Matt|last=Fowler|date=27 September 2015|website=Ign.com|accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nDomingo's performance was praised in the episode \"[[Blood in the Streets (Fear the Walking Dead)|Blood in the Streets]]\".

It was released as the second [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Like a Prayer'' on May 9, 1989, by [[Sire Records]]. \"Express Yourself\" was the first song that Madonna and producer [[Stephen Bray]] collaborated on for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] song that features instrumentation from [[brass]], handclaps and [[Drum machine|drum beats]], while the chorus is backed by the sound of [[saxophone]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=Like a Prayer - Madonna |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/like-a-prayer-mw0000198738 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref> The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; [[subtext]]s are employed throughout the song. \"Express Yourself\" received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. Commercially, the single peaked at number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became Madonna's sixth number-one hit on the [[European Hot 100 Singles]] chart. It also reached the top of the singles charts in Canada and Switzerland, and the top-five elsewhere.\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] for \"Express Yourself\", directed by [[David Fincher]], was inspired by the 1927 [[Fritz Lang]] classic film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. It had a total budget of $5&nbsp;million&nbsp;(${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1989|r=2}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which made it the most expensive music video made up to then, and currently [[List of most expensive music videos|the third most expensive of all time]]. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them\u2014played by model [[Cameron Alborzian]]\u2014as her date. Critics noted the video's depiction of female sexuality and that Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" has been performed on four of Madonna's [[concert tour]]s and has been covered by the female leads of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', who performed the song in the episode titled \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\". The song and the video are noted for their freedom expression and feminist aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts, including the [[Spice Girls]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=\"The message of the song is that people should always say what it is they want. The reason relationships don't work is because they are afraid. That's been my problem in all my relationships. I'm sure people see me as an outspoken person, and for the most part, if I want something I ask for it. But sometimes you feel that if you ask for too much or ask for the wrong thing from someone you care about that that person won't like you. And so you censor yourself. I've been guilty of that in every meaningful relationship I've ever had.

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think you are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too.\"<ref name=\"mick59\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=59}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename     = ExpressYourselfSample.ogg\n | title        = 'Express Yourself'\n | description  = A 28 second sample of the song, where Madonna sings the first verse, accompanied by a male voice repeating the last line.

'Cause I got something to say about it, And it goes something like this.\"<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]] of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], \"Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down\", a male voice repeating the last line.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words \"Express yourself\" with background vocals singing \"Hey, hey, hey, hey\" alongside her.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nAfter a small saxophone [[break (music)|interlude]], a break-down comes with Madonna singing in a fuller voice, as horns and percussion beats continue. Madonna changes the lyrics at the end to \"express himself\", and after another repetition of the bridge and the intermediate verse, the chorus comes where she changes the lyrics back to the original title. The song ends with the words \"respect yourself\" fading out.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Set within a simple song structure, \"Express Yourself\" plays with ambiguity through a subtle control of [[harmony]] and the avoidance of diatonic closure. The song appears to be in the key of [[G major]] but its actual composition seems to be written in the key of [[C major]]. But the first note of the melody, \"don't\" in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], implies the G Dorian mode.<ref name=\"white\">{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=138}}</ref> This is also evident in Madonna's vocal nuance on the words \"express yourself\", which initially centers on G, before moving down a semitone to [[E minor]], the raised 6th in G Dorian.<ref name=\"white\"/> Per the sheet music published by [[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Co. Inc.]], \"Express Yourself\" is set in [[time signature]] of common time, with a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.

Behind her, smoke is seen billowing.]]\nThe video opens with the view of a city populated with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears on the back of a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: \"Come on girls, do you believe in love?\" This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pours incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.\n\nWith the beginning of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it from the other side of the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to expose her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.\n\nAs the final verse of the song begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a stalking cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it over her shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, \"Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind\".\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n[[File:Michael Jackson (20589951783) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=In the center for the photo, a light skinned male with black hair wearing a gold shirt and black pants, has his right hand to his crotch and his left hand held up high.|Madonna's crotch-grabbing in the music video was compared to that of [[Michael Jackson]].]]\nAuthors Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that \"the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism.\" They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, leading them to say that \"the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism.\"<ref name=\"fouz26\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes the fact that women can be in control because of their sexual prowess.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike ''Metropolis'', where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'', and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that \"Express Yourself\" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gracyk|2001|p=187}}</ref> Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book ''Political Theory for Mortals'', that \"Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=38}}</ref> Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of \"[[Michael Jackson]]'s androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity.\" He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=282}}</ref>\n\nMichelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, authors of ''Femme/Butch'', commended the video for showing a shift in power between the sexes, declaring that \"Madonna assertively claimed all possible gender space like [[Marlene Dietrich]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|Meem|2002|p=155}}</ref> Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, ''Experiencing Music Video'' that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernallis|2004|p=178}}</ref> In the book ''The 1980s'', authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called \"Express Yourself\" as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its \"exploitation\" of the male body and sexualizing them as an object of desire. The authors also added that the video \"was a colorful homage to the term [[gaze]], but Madonna is the bearer of it\u2014not men.\" Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. \"She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song\", Stoddart concluded.<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=120}}</ref> Elizabeth Edwards, one of the authors of ''Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader'', explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by \"watching herself\". She concluded by saying, \"'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons\u2014male and female\u2014and a whole new level of irony.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|Bhaumik|2009|p=266}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of ''On Fashion'', deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=176}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video \"is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics.\"<ref name=\"100g\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_10|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ed|date=June 30, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Culture and Power'', Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Coperi\u00e1s Aguilar pointed out the video for its ''chaotic'' texture through the rapid editing of the multiple shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an \"apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation\", she added.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Since [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] has traditionally been associated with the female [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] principle as opposed to male principle of [[cosmos|order]], the video in turn came to be associated with [[dualistic cosmology|duality]] between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Aguilar also drew parallel between ''Metropolis'' and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work.<ref name=\"aui\"/> However, unlike ''Metropolis'' which portrayed repression of a rebellious [[proletariat]], the chaotic nature of \"Express Yourself\" video showed freedom instead.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Caryn James from ''The New York Times'' added that \"asked about the video, [Madonna] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism\u2014'I was chained to my desires'\u2014to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options.\"<ref name=\"nyt2\"/> Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her \"crotch-grabbing\", saying that \"if male singers like [[Michael Jackson]] can get away with it, why can't women?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=50}}</ref>\n\nTheorist [[Douglas Kellner]] further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end.<ref name=\"kell\"/> According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her \"crotch-hugging\" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position.<ref name=\"kell\"/> As feminist author [[Susan Bordo]] pointed out, \"it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bordo|Heywood|2004|p=272}}</ref> At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]], \"Express Yourself\" was nominated in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], winning the last three categories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_kUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6888,1746370|title=Paula Abdul Tops Music Video Awards|last=Antczak|first=John|date=September 8, 1989|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[The Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=7}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' also honored the video as the Best Music Video of the year, at their Music Video Awards for 1989.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Peniston Leads Nominees For Billboard Music Video Awards|date=October 17, 1992|journal=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|volume=104|issue=42|pages=79}}</ref> The music video of \"Express Yourself\" is ranked at number one on [[Slant Magazine]]'s \"100 Greatest Music Videos\".<ref name=\"100g\"/> It is also placed at number ten on both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s \"The 100 Top Music Videos\" and MTV's \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\", as well as number three on [[MuchMusic]]'s list of \"Top 100 Videos of The Century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> David Dale from ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' listed it as one of the Most Influential Videos of All Time, at number 18.<ref name=\"smh2\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine listed it at number eight on their countdown of The 30-All Time Best Music Videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085392_2085369,00.html|title=The 30 All-Time Best Music Videos|last=Levy|first=Glen|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:ExpressYourselfUnderGround cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=The image of a young blond woman.

This reaction was channeled mainly by the media's strong attacks against feminism, generally describing activists as \"tortured people with hairy legs\", \"radical, bitter, man-hating, separatist and lesbian\", accompanied by messages advocating a feminization of women that turned them into beautiful ornamental objects, and tended to increase the cultural differences between the sexes.<ref name=\"aui\"/> \"Express Yourself\" appeared as a refutation of some of these reactionary premises. The title, Aguilar noted, seemed to raise the question of the urgency of a feminine voice to develop and emerge\u2014a concern that recalled the tradition of French feminists like [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous]] and [[Luce Irigaray]].<ref name=\"aui\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MelanieChisholm.jpg\n| width1 = 117\n| alt1 = A brunette woman singing, wearing a sleeveless jacket\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Christina Aguilera Sanremo.jpg\n| width2 = 117\n| alt2 = A blond woman singing, wearing a black gown\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Lady Gaga EuroPride 2011.jpg\n| width3 = 150\n| alt3 = A woman wearing a blue bob wig, stands talking behind a podium.

It was released as the second single from the album on May 9, 1989 by [[Sire Records]]. The song was included on the greatest hits compilation albums ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990), and ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). \"Express Yourself\" was the first song that Madonna and producer [[Stephen Bray]] collaborated on for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] and [[deep funk]] song that features instrumentation from [[brass]], handclaps and [[drum machine|drum beats]], while the chorus is backed by the sound of saxophone and percussion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=Like a Prayer - Madonna |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/like-a-prayer-mw0000198738 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref> The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; [[subtext]]s are employed throughout the song. \"Express Yourself\" received positive reviews from critics, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. Commercially, the song peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became Madonna's sixth number-one hit on the [[European Hot 100 Singles]] chart. It also reached the top of the singles charts in Canada and Switzerland, and the top five elsewhere.\n\nThe accompanying music video, directed by [[David Fincher]], was inspired by the [[Fritz Lang]] classic film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). It had a total budget of $5&nbsp;million&nbsp;(${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1989|r=2}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which made it the most expensive music video made up to then, and currently [[List of most expensive music videos|the third most expensive of all time]]. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them\u2014played by model [[Cameron Alborzian]]\u2014as her date. Critics noted the video's depiction of female sexuality and that Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" has been performed on four of Madonna's world tours, and has been covered by the female leads of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', who performed the song in the episode titled \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\". The song and the video are noted for their freedom expression and feminist aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts, including the [[Spice Girls]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=\"The message of the song is that people should always say what it is they want. The reason relationships don't work is because they are afraid. That's been my problem in all my relationships. I'm sure people see me as an outspoken person, and for the most part, if I want something I ask for it. But sometimes you feel that if you ask for too much or ask for the wrong thing from someone you care about that that person won't like you. And so you censor yourself. I've been guilty of that in every meaningful relationship I've ever had.

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think you are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too.\"<ref name=\"mick59\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=59}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename     = ExpressYourselfSample.ogg\n | title        = 'Express Yourself'\n | description  = A 28 second sample of the song, where Madonna sings the first verse, accompanied by a male voice repeating the last line.

'Cause I got something to say about it, And it goes something like this.\"<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]] of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], \"Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down\", a male voice repeating the last line.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words \"Express yourself\" with background vocals singing \"Hey, hey, hey, hey\" alongside her.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nAfter a small saxophone [[break (music)|interlude]], a break-down comes with Madonna singing in a fuller voice, as horns and percussion beats continue. Madonna changes the lyrics at the end to \"express himself\", and after another repetition of the bridge and the intermediate verse, the chorus comes where she changes the lyrics back to the original title. The song ends with the words \"respect yourself\" fading out.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Set within a simple song structure, \"Express Yourself\" plays with ambiguity through a subtle control of [[harmony]] and the avoidance of diatonic closure. The song appears to be in the key of [[G major]] but its actual composition seems to be written in the key of [[C major]]. But the first note of the melody, \"don't\" in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], implies the G Dorian mode.<ref name=\"white\">{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=138}}</ref> This is also evident in Madonna's vocal nuance on the words \"express yourself\", which initially centers on G, before moving down a semitone to [[E minor]], the raised 6th in G Dorian.<ref name=\"white\"/> Per the sheet music published by [[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Co. Inc.]], \"Express Yourself\" is set in [[time signature]] of common time, with a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.

They added that the opening line \"Don't go for second best, baby\" transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=223}}</ref> Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted in her book ''Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity'', that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of \"Express Yourself\" did not appear surprising.<ref name=\"white\"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blond Ambition'' declared that \"the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=194}}</ref> O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review:\n<blockquote>\n\"Express Yourself\" is a feminist call-to-arms, complete with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having a man who loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God and the power of orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\" and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.<ref name=\"lucy\"/>\n</blockquote>\nProfessor [[Maury Dean]] wrote in his book ''Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia'', that the main appeal of \"Express Yourself\" lay in its teen appeal, although he understood that at its core, it was addressing a very important issue of female liberation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=525}}</ref> Kevin Phinney from ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' commented that with \"Express Yourself\", Madonna struck out her \"Material Girl\" persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|last=Whiney|first=Kevin|date=March 22, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD895970EA30B8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title='Like A Prayer' gives Madonna a vehicle for confession}}</ref> Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from ''Like a Prayer''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-05-18/entertainment/26110319_1_underwear-music-video-madonna|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|title=Madonna Writhes Again Rock's Siren Flounces Her New Lingerie In 'Express Yourself' Video For Mtv|date=May 18, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|last=Takey|first=Jonathan}}</ref> Andy Goldberg from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/99163067.html?dids=99163067:99163067&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+07%2C+1989&author=Andy+Goldberg&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=MADONNA+SAYS+IT+ALL&pqatl=google|title=Madonna Says It All|date=April 7, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|last=Goldberg|first=Andy|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[J.

Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In ''Madonna 'Talking': Madonna in Her Own Words'', she commented about the development of the video.\n<blockquote>\nThis one I had the most amount of input. I oversaw everything\u2014the building of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody.

I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men\u2014the workers, diligently, methodically working away.<ref name=\"mick\"/>\n</blockquote>\nMadonna mentioned jokingly in a 1990 [[BBC Television]] interview on the program ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that \"Pussy rules the world\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|BBC Omnibus: Madonna \u2013 Behind the American Dream]]|airdate=August 10, 1990|credits=Presenter:|time=19:29|network=[[BBC Television]]|location=London|transcript=broadcast|season=24|seriesno=|quote=The video means, 'Pussy rules the world!|series=Omnibus|serieslink=Omnibus (UK TV series)}}</ref> She added that the idea of the cat licking the milk and then pour it over, was the director's. \"It's great but believe me I fought him on that.

Behind her, smoke is seen billowing.]]\nThe video opens with the view of a city populated with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears on the back of a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: \"Come on girls, do you believe in love?\" This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pours incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.\n\nWith the beginning of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it from the other side of the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to expose her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.\n\nAs the final verse of the song begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a stalking cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it over her shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, \"Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind\".\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n[[File:Michael Jackson (20589951783) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=In the center for the photo, a light skinned male with black hair wearing a gold shirt and black pants, has his right hand to his crotch and his left hand held up high.|Madonna's crotch-grabbing in the music video was compared to that of [[Michael Jackson]].]]\nAuthors Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that \"the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism.\" They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, leading them to say that \"the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism.\"<ref name=\"fouz26\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes the fact that women can be in control because of their sexual prowess.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike ''Metropolis'', where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'', and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that \"Express Yourself\" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gracyk|2001|p=187}}</ref> Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book ''Political Theory for Mortals'', that \"Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=38}}</ref> Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of \"[[Michael Jackson]]'s androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity.\" He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=282}}</ref>\n\nMichelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, authors of ''Femme/Butch'', commended the video for showing a shift in power between the sexes, declaring that \"Madonna assertively claimed all possible gender space like [[Marlene Dietrich]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|Meem|2002|p=155}}</ref> Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, ''Experiencing Music Video'' that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernallis|2004|p=178}}</ref> In the book ''The 1980s'', authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called \"Express Yourself\" as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its \"exploitation\" of the male body and sexualizing them as an object of desire. The authors also added that the video \"was a colorful homage to the term [[gaze]], but Madonna is the bearer of it\u2014not men.\" Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. \"She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song\", Stoddart concluded.<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=120}}</ref> Elizabeth Edwards, one of the authors of ''Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader'', explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by \"watching herself\". She concluded by saying, \"'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons\u2014male and female\u2014and a whole new level of irony.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|Bhaumik|2009|p=266}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of ''On Fashion'', deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=176}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video \"is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics.\"<ref name=\"100g\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_10|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ed|date=June 30, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Culture and Power'', Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Coperi\u00e1s Aguilar pointed out the video for its ''chaotic'' texture through the rapid editing of the multiple shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an \"apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation\", she added.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Since [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] has traditionally been associated with the female [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] principle as opposed to male principle of [[cosmos|order]], the video in turn came to be associated with [[dualistic cosmology|duality]] between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Aguilar also drew parallel between ''Metropolis'' and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work.<ref name=\"aui\"/> However, unlike ''Metropolis'' which portrayed repression of a rebellious [[proletariat]], the chaotic nature of \"Express Yourself\" video showed freedom instead.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Caryn James from ''The New York Times'' added that \"asked about the video, [Madonna] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.'
