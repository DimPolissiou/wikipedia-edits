First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

Archaeological evidence of Aboriginal camp sites have been found on the upper terraces of the Macleay and Apsley rivers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[John Oxley]], failed to realize the potential of this river in 1820 when he did not navigate far enough up the river to see the magnificent stands of timber and the fertile land. The river was vaguely referred to as the New River from descriptions given by Aborigines. In 1826 Captain Wright travelled overland from Port Macquarie and explored to the head of navigation at Belgrave Falls, a series of rapids to the west of the present town of Kempsey. Then called Wrights River, Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], Commandant of Port Macquarie Penal Settlement, sent the first government gang of Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]'') cutters to work here in 1827.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMore cedar camps were established on the Macleay during the 1830s and the area was also a haven for escaped convicts. By 1841, about 200 cutters were working on the river area, where violence and theft of logs was not uncommon. Demand and prices dropped in 1842 and cutting along the Macleay diminished although it continued in the upper tributaries. When Europeans arrived in the area around the 1820s the river mouth was just south of Grassy Head, and almost a mile wide with a sand spit in the middle.  The small town of Stuarts Point was established on the river just inside to serve arriving ships.<ref>{{cite book |title=Valley of the Macleay |author=Neil, Marie H |year=1972 |isbn=0-85587-037-0 |chapter=Chapters 1 and 10}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal strip extending from South West Rocks to Grassy Head is a wide delta with various channels connected to the river.  Around 1885 English marine engineer John Coode advised on improvements to various rivers and ports in Australia, including the Macleay.  The Department of Public Works prepared four plans for improvements to the mouth, Coode favoured improving the existing entrance.  In 1893 a flood enlarged an opening near South West Rocks and the department elected to improve that, called the New Entrance, though Coode had thought it not enough to drain all the waters of the district. Work on the new entrance commenced in April 1896, improving the channel and adding training walls.

Archaeological evidence of Aboriginal camp sites have been found on the upper terraces of the Macleay and Apsley rivers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[John Oxley]], failed to realize the potential of this river in 1820 when he did not navigate far enough up the river to see the magnificent stands of timber and the fertile land. The river was vaguely referred to as the New River from descriptions given by Aborigines. In 1826 Captain Wright travelled overland from Port Macquarie and explored to the head of navigation at Belgrave Falls, a series of rapids to the west of the present town of Kempsey. Then called Wrights River, Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], Commandant of Port Macquarie Penal Settlement, sent the first government gang of Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]'') cutters to work here in 1827.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMore cedar camps were established on the Macleay during the 1830s and the area was also a haven for escaped convicts. By 1841, about 200 cutters were working on the river area, where violence and theft of logs was not uncommon. Demand and prices dropped in 1842 and cutting along the Macleay diminished although it continued in the upper tributaries. When Europeans arrived in the area around the 1820s the river mouth was just south of Grassy Head, and almost a mile wide with a sand spit in the middle.  The small town of Stuarts Point was established on the river just inside to serve arriving ships.<ref>{{cite book |title=Valley of the Macleay |author=Neil, Marie H |year=1972 |isbn=0-85587-037-0 |chapter=Chapters 1 and 10}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal strip extending from South West Rocks to Grassy Head is a wide delta with various channels connected to the river.  Around 1885 English marine engineer John Coode advised on improvements to various rivers and ports in Australia, including the Macleay.  The Department of Public Works prepared four plans for improvements to the mouth, Coode favoured improving the existing entrance.  In 1893 a flood enlarged an opening near South West Rocks and the department elected to improve that, called the New Entrance, though Coode had thought it not enough to drain all the waters of the district. Work on the new entrance commenced in April 1896, improving the channel and adding training walls. A new [[pilot station]] was built in 1902, establishing the town of [[South West Rocks, New South Wales|South West Rocks]]. Work was completed in 1906.  Today the old mouth has silted up, leaving Stuarts Point on a dead-end reach.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nVariously known as Wright River, Trail River, New and McLeay rivers it was named the Macleay River in honour of Innes\u2019s father-in-law, [[Alexander Macleay]], Scottish-born scientist and colonial secretary of New South Wales.<ref name=gnb/><ref>{{cite book |author=Kay, Donald, J |title=Exploring the North Coast and New England |publisher=Kangaroo Press |location=Kenthurst |year=1978 |isbn=0-86417-121-8}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|New South Wales}}\n* [[Rivers of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of rivers of Australia]]\n* [[Macleay River Bridge]] - the longest [[road bridge]] in Australia.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/ieo/Macleay/maplg.htm|title=Macleay River catchment|format=map|work=Office of Environment and Heritage|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=}}\n* [http://nrgeology.blogspot.com.au/search/label/macleay_river Northern Rivers Geology Blog - Macleay River]\n\n{{Rivers of the Northern Rivers catchment |state=autocollapse}} \n{{Rivers of New South Wales |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Mid North Coast NSW |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Towns in New England |state=autocollapse}}\n{{coord|30|52|S|153|01|E|display=title|region:AU-NSW_type:river_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n[[Category:Rivers of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New England (New South Wales)]]\n[[Category:Northern Tablelands]]\n[[Category:Mid North Coast]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:+commons category; move coords inline", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macleay_River"}
