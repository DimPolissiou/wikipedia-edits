In most cases, the association, especially when formalised by local government, is known as \"[[town twinning]]\" (though other terms, such as \"partner towns\" or \"sister cities\" are sometimes used instead), and while most of the places included are towns, the list also comprises villages, cities, districts, counties, etc. with similar links.\n\n{{compact ToC| side=yes | name=Index | nobreak=yes

The shrub usually has a single stem at ground level, but it may branch on the lower stem. The stem bark is gray and nearly smooth with raised lenticels. The inner bark has a green layer over an ivory color (Little and others 1974). The plants examined by the author, growing on firm soil, had weak taproots and well-developed laterals. The roots are white. Foliage is confined to the growing twigs.\n\nThe twigs are gray-green and covered with star-shaped hairs. The spines are short and slightly curved and vary from thick throughout the plant, including the leaf midrib, to entirely absent. The leaves are opposite or one per node, broadly ovate with the border entire or deeply lobed. The petioles are 1 to 6&nbsp;cm long and the blades are 7 to 23 by 5 to 18&nbsp;cm and covered with short hairs. The flowers are white, tubular with 5 pointed lobes, and grouped in corymbiform cymes. They are shed soon after opening.\n\nThe fruits are berries that grow in clusters of tiny green spheres (ca. 1&nbsp;cm in diameter) that look like green peas. They become yellow when fully ripe. They are thin-fleshed and contain numerous flat, round, brown seeds (Howard 1989, Liogier 1995, Little and others 1974).\n[[Image:Turkeyberry.jpg|thumb|right|dried turkey berry]]\n\n==Range==\nTurkey berry apparently is native from Florida and southern Alabama through the West Indies and from Mexico through Central America and South America through Brazil (Little and others 1974). Because of its rapid spread as a weed in disturbed lands, it is difficult to tell which populations are native and which are introduced. Turkey berry has been introduced and naturalized\nthroughout tropical Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands including Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001).\nIn Jamaica this berry is called susumba, or gully beans, and is usually cooked in a dish along with saltfish and [[ackee]]. It is believed to be full of [[iron]] (it does have a strong iron like taste when eaten) and is consumed when one is low in iron.\n\n==Ecology==\nIn Puerto Rico, turkey berry grows in upland sites that receive from about 1000 to 4000&nbsp;mm of annual precipitation. It also grows in riparian zones in drier areas. Turkey berry grows on all types of moist, fertile soil at elevations from near sea level to almost 1,000 m in Puerto Rico (Little and others 1974) and 2,000 m in Papua New Guinea (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001). Given an equal start after disturbance, turkey berry quickly overtops most herbs, grasses, and other shrubs. It grows best in full sunlight and does well in light shade or shade for part of the day, but cannot survive under a closed forest canopy. Turkey berry single plants, groups, and thickets are most frequently seen on roadsides, vacant lots, brushy pastures, recently abandoned\nfarmland, landslides, and river banks.\n\nIt is considered invasive in [[New Caledonia]], where it was likely introduced in 1900.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/divers12-08/010052239.pdf|title=Les esp\u00e8ces exotiques envahissantes de Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie|last=Hequet|first=Vanessa|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=17, 46|language=French}}</ref>\n[[File:Solanum torvum fruit and flower.jpg|thumb|Solanum torvum is a bushy, erect and spiny perennial plant The plant is usually 2 or 3 m in height and 2 cm in basal diameter, but may reach 5m in height and 8 cm in basal diameter. The shrub usually has a single stem at ground level, but it may branch on the lower stem. The stem bark is gray and nearly smooth with raised lenticels.]]\n\n==Reproduction==\nFlowering and fruiting is continuous after the shrubs reach about 1 to 1.5 m in height. Ripe fruits collected in Puerto Rico averaged 1.308 + 0.052 g. Air dry seeds from these fruits weighed an average of 0.00935 g or 1,070,000 seeds/kg. These seeds were sown on commercial potting mix and 60 percent germinated between 13 and 106 days following sowing. The seedlings are common in recently disturbed ground. Frugivorous birds eat the fruits and spread the seeds (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001). Turkey berry can be propagated vegetatively by placing branch cuttings, with or without leaves, in a mist chamber for one month (Badola and others 1993).\n\n==Growth and management==\nTurkey berry grows about 0.75 to 1.5 m in height per year. The species is not long-lived; most plants live about 2 years. Physical control of the shrub may be done by grubbing out the plants; lopping will not kill them.\nThey can be killed by translocated herbicides applied to the leaves or the cut stumps (Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk 2001).\n\n==Cuisine==\n[[File:Pla duk phat phet.jpg|thumb|''Pla duk phat phet'' is a fried Thai catfish curry, here containing ''solanum torvum'']]\nThe green fresh fruits are edible and used in [[Thai cuisine]], as an ingredient in certain [[Thai curry|Thai curries]] or raw in certain Thai chili pastes (''[[nam phrik]]'').<ref>[http://www.thaitable.com/Thai/Ingredients/pea_eggplant.htm Pea eggplant]</ref><ref>http://simplethaifood.com/thai-recipes/dips-sauce/shrimp-chili-paste-nam-prik-ga-pi/</ref> They are also used in Lao cuisine (Royal Horticultural Society 2001) and [[Jamaican cuisine]].<ref>http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120517/cook/cook5.html</ref> The fruits are incorporated into soups and sauces in the [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (Herzog and Gautier-B\u00e9guin 2001).\n\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]], India, the fruit is consumed directly, or as cooked food like Sundaikkai Sambar, Sundaikkai Poriyal, Sundaikkai Aviyal & Sundaikkai Pulikulambu.

India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of [[Public-sector undertaking|public sector enterprises]] that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named ''Indian Institutes of Management''. Calcutta and [[Ahmedabad]] were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006173642/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961,<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news| title = Q&A: Shekhar Chaudhury, Director, IIM Calcutta| author = Swati Garg| url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/qa-shekhar-chaudhury-director-iim-calcutta/435269/ |newspaper=[[Business Standard]] |location=Calcutta |date=12 May 2011}}</ref> and was named ''[[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]'' or ''IIM Calcutta''.

The committee noted that the three IIMs were producing around 400 PGP graduates every year and that they had reached their optimum capacity. It proposed the opening of two more IIMs to meet the rising demand for management professionals. It also recommended expanding the Fellowship programmes, similar to PhD programmes, to meet the growing demand for faculty in management schools in India. The fourth IIM, [[IIM Lucknow]], was established in 1984 based on the committee's recommendation.\n\nTwo more IIMs, the fifth and sixth, were established at [[IIM Kozhikode|Kozhikode]] and [[IIM Indore|Indore]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iimk.ac.in/abtiimk/bog.php |title=Board of Governors |website=iimk.ac.in |accessdate=6 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828044411/http://iimk.ac.in/abtiimk/bog.php |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimidr.ac.in/iimi/pages/institute/about-iimi.php |title=Indian Institute of Management Indore \u2013 About IIMI |website=iimidr.ac.in |accessdate=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915052521/http://www.iimidr.ac.in/iimi/pages/institute/about-iimi.php |archivedate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[IIM Shillong]] was the seventh IIM to be established, following a 2005 decision by the Government of India;<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/25/stories/2005102506591200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Seventh IIM to be set up in Shillong | date=25 October 2005}}</ref> its foundation stone was laid on 1 December 2007;<ref>{{cite news|title=CAG rap on VIP helipad|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100322/jsp/northeast/story_12244613.jsp|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=22 March 2010|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> and its first academic session was 2008\u201309.<ref name=\"NIC-1\" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iimshillong.in/iim-shillong/iim-campus.asp |title=IIM Shillong Campus |website=iimshillong.in |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Since 2007, fourteen new IIMs have been set up, bringing the total number of IIMs to 20, IIM-Jammu being the latest one, starting in 2016.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe Union Cabinet, on 24 January 2017, approved the bill that became the [[Indian Institutes of Management Act, 2017]], which declares IIMs as [[List of Institutes of National Importance|Institutes of National Importance]] and enables them to grant degrees and to further make other important changes to the institute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/24/cabinet-passes-iim-bill-2017-students-to-get-degrees-instead-of/|title=Cabinet Passes IIM Bill 2017, Students To Get Degrees Instead Of Diplomas|website=Huffington Post India|access-date=2017-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202045556/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/24/cabinet-passes-iim-bill-2017-students-to-get-degrees-instead-of/|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The IIM bill was passed by the [[Lok Sabha]] on 28 July 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-live-updates-monsoon-session-july-28-2017/article19376604.ece|title=IIM Bill Passed|last=|first=|date=|website=The Hindu|access-date=}}</ref> and by the [[Rajya Sabha]] on 19 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Final and real autonomy for IIMs is here|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/final-and-real-autonomy-for-iims-is-here/story-wA5AZDuzj2nIA6nxID3ojJ.html|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=25 December 2017|language=en}}</ref> After receiving presidential assent, the IIM bill became an Act on 31 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=IIMs can now award degrees instead of diplomas|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iims-can-now-award-degrees-instead-of-diplomas-new-law/articleshow/62324997.cms|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=1 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iims-can-now-award-degrees-instead-of-diplomas-new-law/articleshow/62324997.cms|title=IIMs can now award degrees instead of diplomas|date=2018|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\nThe IIMs mainly offer postgraduate, doctoral, and executive education programmes.

The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialisation, and typically includes courses in accounting, behavioural science, finance, economics, human-resource management (HRM), management sciences and information technology, marketing, business operations, business mathematics, public policy, statistics and decision analysis, strategy, and general management.\n\nSince 2006, some IIMs have started offering one-year, full-time post graduate diploma programmes for professionals having approximately 5 years or more of work experience. This program was necessitated because the normal 2-year program is primarily aimed at new graduates or graduates with less than 4\u20135 years of work experience. These 1 years programmes are general, fully integrated management programmes with no specialization, and typically include the same courses as offered in a typical 2-year MBA program. These intensive programmes typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of classroom teaching along with projects and other coursework as in a normal, global 2-year MBA program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/rigour-of-a-global-2-year-mba-in-one-year-113011600095_1.html|website=Business Standard|title=Rigour of a global 2-year MBA in one year|date=January 16, 2013|author=Shikhar Mohan }}</ref>\n\nDesigned as a regular MBA programme, which focuses on using the prior work experience of the students, the one-year MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It is called the Post Graduate Program for Executives at IIM Calcutta and IIM Shillong (PGPEX for short), and at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Udaipur (PGPX for short). It is called the Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) at IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and the International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) at IIM Lucknow. The exact structure, admission criteria, and other details of these programmes vary. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with approximately 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays, and personal interviews as entry criteria, similar to other globally reputed MBA programmes. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Bangalore is usually around 710.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information |title=Admission Information |accessdate= 18 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther than these general variants, many IIMs offer specialty programmes built which focus on different areas, e.g. Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) at IIM Lucknow,<ref name=\"iiml.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/programme/post-graduate-programmes/pgp-sm|title=PGP-SM - IIM Lucknow|publisher=}}</ref> Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management (PGDHRM) at IIM Ranchi<ref name=\"iimranchi.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iimranchi.ac.in/?page_id=1014|title=PGDHRM - IIM Ranchi|publisher=}}</ref> and many more.<!-- Adding all specialty programmes is impossible.

The program is called IPM (Integrated Programme in Management) at both the institutes. The course structures are similar though not same at both the institutes. For the first three years, they are taught a combination of \"statistics, economics and humanities\", making them unique in their way. The last two years, they undergo the program with PGP students at their respective institutes. IIM Indore first started this program in 2011 and thereby became the first IIM to have a bachelors program. Four batches of IIM Indore's IPM have been graduated and inducted in the industry. IIM Rohtak has launched this program in 2019 and the first batch is expected to graduate in 2024. IIM Indore offers Bachelor of Arts (Foundations of Management) and MBA (dual-degree) to the graduates of this program. IIM Rohtak has decided to offer Masters of Management Studies (MMS) to five-year graduates and Bachelors of Management Studies (BMS) to students who opt-out after three years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Doctoral education ===\nIIMs offer a Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) as a full-time doctoral-level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of investigative and analytical ability. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of ''Fellow'' of that institute (e.g. ''Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta''). This Fellow Programme is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in specific research areas of their choice.\n\n=== Executive education ===\nMany IIMs offer executive education-certificate programmes targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as  ''Management Development Programme'' (MDP), ''Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises'' (AMPM), and ''Executive General Management Programme'' (EGMP). The certificate programmes at IIMs are not considered as equivalent to an MBA or EMBA. Only the diploma-level programmes are considered as equivalent, depending on whether it is full-time or part-time. Many IIMs\u2014such as IIMC, IIMB, IIMK, IIM Kashipur, and IIM Rohtak\u2014have partnered with third-party companies to enable these courses to be provided under a distributed model.\n\n=== Other programmes ===\nSome IIMs offer specialised programmes targeted at various management segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full-time programme called the ''Armed Forces Programme'' (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full-time programmes in [[public management]] and are called the ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy'' (PGP-PMP) and ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management'' (PGPPM), respectively. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, part-time programme called the ''Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management'' (PGPSEM),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/node/2021/|title=Distinctive Features of PGSEM - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore|publisher=}}</ref> an executive general-management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information-technology industry.

Admission for residents of India to the flagship two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT). CAT scores are often used as the primary short-listing criteria for admissions. International/overseas applicants have the option to apply using [[Graduate Management Admission Test|GMAT]] scores in lieu of CAT scores.<ref name=\"IIMA Website\">{{cite web|title=How to apply|url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgp/how-to-apply/admission-procedure.html|website=IIM Ahmedabad|accessdate=22 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106125206/http://iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgp/how-to-apply/admission-procedure.html|archivedate=6 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> GMAT scores are a prerequisite short-listing criteria used for admission to the one-year full-time programme for experienced executives.<ref name=\"IIMA PGPX Website\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility|url=http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/eligibility-criteria.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105141856/http://www.iimahd.ernet.in/programmes/pgpx/how-to-apply/eligibility-criteria.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 January 2011|website=IIM Ahmedabad|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"IIML IPMX Website\">{{cite web|title=Eligibility|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/post_graduate_program_ipmx_eligibility.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717121219/http://www.iiml.ac.in/post_graduate_program_ipmx_eligibility.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 July 2010|website=IIM Lucknow|accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Test requirements for doctoral programmes vary. Some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a Research Aptitude Test (RAT) followed by round of interviews while all are compelled to accept scores on standardised tests such as the [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]], [[GMAT]], and [[GRE]]. The overall profiles of candidates, including past academic and professional accomplishments, are considered for all programmes, along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an [[interview]], before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.\n\n=== Entrance exam ===\nThe [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes.

As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of [[Scheduled Castes]], and 7.5% for [[Scheduled Tribes]]. Since 2008, the [[Other Backward Classes]] have also been given 27% reservation, after the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld the validity of relevant government regulation. The provisions are being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to take the [[Common Admission Test]] which consists of an objective-type exam, a group-discussion round, and personal interviews, with the cut-off for reserved-category candidates being possibly lower than for general-category candidates. Once admitted to a programme, a reserved category student has to meet all the criteria for completing the programme as a general-category student. Regular counselling sessions, extra classes, and tutorials, by senior students, for needy students are a regular feature of the IIMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbauniverse.com/article.php?id=3613|title=IIM student & alumnus to answer queries on Live Expert Chat|publisher=mbauniverse.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923161108/http://www.mbauniverse.com/article.php?id=3613|archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=IIM USA|url=http://www.iimusa.org/|website=iimusa.org|accessdate=17 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225175553/http://www.iimusa.org/|archivedate=25 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> IIMs provide financial support to needy and deserving students in the form of scholarships.<ref>{{cite web|title=IIM Society|url=https://sites.google.com/a/iim-alumni.org/www/home|website=iim-alumni.org|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Course Fees ==\nIn 2004, IIMs charged a fee of approximately {{INRConvert|1.50|l}} per year ({{INRConvert|3|l}} for two years) for their flagship programmes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/12-per-cent-hike-in-iima-fees/article3141889.ece|title=12 per cent hike in IIM-A fees|date=2006-04-03|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/bline/2004/02/06/stories/2004020602320100.htm|title=The Hindu Business Line : Govt slashes IIM course fees to Rs 30,000|last=ndgks|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/jul/13bspec1.htm|title=What will the fees at IIMs now be?|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/2004/01/02/stories/2004010210901200.htm|title=The Hindu : HRD Ministry to rationalise IIMs' fees|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref> By 2016, the fee was almost {{INRConvert|19|l}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Puranik |first=Apoorva |title=IIM Bangalore hikes fees, gets the tag of costliest IIM |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/iim-bangalore-hikes-fees-gets-the-tag-of-costliest-iim/story-EFD0SofFFz78NKKCC9vLCL.html |date=9 January 2015 |newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=IIM-C raises course fee by Rs 2.7 lakhs |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/iim-c-fee/1/634515.html |date=4 April 2016 |magazine=[[India Today]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=IIM-Ahmedabad Hikes Post-Graduate Course Fee By Rs.1 Lakh |url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/iim-ahmedabad-hikes-post-graduate-course-fee-by-rs-1-lakh-1290190 |date=24 March 2016 |website=[[NDTV]] |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=IIM-A raises fees by Rs 1 lakh for PGPM course |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/education/iim-a-raises-fees-by-rs-1-lakh-for-pgpm-course/ |date=23 March 2016 |newspaper=The Indian Express |accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref> Inflation in India<ref>{{cite web |title=Inflation, consumer prices (annual %) \u2013 India |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=IN |website=The World Bank |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Historic inflation India - CPI inflation |url=http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/india/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-india.aspx |website=inflation.eu |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> has been cited as one of the reasons for the fee hikes at IIMs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Basu |first1=Sreeradha D |last2=Shinde |first2=Ranjit Shinde |title=Fees in top B-schools to rise by Rs 46K-3.2 lakh, depending on the institute |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-04-09/news/72186338_1_19-lakh-management-development-institute-indian-institute |date=9 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919081715/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-04-09/news/72186338_1_19-lakh-management-development-institute-indian-institute |archive-date=19 September 2016 |newspaper=[[The Economic Times]] |access-date=10 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Inflation forces IIM to hike fees  |url=http://digitallearning.eletsonline.com/2014/11/inflation-forces-iim-to-hike-fees/ |date=20 November 2014  |website=Digital Learning |access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Post-graduate program fees ====\nThe IIM post graduation program fees structure varies from {{INRConvert|9|l}}\u2014at IIM Amritsar, a more recent institute\u2014to {{INRConvert|23|l}}\u2014at IIM Ahmedabad.

India grew rapidly in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of [[Public-sector undertaking|public sector enterprises]] that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to help in setting up an All India Institute of Management Studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named ''Indian Institutes of Management''. Calcutta and [[Ahmedabad]] were chosen as the locations for the two new institutes.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006173642/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe institute at Calcutta was established first, on 13 November 1961,<ref name=\"Director\">{{cite news| title = Q&A: Shekhar Chaudhury, Director, IIM Calcutta| author = Swati Garg| url= http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/qa-shekhar-chaudhury-director-iim-calcutta/435269/ |newspaper=[[Business Standard]] |location=Calcutta |date=12 May 2011}}</ref> and was named ''[[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]'' or ''IIM Calcutta''.

The first year coursework generally consists of core courses in various management disciplines, while in the second year students are allowed to select courses from an exhaustive list of electives. The PGP is a general, fully integrated management programme with no specialisation, and typically includes courses in accounting, behavioural science, finance, economics, human-resource management (HRM), management sciences and information technology, marketing, business operations, business mathematics, public policy, statistics and decision analysis, strategy, and general management.\n\nSince 2006, some IIMs have started offering one-year, full-time post graduate diploma programmes for professionals having approximately 5 years or more of work experience. This program was necessitated because the normal 2-year program is primarily aimed at new graduates or graduates with less than 4\u20135 years of work experience. These 1 years programmes are general, fully integrated management programmes with no specialization, and typically include the same courses as offered in a typical 2-year MBA program. These intensive programmes typically require 75 credits or around 750 hours of classroom teaching along with projects and other coursework as in a normal, global 2-year MBA program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/management/rigour-of-a-global-2-year-mba-in-one-year-113011600095_1.html|website=Business Standard|title=Rigour of a global 2-year MBA in one year|date=January 16, 2013|author=Shikhar Mohan }}</ref>\n\nDesigned as a regular MBA programme, which focuses on using the prior work experience of the students, the one-year MBA is named differently by different IIMs. It is called the Post Graduate Program for Executives at IIM Calcutta and IIM Shillong (PGPEX for short), and at IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Udaipur (PGPX for short). It is called the Executive Post Graduate Programme (EPGP) at IIM Bangalore and IIM Indore, and the International Programme in Management for Executives (IPMX) at IIM Lucknow. The exact structure, admission criteria, and other details of these programmes vary. However, all these programmes admit only candidates with approximately 5 or more years of professional experience and usually use a combination of GMAT score, essays, and personal interviews as entry criteria, similar to other globally reputed MBA programmes. The median GMAT score of the batches at IIM Bangalore is usually around 710.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/postgraduate/epgp/admission/information |title=Admission Information |accessdate= 18 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther than these general variants, many IIMs offer specialty programmes built which focus on different areas, e.g. Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) at IIM Lucknow,<ref name=\"iiml.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iiml.ac.in/programme/post-graduate-programmes/pgp-sm|title=PGP-SM - IIM Lucknow|publisher=}}</ref> Post Graduate Diploma in Human Resource Management (PGDHRM) at IIM Ranchi<ref name=\"iimranchi.ac.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iimranchi.ac.in/?page_id=1014|title=PGDHRM - IIM Ranchi|publisher=}}</ref> and many more.<!-- Adding all specialty programmes is impossible.

The program is called IPM (Integrated Programme in Management) at both the institutes. The course structures are similar though not same at both the institutes. For the first three years, they are taught a combination of \"statistics, economics and humanities\", making them unique in their way. The last two years, they undergo the program with PGP students at their respective institutes. IIM Indore first started this program in 2011 and thereby became the first IIM to have a bachelors program. Four batches of IIM Indore's IPM have been graduated and inducted in the industry. IIM Rohtak has launched this program in 2019 and the first batch is expected to graduate in 2024. IIM Indore offers Bachelor of Arts (Foundations of Management) and MBA (dual-degree) to the graduates of this program. IIM Rohtak has decided to offer Masters of Management Studies (MMS) to five-year graduates and Bachelors of Management Studies (BMS) to students who opt-out after three years.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Doctoral education ===\nIIMs offer a Fellow Programme in Management (FPM) as a full-time doctoral-level programme in management. This programme is aimed at preparing students for careers in teaching or research in different disciplines of management, as well as for careers outside academics that demand a high degree of investigative and analytical ability. A student who completes this programme at any IIM, where (s)he is registered as a doctoral scholar, is awarded the title of ''Fellow'' of that institute (e.g. ''Fellow of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta''). This Fellow Programme is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree. Students receiving such a fellowship every year, across all IIMs, work in close association with one another in specific research areas of their choice.\n\n=== Executive education ===\nMany IIMs offer executive education-certificate programmes targeted at working professionals. These are often short-term or part-time programmes and are known by various names such as  ''Management Development Programme'' (MDP), ''Advanced Masters Program in Management of Global Enterprises'' (AMPM), and ''Executive General Management Programme'' (EGMP). The certificate programmes at IIMs are not considered as equivalent to an MBA or EMBA. Only the diploma-level programmes are considered as equivalent, depending on whether it is full-time or part-time. Many IIMs\u2014such as IIMC, IIMB, IIMK, IIM Kashipur, and IIM Rohtak\u2014have partnered with third-party companies to enable these courses to be provided under a distributed model.\n\n=== Other programmes ===\nSome IIMs offer specialised programmes targeted at various management segments. IIM Ahmedabad offers a six-month, full-time programme called the ''Armed Forces Programme'' (AFP) aimed at military personnel. IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Bangalore offer full-time programmes in [[public management]] and are called the ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Management and Policy'' (PGP-PMP) and ''Post Graduate Programme in Public Policy Management'' (PGPPM), respectively. IIM Bangalore offers a two-year, part-time programme called the ''Post-Graduate Programme in Software Enterprise Management'' (PGPSEM),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iimb.ernet.in/node/2021/|title=Distinctive Features of PGSEM - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore|publisher=}}</ref> an executive general-management education programme designed for the specific needs of professionals working in the software and information-technology industry.

Admission for residents of India to the flagship two-year PGP programmes at all IIMs is based on the [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT).

Some IIMs require candidates to make a presentation of a broad research idea or take a Research Aptitude Test (RAT) followed by round of interviews while all are compelled to accept scores on standardised tests such as the [[Common Admission Test|CAT]], [[Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering|GATE]], [[GMAT]], and [[GRE]]. The overall profiles of candidates, including past academic and professional accomplishments, are considered for all programmes, along with valid standard test scores. Some programmes require essays and academic or professional recommendations. The final round of admission evaluations involve an [[interview]], before which some IIMs conduct other evaluation processes like written assessment tests and group discussions.\n\n=== Entrance exam ===\nThe [[Common Admission Test]] (CAT) is a management aptitude test conducted by the IIMs primarily as an evaluation tool for admission to their two-year PGP programmes.

As per the provisions, 15% of the seats are reserved for students of [[Scheduled Castes]], and 7.5% for [[Scheduled Tribes]]. Since 2008, the [[Other Backward Classes]] have also been given 27% reservation, after the [[Supreme Court of India]] upheld the validity of relevant government regulation. The provisions are being implemented in a phased manner due to resource constraints. All aspirants have to take the [[Common Admission Test]] which consists of an objective-type exam, a group-discussion round, and personal interviews, with the cut-off for reserved-category candidates being possibly lower than for general-category candidates. Once admitted to a programme, a reserved category student has to meet all the criteria for completing the programme as a general-category student.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian [[Territory of Papua]]. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese [[South Seas Detachment]] under Major General [[Tomitar\u014d Horii]] and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of [[New Guinea Force]]. The Japanese objective was to seize [[Port Moresby]] by an overland advance from the north coast, following the [[Kokoda Track]] over the mountains of the [[Owen Stanley Range]], as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established [[beachhead]]s near [[Gona]] and [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] on 21 July 1942. Opposed by [[Maroubra Force]], then consisting of four [[platoon]]s of the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Battalion]] and elements of the [[Papuan Infantry Battalion]], they quickly advanced and captured [[Kokoda]] and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]] narrowly avoided capture in the [[Battle of Mission Ridge \u2013 Brigade Hill]] from 6 to 8 September. In the [[Battle of Ioribaiwa]] from 13 to 16 September, the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]] under [[Brigadier]] [[Kenneth Eather]] fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]]. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around [[Second Battle of Eora Creek \u2013 Templeton's Crossing|Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village]] from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, [[Battle of Oivi\u2013Gorari|a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari]] from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] had crossed the [[Kumusi River]] at [[Wairopi]], and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]] held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the [[Vickers machine gun]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|medium mortars]] were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna\u2013Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], and General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought\u2014to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and incorporated into the [[Anzac spirit|Anzac legend]] even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic context===\n{{Main||Military history of Australia during World War II|Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II}}\n[[File:ABDA Japanese attacks.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese attacks along the Malay Barrier 23 December 1941 \u2013 21 February 1942.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], deployed to Malaya, [[Battle of Ambon|Ambon]], [[Battle of Timor|Timor]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]], was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=490}} The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) was too small to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=458, 468}} The [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment.{{sfn|Grey |1999| p=171}} In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]]s of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, [[John Curtin]], refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at [[Ceylon]], where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.{{sfn|Day |1999|pp=452\u2013457}}\n\nThe Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|considered invading Australia]] in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year,{{sfn|Stanley |2008|p=156}} as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken.{{sfn|Stanley|2007|p=29}} Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing [[Port Moresby]],{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=10}} the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[New Caledonia]].{{sfn|Horner|1993|pp=4\u20135}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=200}} An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]], [[Operation Mo]], was thwarted by the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet was destroyed in the [[Battle of Midway]], further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Curtin MacArthur Blamey (042766).jpg|thumb|right|General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (centre) with General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] (left) and Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] (right) in March 1942]]\nMeanwhile, the Allied [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander]] in the [[South West Pacific Area]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau\u2013Mullins Harbor area. [[Milne Bay]] was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip at [[Merauke]], on the south coast of [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=40\u201342}} On 9 June, MacArthur questioned [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], the commander of Allied Land Forces, as to measures taken for the defence of the overland approach from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]].

An initial reconnaissance, landed by flying boat, was conducted on 10 and 11 July.

There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea.{{sfn|Brune| 2003|pp=84\u201385}} There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=xvi\u2013xvii & 47}}{{refn|Milner refers to the strip at Buna as being \"small and neglected\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=50}}|group=notes}}\n\nThe village of [[Kokoda]] is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately {{convert|160|km|round=5}}.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=98}} The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately {{convert|25|km}} east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope).{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=110}} There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=61}}{{refn|After the initial landing, it was quickly made trafficable for {{convert|60|km|round=5}} from the coast to Sonbo.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=107}}|group=notes}}\n\nIn 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda {{Convert|96|km}} overland ({{Convert|60|km|0}} in a straight line) through the [[Owen Stanley Range]] towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \"main track\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, {{convert|61|km|mi}} from Port Moresby.{{sfn|James|2009|p=60}} The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around {{convert|11|km|mi}} of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}\n\nThe Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \"the (Kokoda) Gap\".{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=171}} To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts,{{sfn|Collie|Marutani|2009|p=55}} it potentially offered a corridor from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=17}} In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about {{convert|11|km|sigfig=1}} wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=110}}\n\nThe track reaches a height of {{Convert|2190|m|4=0}} as it passes around the peak of [[Mount Bellamy]].{{sfn|P\u00e9russe|1993|p=98}} The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to {{convert|5000|m}} up and down over the full length of the track.{{refn|The Kokoda Track Commemorative web site<ref name=\"DVA Topo\">{{cite web|title=Topography of Kokoda|url=http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|website=The Kokoda Track|publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=29 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314053321/http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|archivedate=14 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and James{{sfn|James|2009|loc=trek map}} give a cross-section of the track.|group=notes}} This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around [[Myola]].

A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed.{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}} On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek.

Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \"starts and ends with malaria\". Malarial [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of [[quinine]]. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] or the subsequent operations at Buna\u2013Gona.{{sfn|Walker|1956|pp=12, 70\u201371 & 108\u2013124}}\n\nAnderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops,{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=125\u2013126}} while James reports that \"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track.{{sfn|James|2009|p=20}} Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection.{{sfn|Walker|1956|p=72}}\n\n===Japanese forces===\n{{main|Order of battle for the Kokoda Track campaign}}\nThe [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]] was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=25}} Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby.

The 15th&nbsp;Independent Engineer Regiment (less one company) and the South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii were assigned to these tasks.

Morris said to Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]] on handing over command of NGF, \"The mountains will beat the Nips and we must be careful they don\u2019t beat us.\"{{sfn|James|2009|p=9}}\n\nSubstantially devoid of infrastructure, Morris had set about an ongoing programme to expand, improve and develop harbour and airfield facilities at Port Moresby. Opened in early October, a T-shaped wharf was constructed on Tatana Island. It more than doubled the capacity of the port.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=103}} Under orders from GHQ, an airfield and subsequent port facilities were developed at Milne Bay. This saw Allied forces fortuitously placed to counter the Japanese landing that occurred there. Roads were virtually non-existent. In concert with orders to deploy Maroubra Force to Kokoda, Lieutenant [[Herbert Thomson Kienzle|Bert Kienzle]] was ordered to construct an overland road for its resupply. Historian Peter Brune describes it as \"one of the most ludicrous\" orders ever given.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=97}} Just over {{convert|11|km}} of road was completed by the end of September 1942, from McDonald's to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=26}}\n\nKienzle guided Templeton's B Company of the 39th Battalion across the track to Kokoda. As they went, Kienzle identified staging points along the track and made arrangements for provisioning them. When they arrived at Kokoda, food was running low. Kienzle made a brief visit to his homestead in the Yodda Valley and returned with supplies.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=117}} The trek was considered too arduous for the soldiers to carry any heavy equipment. Arrangements had been made for a coastal vessel to transport supplies and other equipment to Buna. It was unloaded the day prior to the Japanese commencing their landings at Basabua, northward around the coast, near Gona.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=125}}{{refn|The vessel having arrived on 19 July.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=63}}|group=notes}} While Kokoda was held, it was possible to resupply by air landing. Owen flew into Kokoda to take command on 24 July. On 26 July, a platoon of D Company was landed. Lacking serviceable aircraft, this was done in two lifts by a single plane.{{refn|{{harvnb|Anderson|2014|p=31}} reports that the reinforcement was made by a single plane in two flights; however, {{harvnb|Kelly|2003|p=354}} identifies it was flown by two different planes of different types and is able to identify them by type. {{harvnb|Moremon|2000|pp=130\u2013131}} reports that there were only two transports at Port Moresby at the time, having just arrived from Australia, and one of these was declared unserviceable on arrival with engine problems. Anderson reports the flight time to Kododa as 20 minutes with there being 90 minutes between each fight landing at Kokoda.|group=notes}}\n\nHaving returned overland, Kienzle made a report on the supply situation. A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6\u00bd days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=117\u2013118}} Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola.{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1pp=130\u2013131|Kienzle|2011|2pp=136\u2013139|James|2009|3pp=31\u201332|Fitzsimons|2004|4pp=214\u2013215}} Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named.{{sfn|Brune|2003|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}}\n\n[[File:AWM 013002 2 man load.jpg|thumb|right|Papuan carriers with a two-man load, moving along the track (AWM013002)]]\n\nWhile the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all. Air drops requested during the second battle at Kokoda were delayed by weather\u2014which frequently interfered with air operations over the range.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=46\u201347}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp =137 & 140}} At the start of the campaign, effective air dropping techniques had not been developed. Belated drops to Kokoda were made by fighters because of the lack of transports. Belly tanks were filled with supplies but this could not be widely used.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=131}} Parachutes were not initially available and, after a quantity were delivered in mid-September, remained in short supply and were reserved for essential equipment.{{refn|A requisition to the US was made on 21 July for 5,000 parachutes and containers.

Moremon says that no aircraft were available for dropping until 23 August while McCathy states this as 22 August. Given the tenuous supply situation, this was a significant break.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=198}}{{sfn|Moremon|2000|p=174}} Civilian aircraft and pilots were pressed into service in an effort to meet demand.

Potts arrived at Myola on 21 August to find only 8,000 rations (five days' reserve) and a further two days' reserve forward. Potts was forced to hold his force at Myola until a sufficient reserve could be accumulated\u2014which impacted his conduct of the battle at Isurava (commencing 26 August).{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1pp=52\u201354|Brune|2003|2p=158|Gillison|1962|3p=601|McCarthy|1959|4pp=195\u2013196, 199}}\n\nThe \"missing\" rations have been the subject of investigation\u2014both at the time and subsequently.

Transport aircraft in the theatre at this time were largely operated by the [[Fifth Air Force]], with Major General [[George Kenney]] commanding Allied Air Forces. MacArthur released six [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas Dauntless]] dive bombers, one [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] and two transports. He noted that, at the time, there were only thirty transport planes in Australia and, of these, only 50 per cent were available at any one time.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=124}} His response stated that the resources being made available should be sufficient for the {{convert|20000|lb|kg|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of supplies necessary to supply forces at [[Kanga Force|Wau]] and along the track (as estimated by Rowell) each day. The figure supplied by Rowell explicitly did not allow for any reserve to be established.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|pp=601\u2013602}} MacArthur concluded by saying:\n{{bquote|Air supply must necessarily be considered an emergency rather than a normal means of supply. Consequently every effort should be made by the GOC, NGF, to develop other means of supply.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|p=602}}}}\n\nWhen Potts asked for some additional 800 labourers to help alleviate the supply situation, Rowell replied that only 300 could be provided. There was simply not the labour force available to establish a reserve.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|p=601}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=198}} As Allen was advancing, he estimated that he required 3,000 carriers to support his operations forward of Myola but in late October, there were only 1,250 forward of Myola and none to the rear.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=308}} During the Australian advance, Myola 2 was developed as the major resupply point.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=410}} A strip was developed there, being a larger area, but it was considered too risky for general use.{{sfn|Gillison|1962|p=630}}\n\n[[File:Kokoda C47 (AWM 027019).jpg|thumb|alt=A transport plane flying at low level away from the camera, dropping supplies over a clearing in the jungle|A US [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] transport plane dropping supplies to the Australian 25th Brigade near Nauro Village in October 1942]]\n\nAs Potts withdrew from Isurava, Myola was lost\u2014his force destroying anything usable as it left. Successive withdrawals towards the start of the track eased the supply burden. As Allen advanced, following the withdrawing Japanese forces, he was acutely aware of the logistical problems facing his force. He faced pressure from Blamey and MacArthur to advance his forces without being able to assure their supply. His reluctance to do so was a significant factor leading to his replacement.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=198 & 201\u2013203}} McCarthy observes: \"There was little that General Vasey could add immediately to General Allen's planning.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=311}}\n\n====Japanese logistics====\n[[File:AWM 151044 clearing grass and obstacles from the Kokoda airstrip.jpg|thumb|left|Australian troops clearing grass and obstacles from the airstrip at Kokoda.

Meanwhile, allied airpower interfered with the Japanese line-of-communication, particularly at the Kumusi River, making it uncrossable by day. Soldiers advanced from Kokoda carrying 16 days' rations. The advance, from the end of July until Ioribaiwa, in mid September was to last for over forty-five days.

A Caucasian man wearing military uniform is standing on the bridge, and two other Caucasian men are swimming in the river.|Papuan carriers in Australian service crossing a river between Nauro and Menari in October 1942]]\nThe pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=116}} While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=132}}\n\nOn their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \"[[Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels]]\".{{sfn|Rogerson|2012|p=5}} There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered.{{sfn|James|2009|p=18}} In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\", while [[Frank Kingsley Norris]] recounted that, \"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available\u2014regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Brune|2003|pp=188\u2013189}}.</ref>\n\nThe carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600. The total number that worked on the track was significantly larger, with attrition through desertion and sickness. Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=211 & 214}} The ever-increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\nThe Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=117}}\n\n====Medical====\n[[File:AWM P02424.085 air ambulance at kokoda.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942 (AWM P02424.085)]]\n\nWhen the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured. This was discarded as it quickly became apparent that this would not happen and any serious casualties were moved back toward Myola. Potts had requested air evacuation but this was refused for a lack of suitable aircraft.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=213\u2013215}}\n\nAs Myola was threatened by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered there had to be evacuated to the head of the track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \"absolute ruthlessness\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured [[patella]] (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Brief Account of the activities of the 7th Australian Division \u2013 Medical Services during Six Months Campaign in Papua|year=1943|journal=AWM|page=54|volume=481/12/13}}</ref>\n\nAs the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point. Aircraft were sent from Australia and approximately 40 patients were evacuated by air before a [[Ford Trimotor]] and a single-engined [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] of unspecified model both crashed and further air evacuation from Myola was suspended.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=317}}\n\nWith the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as C\u201347s landing with supplies, [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda.{{refn|See caption for AWM photograph {{cite web|title=P02424.085|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P02424.085}} for details. {{cite web|title=150934|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/150934/}} identifies the plane in that photograph as an [[Aeronca L-3]] but the distinctive difference in the engine cowling identifies this as an L\u20131.|group=notes}} At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded.

The Japanese use of artillery pieces in each Kokoda battle was a force multiplier, and the Australians were never able to match the Japanese ranged weapons.\" He attributes around 35 per cent of the Australian casualties to the Japanese artillery but observes that the effect upon morale was perhaps of equal significance: \"The helplessness felt by the men who were subjected to relentless bombardment without the means to retaliate sapped both their number and their spirit.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=111}} Williams asserts that: \"Japanese artillery provided an important, perhaps decisive, role on the battlefields of the Kokoda Track.\"{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=161}}\n\n====Other equipment====\n[[File:AWM P02038.146 James Pashley.jpg|thumb|left|Radio set operated by Signalman James Pashley (AWM P02038.146)]]\n\nAustralian soldiers initially entered battle wearing a khaki uniform which contrasted with the darker greens of the jungle. Moreover, webbing of the 21st Brigade had been bleached white from their service in Syria. In contrast, the Japanese wore a green uniform more suited to the jungle environment and were adept at camouflage. By the time the 25th Brigade was committed to the fighting, it was wearing jungle green\u2014albeit that these were khaki uniforms that had been quickly dyed. This dye ran and caused skin complaints among the wearers.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=118}}\n\nMuch of the Australian equipment was standardised across the British army and the Commonwealth. This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u201388}} Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \"excessive handling\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008|pp=216\u2013217}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=171}}\n\nCaptured stocks of [[Mills bomb]]s (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese.

On 9 September, Army Minister [[Frank Forde]] directed Blamey to visit Port Moresby, which he did, from 12 to 14 September. On his return, he was able to assure the government of his confidence in Rowell and that the situation was in hand.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=200\u2013201}} Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \"energise the situation\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=235}} By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell.{{sfnm|McAulay|1992b|1p=72|Fitzsimons|2004|2p=382|Brune|2003|3p=245|Horner|1978|4p=162}}\n\nMacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October.

It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=236}} McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=235\u2013237}} Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=185}} Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=199\u2013200}} Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=199\u2013203}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=236\u2013240}} Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General [[Cyril Clowes]] at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\"{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=236}}\n\nWhile the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to [[Wanigela, Oro Province|Wanigela]].{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=237}} Major General [[George Kenney]] noted that Rowell was \"not even consulted anymore\".{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=110}} Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September.

The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959||pp=260\u2013261}}\n\nOn 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \"hard terms\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=260\u2013262}} Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola\u2014effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=198}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=129}} Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \"extremely risky\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013131 & 206\u2013207}}\n\nOn 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey:\n{{bquote|General MacArthur considers quote extremely light casualties indicate no serious effort yet made to displace enemy unquote. You will attack enemy with energy and all possible speed at each point of resistance. Essential that Kokoda airfield be taken at earliest. Apparent enemy gaining time by delaying you with inferior strength.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=274}}}}\n\nAllen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer.{{refn|Lieutenant Colonel Minogue, a liaison officer from HQ NGF was forward with Allen, attending a conference at Myola on 23 October, but Blamey acted to relieve Allen before his report was received|group=notes}}{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=208|Horner|1978|2p=206}} MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\" Allen replied, in part: \"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=290\u2013291}} Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \"botched\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack.

Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command.{{sfn|James|2009|p=15}} Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \"mishandling\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=152}} Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\".{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=100}} On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade.\n\nHowever, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \"running rabbit\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated\u2014the men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=204}}{{refn|This dressing-down indicates the intent of Blamey's subsequent address that day to the soldiers of the 21st Brigade.|group=notes}} Potts was transferred to command the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]].

Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a [[Parade (military)|parade ground]]. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \"beaten\" by inferior forces, and that \"no soldier should be afraid to die\". \"Remember,\" Blamey was reported as saying, \"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\"{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \"eyes right\" order.{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \"[[Run Rabbit Run|run, rabbit, run]]\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war).{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\n=====Analysis=====\n[[File:AWM 151139 Lieutenant General Edmund Herring.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Edmund Herring (AWM151139)]]\n\nHistorian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical{{Single double}}.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley|Robert Ghormley]], Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \"complicated operational and strategic contexts\", stating that, \"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General [[Stephen J. Chamberlin]] (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, [[Richard K. Sutherland]], of 30 October 1942: \"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous).{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=225}}\n\nHowever, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\"{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=214}} While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill,{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=528}}{{refn|Churchill wished to divert at least part of the force to Burma.|group=notes}} Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=207}} His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=135\u2013223}}\n\nHorner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means. Blamey acted to placate MacArthur because he (Blamey) was unwilling to risk his own job. Blamey had demonstrated \"a remarkable lack of loyalty\" toward his subordinate. To some degree, Herring shares in this criticism.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=211 & 213}} Williams, however, observes that Allen's advance was nonetheless slower than might reasonably have been expected and that the criticisms leveled at him and leading to his sacking were reasonably justified.{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=205}}\n\nHorner observes of Rowell, that his only failure was an inability to work with Blamey and that Blamey was more culpable in that, he was unwilling to risk his own position. He should have shown more trust and loyalty toward his subordinate; negated MacArthur's manoeuvring and avoided the situation.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nRegardless of the justifications made, the sackings created a climate of suspicion, animosity, personal rivalries and a \"toxic atmosphere\" which pervaded the senior ranks and was detrimental to the war effort.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=199}} Horner observes that Blamey trod a precarious line between \"maintaining his own position and protecting the Australian commanders, between risking his own replacement and risking the distrust of his subordinates\".{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=280}} Horner notes, \"the arguments between generals and politicians might seem of little consequence. But the opposite is the case. It was errors by men like MacArthur and Blamey which lead to the near disaster in New Guinea.

The 1942 [[newsreel]] documentary, ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'' documented the Australian fighting during the campaign and brought the war home for many Australians. Filmed by [[Damien Parer]], it won an [[15th Academy Awards|Oscar]] for the documentary category \u2013 the first time an Australian film/documentary was awarded an Oscar.{{refn|It was shared with three other winners.|group=notes}} Curator, Poppy De Souza, observes: \"This iconic newsreel contains some of the most recognised images of Australian troops in the Second World War, images that have contributed to the collective visual memory of the events at Kokoda. ...[quoting Parer] a war that seemed until this point 'a million miles away\u2019\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/notes/|title=Kokoda Front Line!

Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=226\u2013227}} In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua\u2014widely criticised at the time\u2014led to an eventual, though costly, victory.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that \"the only result, strategically speaking\" of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua \"was that after six months of bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the South West Pacific Area was exactly where it would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=378}} More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}}\n\nThe campaign also served to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual soldiers and the lower level commanders.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna\u2013Gona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}}{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=376}} Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of [[Jungle division]]s which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction in the scale of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the [[Universal Carrier|carrier]] platoon.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u2013101}} The [[Land Warfare Centre (Australia)|Land Warfare Centre]], as it is now known, was established at [[Canungra, Queensland]], with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}} Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008}}{{sfn|Threlfall|2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway]]\n* [[The Kokoda Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist|20em}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Jack |last2=Cutts |first2=Chris |year=1994 |title=As It Seemed To Us: The 1st Australian Mountain Battery, RAA, AIF |publisher=AEbis |location=Brisbane, Queensland |isbn=978-0-646-17515-7 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Nicholas |title=To Kokoda |series=Australian Army Campaigns Series \u2013 14 |year=2014 |publisher=Big Sky Publishing |location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=978-1-922132-95-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Blakeley, Herbert|title=The 32nd Infantry Division in World War II|publisher=Thirty-Second Infantry Division History Commission|location=Maison, Wisconsin|year=1957|oclc=3465460}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Brune|first=Peter|title=A Bastard of a Place: The Australians in Papua|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|location=Crows Nest, New South Wales|year=2003|isbn=1-74114-403-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bullard |first=Steven (translator) |title=Japanese Army Operations in the South Pacific Area: New Britain and Papua Campaigns, 1942\u201343 |publisher=Australian War Memorial| year=2007 |location=Canberra |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/088031725e4569e4ca256f4f00126373/1fcb61d633972daaca257291000abf44?OpenDocument |isbn=978-0-9751904-8-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Coates |first=John|authorlink=John Coates (general) |title=An Atlas of Australia's Wars |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=0-19-555914-2 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last1 = Collie | first1 = Craig | last2 = Marutani | first2 = Hajime | title = The Path of Infinite Sorrow: The Japanese on the Kokoda Track | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = Crows Nest, New South Wales | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-74175-839-9 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year= 1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Craven|first=Wesley|author2=Cate, James |title=Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume 1: Plans and Early Operations\u2014January 1938 to August 1942|year=1948|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago |oclc=704158}}\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=David|title=John Curtin.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian [[Territory of Papua]]. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese [[South Seas Detachment]] under Major General [[Tomitar\u014d Horii]] and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of [[New Guinea Force]]. The Japanese objective was to seize [[Port Moresby]] by an overland advance from the north coast, following the [[Kokoda Track]] over the mountains of the [[Owen Stanley Range]], as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established [[beachhead]]s near [[Gona]] and [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] on 21 July 1942. Opposed by [[Maroubra Force]], then consisting of four [[platoon]]s of the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Battalion]] and elements of the [[Papuan Infantry Battalion]], they quickly advanced and captured [[Kokoda]] and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]] narrowly avoided capture in the [[Battle of Mission Ridge \u2013 Brigade Hill]] from 6 to 8 September. In the [[Battle of Ioribaiwa]] from 13 to 16 September, the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]] under [[Brigadier]] [[Kenneth Eather]] fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]]. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around [[Second Battle of Eora Creek \u2013 Templeton's Crossing|Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village]] from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, [[Battle of Oivi\u2013Gorari|a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari]] from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] had crossed the [[Kumusi River]] at [[Wairopi]], and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]] held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the [[Vickers machine gun]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|medium mortars]] were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna\u2013Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], and General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought\u2014to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and incorporated into the [[Anzac spirit|Anzac legend]] even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic context===\n{{Main||Military history of Australia during World War II|Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II}}\n[[File:ABDA Japanese attacks.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese attacks along the Malay Barrier 23 December 1941 \u2013 21 February 1942.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], deployed to Malaya, [[Battle of Ambon|Ambon]], [[Battle of Timor|Timor]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]], was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=490}} The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) was too small to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=458, 468}} The [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment.{{sfn|Grey |1999| p=171}} In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]]s of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, [[John Curtin]], refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at [[Ceylon]], where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.{{sfn|Day |1999|pp=452\u2013457}}\n\nThe Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|considered invading Australia]] in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year,{{sfn|Stanley |2008|p=156}} as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken.{{sfn|Stanley|2007|p=29}} Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing [[Port Moresby]],{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=10}} the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[New Caledonia]].{{sfn|Horner|1993|pp=4\u20135}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=200}} An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]], [[Operation Mo]], was thwarted by the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet was destroyed in the [[Battle of Midway]], further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Curtin MacArthur Blamey (042766).jpg|thumb|right|General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (centre) with General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] (left) and Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] (right) in March 1942]]\nMeanwhile, the Allied [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander]] in the [[South West Pacific Area]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau\u2013Mullins Harbor area. [[Milne Bay]] was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June.

There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea.{{sfn|Brune| 2003|pp=84\u201385}} There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=xvi\u2013xvii & 47}}{{refn|Milner refers to the strip at Buna as being \"small and neglected\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=50}}|group=notes}}\n\nThe village of [[Kokoda]] is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately {{convert|160|km|round=5}}.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=98}} The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately {{convert|25|km}} east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope).{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=110}} There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=61}}{{refn|After the initial landing, it was quickly made trafficable for {{convert|60|km|round=5}} from the coast to Sonbo.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=107}}|group=notes}}\n\nIn 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda {{Convert|96|km}} overland ({{Convert|60|km|0}} in a straight line) through the [[Owen Stanley Range]] towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \"main track\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, {{convert|61|km|order=flip}} from Port Moresby.{{sfn|James|2009|p=60}} The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around {{convert|7|mi|km}} of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}\n\nThe Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \"the (Kokoda) Gap\".{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=171}} To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts,{{sfn|Collie|Marutani|2009|p=55}} it potentially offered a corridor from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=17}} In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about {{convert|11|km|sigfig=1}} wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=110}}\n\nThe track reaches a height of {{Convert|2190|m|4=0}} as it passes around the peak of [[Mount Bellamy]].{{sfn|P\u00e9russe|1993|p=98}} The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to {{convert|5000|m}} up and down over the full length of the track.{{refn|The Kokoda Track Commemorative web site<ref name=\"DVA Topo\">{{cite web|title=Topography of Kokoda|url=http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|website=The Kokoda Track|publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=29 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314053321/http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|archivedate=14 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and James{{sfn|James|2009|loc=trek map}} give a cross-section of the track.|group=notes}} This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around [[Myola]]. The vegetation is largely dense jungle. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level, resulting in fog.<ref name=\"DVA Topo\"/>\n\nMyola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed.{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}} On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Disease===\n[[File:AWM P02423.011 2nd 4th field ambulance.jpg|thumb|left|Tents of the 2/4th Field Ambulance near Efogi (AWM P02423.011)]]\n\nOperations in New Guinea were impacted by tropical diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[scrub typhus]], [[tropical ulcer]]s, [[dysentery]] from a range of causes and [[Mycosis|fungal infections]]. Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \"starts and ends with malaria\". Malarial [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of [[quinine]]. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] or the subsequent operations at Buna\u2013Gona.{{sfn|Walker|1956|pp=12, 70\u201371 & 108\u2013124}}\n\nAnderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops,{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=125\u2013126}} while James reports that \"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track.{{sfn|James|2009|p=20}} Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection.{{sfn|Walker|1956|p=72}}\n\n===Japanese forces===\n{{main|Order of battle for the Kokoda Track campaign}}\nThe [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]] was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=25}} Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby. This was based on pre-war intelligence that a road existed linking it with Kokoda. Initial aerial reconnaissance was inconclusive but plans were made for a reconnaissance in force and to exploit the possibility of an advance along such a route. The 15th&nbsp;Independent Engineer Regiment (less one company) and the South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii were assigned to these tasks. At the time, Horii was unenthusiastic as to the possibility of success, in consideration of the logistical difficulties that would be faced, but he did not press his objection.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}\n\nAn advance party, under command of Colonel Yokoyama Yosuke of the 15th&nbsp;Independent Engineer Regiment was to consist of the main force of the regiment, the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of the [[144th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|144th Infantry Regiment]], and the 1st&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion of the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment.

As war in the Pacific approached, there were two local militia units: the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) and the [[New Guinea Volunteer Rifles]]. With growing tensions, the [[49th Battalion (Australia)|49th Battalion]] was sent to Port Moresby in March 1941. On 3 January 1942, the 49th Battalion was joined by the 39th and [[53rd Battalion (Australia)|53rd]] Battalions under command of the [[30th Brigade (Australia)|30th Brigade]].{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=22}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=44}}\n\nAt the end of May, the force protecting Port Moresby was increased by the [[14th Brigade (Australia)|14th Brigade]], consisting of the [[3rd Battalion (Australia)|3rd]], [[36th Battalion (Australia)|36th]] and [[55th Battalion (Australia)|55th]] Battalions.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=561}} The militia units were considered poorly trained, though some effort was taken to infuse them with experienced junior officers,{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=23}}{{refn|The 53rd Battalion received a significantly smaller proportion of these.|group=notes}} most of their time in New Guinea was spent labouring rather than training. Morale in the 53rd Battalion was particularly low. A draft, numbering about one hundred, was drawn from other militia units on short notice. With embarkation in late December, they were denied Christmas leave. Destined for North Queensland they were diverted to New Guinea en route. The disaffection undermined morale and has been cited as a significant factor in respect of the battalion's subsequent performance.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=22}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=44\u201345}}\n\n[[File:AWM 008641 2nd 16th Bn syria.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the [[2/16th Battalion (Australia)|2/16th Battalion]], [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], fuzing [[Mills bomb]]s, [[Battle of Damour|Damour]], during the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign]].

B Company, 39th Battalion assembled a force (including what remained of the PIB) to make a stand near Oivi on 26 July. One platoon remained at Kokoda. Threatened with encirclement, the force at Oivi withdrew south to Deniki. Having lost contact, the platoon at Kokoda also withdrew to Deniki on 27 July. With the force reassembled, it reoccupied the village unopposed on 28 July. The first battle at Kokoda was fought over 28\u201329 July. Repeated, determined attacks caused the Australians to withdraw to Deniki. Owen, commanding officer of the 39th Battalion, was mortally wounded in the fighting.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=27\u201339}}\n\nThere was a pause in the Japanese advance. Remaining companies of the 39th Battalion arrived overland and Major Allan Cameron, Brigade Major of the 30th Brigade was appointed to assume command of the force. He planned an attack for 8 August towards Kokoda, with three companies advancing on different lines. Two of the companies were held up and forced to retire. A Company was able to occupy Kokoda but, isolated and under attack, it withdrew during the night of 9 August. Companies of the 39th Battalion had withdrawn to Deniki by 12 August and were attacked the following morning. With the threat of envelopment, the battalion commenced to withdraw towards Isurava on the morning of 14 August.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=46\u201350}}\n\nMeanwhile, the 53rd Battalion and headquarters 30th Brigade under Brigadier [[Selwyn Porter]] were sent as reinforcements. Two battalions of the 2nd AIF's 21st Brigade under Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] were following. A defensive position was established by Porter at Isurava with the 30th Brigade to be relieved by the 21st Brigade force. As Potts' lead battalion approached, he took command of the combined force to effect the relief. However, the Japanese advance overtook events and, from 26 to 31 August, a battle ensued in which four Japanese battalions were committed. The 53rd Battalion failed to secure the eastern flank and, with the Japanese taking a commanding position to the Australian front, ultimately forced an Australian withdrawal. The 21st Brigade then fought a series of engagements between 31 August and 5 September as it withdrew from Eora Village to Templeton's Crossing.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=51\u201387}}\n\n[[File:Australian 30th Brigade officers at Port Moresby (AWM 025958).jpg|thumb|right|Officers of [[30th Brigade (Australia)|30th Brigade]], July 1942.

With this reinforcement, he determined to make a stand on Mission Ridge, running forward from Brigade Hill. In fighting from 6 to 9 September, two battalions of the brigade withdrew, narrowly avoiding encirclement while the 2/27th Battalion was feared lost until its remnants emerged from the jungle three weeks later.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=88\u2013100}}\n\nFollowing the battle, Potts was recalled to Port Moresby, with Porter being placed in command. The depleted 21st Brigade was withdrawn to Ioribaiwa Ridge. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and awaited relief by the 25th Brigade, under command of Eather. Eather took command of the combined force but the Japanese attacked just as his battalions were taking up position\u2014with fighting over the period 14 to 16 September. He obtained permission to withdraw and consolidate at Imita Ridge\u2014the final defensive position along the Track. Meanwhile, American forces had landed at Guadalcanal on 7 August. Unable to support both operations, Horii was ordered to withdraw. When Eather attacked the Japanese positions on 28 September, he found them abandoned. The Australian forces cautiously pursued the Japanese withdrawal. The [[16th Brigade (Australia)|16th Brigade]] was committed to the advance and direct command passed to the 7th Division, under Major General [[Arthur Samuel Allen|Arthur \"Tubby\" Allen]].{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=101\u2013131}}\n\nThe 25th Brigade took the [[vanguard]]. On 10 October, Myola was occupied unopposed and contact was made with the Japanese defence. The 25th Brigade was held up at Templeton's Crossing from 16 October until the 16th Brigade pushed through on 20 October and advanced towards Eora Village. Here, the advance was held until the Japanese forces withdrew on 28 October. Pressured to hasten the advance by MacArthur, Allan was replaced by Major General [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]] on 28 October. The 7th Division advanced towards Kokoda and, when a patrol reported it unoccupied, it was retaken on 2 November.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=132\u2013193}}\n\nA further battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari from 4 to 11 November.

Hyakutake decided that he only had sufficient troops and material to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal. He prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal in another attempt to recapture the airfield. With the concurrence of the Japanese command staff, he ordered Horii to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided. The Japanese troops were, after several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses, at Ioribaiwa, within {{convert|32|km}} of Port Moresby.{{sfn|Smith |2000| pp=162\u2013193}} There were also concerns that Allied forces might land at Buna at any time.{{sfnm|Bullard|2007|1p=158|Milner|1957|2pp=54\u2013121}}\n\n[[File:AWM 027085 Japanese prisoner captured near Menari.jpg|thumb|right|An emaciated Japanese prisoner capture near Menari as the Australians advanced (AWM027085)]]\n\nBullard, in the introduction to his translation observes:\n{{bquote|... numerous orders and instructions had been issued to commander Horii from the 17th Army and Army General Staff in Tokyo from late August to halt the southward advance of the South Seas Force.

Morris said to Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]] on handing over command of NGF, \"The mountains will beat the Nips and we must be careful they don\u2019t beat us.\"{{sfn|James|2009|p=9}}\n\nSubstantially devoid of infrastructure, Morris had set about an ongoing programme to expand, improve and develop harbour and airfield facilities at Port Moresby. Opened in early October, a T-shaped wharf was constructed on Tatana Island. It more than doubled the capacity of the port.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=103}} Under orders from GHQ, an airfield and subsequent port facilities were developed at Milne Bay. This saw Allied forces fortuitously placed to counter the Japanese landing that occurred there. Roads were virtually non-existent. In concert with orders to deploy Maroubra Force to Kokoda, Lieutenant [[Herbert Thomson Kienzle|Bert Kienzle]] was ordered to construct an overland road for its resupply. Historian Peter Brune describes it as \"one of the most ludicrous\" orders ever given.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=97}} Just over {{convert|11|km}} of road was completed by the end of September 1942, from McDonald's to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=26}}\n\nKienzle guided Templeton's B Company of the 39th Battalion across the track to Kokoda. As they went, Kienzle identified staging points along the track and made arrangements for provisioning them. When they arrived at Kokoda, food was running low. Kienzle made a brief visit to his homestead in the Yodda Valley and returned with supplies.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=117}} The trek was considered too arduous for the soldiers to carry any heavy equipment. Arrangements had been made for a coastal vessel to transport supplies and other equipment to Buna. It was unloaded the day prior to the Japanese commencing their landings at Basabua, northward around the coast, near Gona.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=125}}{{refn|The vessel having arrived on 19 July.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=63}}|group=notes}} While Kokoda was held, it was possible to resupply by air landing. Owen flew into Kokoda to take command on 24 July. On 26 July, a platoon of D Company was landed. Lacking serviceable aircraft, this was done in two lifts by a single plane.{{refn|{{harvnb|Anderson|2014|p=31}} reports that the reinforcement was made by a single plane in two flights; however, {{harvnb|Kelly|2003|p=354}} identifies it was flown by two different planes of different types and is able to identify them by type. {{harvnb|Moremon|2000|pp=130\u2013131}} reports that there were only two transports at Port Moresby at the time, having just arrived from Australia, and one of these was declared unserviceable on arrival with engine problems. Anderson reports the flight time to Kododa as 20 minutes with there being 90 minutes between each fight landing at Kokoda.|group=notes}}\n\nHaving returned overland, Kienzle made a report on the supply situation. A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6\u00bd days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=117\u2013118}} Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola.{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1pp=130\u2013131|Kienzle|2011|2pp=136\u2013139|James|2009|3pp=31\u201332|Fitzsimons|2004|4pp=214\u2013215}} Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named.{{sfn|Brune|2003|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}}\n\n[[File:AWM 013002 2 man load.jpg|thumb|right|Papuan carriers with a two-man load, moving along the track (AWM013002)]]\n\nWhile the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all.

A Caucasian man wearing military uniform is standing on the bridge, and two other Caucasian men are swimming in the river.|Papuan carriers in Australian service crossing a river between Nauro and Menari in October 1942]]\nThe pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=116}} While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=132}}\n\nOn their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \"[[Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels]]\".{{sfn|Rogerson|2012|p=5}} There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered.{{sfn|James|2009|p=18}} In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\", while [[Frank Kingsley Norris]] recounted that, \"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available\u2014regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Brune|2003|pp=188\u2013189}}.</ref>\n\nThe carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600. The total number that worked on the track was significantly larger, with attrition through desertion and sickness. Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=211 & 214}} The ever-increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\nThe Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=117}}\n\n====Medical====\n[[File:AWM P02424.085 air ambulance at kokoda.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942 (AWM P02424.085)]]\n\nWhen the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured. This was discarded as it quickly became apparent that this would not happen and any serious casualties were moved back toward Myola. Potts had requested air evacuation but this was refused for a lack of suitable aircraft.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=213\u2013215}}\n\nAs Myola was threatened by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered there had to be evacuated to the head of the track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \"absolute ruthlessness\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured [[patella]] (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Brief Account of the activities of the 7th Australian Division \u2013 Medical Services during Six Months Campaign in Papua|year=1943|journal=AWM|page=54|volume=481/12/13}}</ref>\n\nAs the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point. Aircraft were sent from Australia and approximately 40 patients were evacuated by air before a [[Ford Trimotor]] and a single-engined [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] of unspecified model both crashed and further air evacuation from Myola was suspended.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=317}}\n\nWith the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as C\u201347s landing with supplies, [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda.{{refn|See caption for AWM photograph {{cite web|title=P02424.085|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P02424.085}} for details. {{cite web|title=150934|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/150934/}} identifies the plane in that photograph as an [[Aeronca L-3]] but the distinctive difference in the engine cowling identifies this as an L\u20131.|group=notes}} At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded.

The Japanese use of artillery pieces in each Kokoda battle was a force multiplier, and the Australians were never able to match the Japanese ranged weapons.\" He attributes around 35 per cent of the Australian casualties to the Japanese artillery but observes that the effect upon morale was perhaps of equal significance: \"The helplessness felt by the men who were subjected to relentless bombardment without the means to retaliate sapped both their number and their spirit.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=111}} Williams asserts that: \"Japanese artillery provided an important, perhaps decisive, role on the battlefields of the Kokoda Track.\"{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=161}}\n\n====Other equipment====\n[[File:AWM P02038.146 James Pashley.jpg|thumb|left|Radio set operated by Signalman James Pashley (AWM P02038.146)]]\n\nAustralian soldiers initially entered battle wearing a khaki uniform which contrasted with the darker greens of the jungle. Moreover, webbing of the 21st Brigade had been bleached white from their service in Syria. In contrast, the Japanese wore a green uniform more suited to the jungle environment and were adept at camouflage. By the time the 25th Brigade was committed to the fighting, it was wearing jungle green\u2014albeit that these were khaki uniforms that had been quickly dyed. This dye ran and caused skin complaints among the wearers.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=118}}\n\nMuch of the Australian equipment was standardised across the British army and the Commonwealth. This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u201388}} Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \"excessive handling\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008|pp=216\u2013217}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=171}}\n\nCaptured stocks of [[Mills bomb]]s (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese.

On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour. He was present as the 16th Brigade, under Brigadier [[John Lloyd (brigadier)|John Lloyd]], was commencing its advance along the track.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=127|Horner|1978|2p=195|McCarthy|1959|3p=280}} He subsequently established his advance headquarters in Port Moresby on 6 November 1942 (just after Kokoda was reoccupied) until January 1943.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=230}}\n\n====Command crisis====\nThe \"command crisis\" is referred to by McCarthy (among others) in the Australian official history as part of a chapter title: \"Ioriabiawa: and a command in crisis\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=229}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=16}} Academic and historian, [[David Horner]]'s first book is titled, ''Crisis of Command: Australian Generalship and the Japanese Threat, 1941\u20131943'', in which he studies the generalship in these early stages of the war with Japan.{{sfn|Horner|1978}} Anderson notes that, while the \"command crisis\" specifically relates to Blamey's sacking of Rowell, the phrase can also be applied to the sackings of Allen and Potts.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=199}}\n\n=====Rowell=====\n[[File:AWM 026583 LIEUTENANT-GENERAL S.F. ROWELL.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell (AWM26583)]]\n\nComplying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 with only a small personal staff. It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=236}} McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=235\u2013237}} Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=185}} Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=199\u2013200}} Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=199\u2013203}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=236\u2013240}} Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General [[Cyril Clowes]] at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\"{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=236}}\n\nWhile the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to [[Wanigela, Oro Province|Wanigela]].{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=237}} Major General [[George Kenney]] noted that Rowell was \"not even consulted anymore\".{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=110}} Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September. In a communication to Curtin, Blamey referred to Rowell as insubordinate and obstructive.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=239}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=202\u2013203}} Rowell was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Edmund Herring]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=238}}\n\n=====Allen=====\nOn 9 September 1942, Allen's command responsibilities were narrowed to the direct prosecution of the Kokoda Track campaign and flank protection.{{refn|New Guinea Force Operation Instruction No. 26 of 9 September 1942.<ref>{{cite web|last1=War Diary: New Guinea Force Headquarters and General (Air) (NG Force HQ & G (Air)|title=AWM52 1/5/51/18: September 1942|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1024132--18-.pdf|pp=103\u2013104 (of pdf)|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>|group=notes}} Important to subsequent events, NGF retained control of aerial resupply.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=227}} The Australian advance commenced with the attack of 28 September against the (abandoned) Japanese positions on Ioribaiwa Ridge. The 16th Brigade commenced to advance forward on 3 October.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=126}}\n\n[[File:AWM 026750 Maj Gen Allen and Brig Eather.jpg|thumb|left|Major General Arthur Allen (left) and Brigadier Ken Eather (centre), September 1942 (AWM026750)]]\n\nAllen had advanced his headquarters to Menari by 11 October. The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959||pp=260\u2013261}}\n\nOn 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \"hard terms\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=260\u2013262}} Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola\u2014effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=198}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=129}} Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \"extremely risky\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013131 & 206\u2013207}}\n\nOn 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey:\n{{bquote|General MacArthur considers quote extremely light casualties indicate no serious effort yet made to displace enemy unquote. You will attack enemy with energy and all possible speed at each point of resistance. Essential that Kokoda airfield be taken at earliest. Apparent enemy gaining time by delaying you with inferior strength.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=274}}}}\n\nAllen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer.{{refn|Lieutenant Colonel Minogue, a liaison officer from HQ NGF was forward with Allen, attending a conference at Myola on 23 October, but Blamey acted to relieve Allen before his report was received|group=notes}}{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=208|Horner|1978|2p=206}} MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\" Allen replied, in part: \"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=290\u2013291}} Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \"botched\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=170}} On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|pp=206\u2013209|Horner|1978|2pp=206\u2013213|McCarthy|1959|3p=307}} Allen had vouched for the judgement and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=192 & 208}}\n\n=====Potts=====\n[[File:AWM 026716 Arnold Potts left.jpg|thumb|left|Brigadier Arnold Potts (left), forward area, September 1942 (AWM026716)]]\n\nPotts had been sent forward to Isurava with orders to attack and recapture Kokoda. Instead, his force was unable to withstand the Japanese attacks and he was forced to conduct a fighting withdrawal, suffering a disastrous defeat at Brigade Hill. Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command.{{sfn|James|2009|p=15}} Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \"mishandling\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=152}} Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\".{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=100}} On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade.\n\nHowever, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \"running rabbit\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated\u2014the men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=204}}{{refn|This dressing-down indicates the intent of Blamey's subsequent address that day to the soldiers of the 21st Brigade.|group=notes}} Potts was transferred to command the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]].

Potts instructed Murdoch to reject all resignations.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=252}}\n\n======The \"running rabbits\" incident======\nOn 22 October, after the relief of the 21st Brigade by the 25th Brigade, Blamey visited [[Koitaki]], near Port Moresby, where the 21st Brigade was encamped. Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a [[Parade (military)|parade ground]]. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \"beaten\" by inferior forces, and that \"no soldier should be afraid to die\". \"Remember,\" Blamey was reported as saying, \"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\"{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \"eyes right\" order.{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \"[[Run Rabbit Run|run, rabbit, run]]\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war).{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\n=====Analysis=====\n[[File:AWM 151139 Lieutenant General Edmund Herring.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Edmund Herring (AWM151139)]]\n\nHistorian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical{{Single double}}.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley|Robert Ghormley]], Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \"complicated operational and strategic contexts\", stating that, \"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General [[Stephen J. Chamberlin]] (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, [[Richard K. Sutherland]], of 30 October 1942: \"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous).{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=225}}\n\nHowever, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\"{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=214}} While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill,{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=528}}{{refn|Churchill wished to divert at least part of the force to Burma.|group=notes}} Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=207}} His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=135\u2013223}}\n\nHorner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means. Blamey acted to placate MacArthur because he (Blamey) was unwilling to risk his own job. Blamey had demonstrated \"a remarkable lack of loyalty\" toward his subordinate. To some degree, Herring shares in this criticism.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=211 & 213}} Williams, however, observes that Allen's advance was nonetheless slower than might reasonably have been expected and that the criticisms leveled at him and leading to his sacking were reasonably justified.{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=205}}\n\nHorner observes of Rowell, that his only failure was an inability to work with Blamey and that Blamey was more culpable in that, he was unwilling to risk his own position. He should have shown more trust and loyalty toward his subordinate; negated MacArthur's manoeuvring and avoided the situation.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nRegardless of the justifications made, the sackings created a climate of suspicion, animosity, personal rivalries and a \"toxic atmosphere\" which pervaded the senior ranks and was detrimental to the war effort.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=199}} Horner observes that Blamey trod a precarious line between \"maintaining his own position and protecting the Australian commanders, between risking his own replacement and risking the distrust of his subordinates\".{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=280}} Horner notes, \"the arguments between generals and politicians might seem of little consequence. But the opposite is the case. It was errors by men like MacArthur and Blamey which lead to the near disaster in New Guinea.

The track followed a spur-line falling north toward Ofi Creek. The 3rd Battalion was positioned on the ridge to its immediate right on the eastern side of the track. It was the major ridgeline before Imita Ridge and the head of the track. Eather planned to attack, advancing past Porters' flanks with two of his battalions\u2014the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] on the western flank and the [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Battalion]] on the eastern flank.

Kusonose's initial attack was made with half of the 3rd/144th Battalion advancing along the axis of the track, while the 2nd/144th Battalion was to make a flanking attack from the west. Kusonose was able to bring fire on the Australian positions from eight guns. Fighting continued through the day but both attacks had been held. An attack on 15 September was made by his reserve, the second half of the 3rd/144th Battalion against what he thought was the eastern flank of the Australian force. Unaware that Maroubra Force had been reinforced, this lodged in a gap between the Australian 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion.

In March 1943 it was withdrawn back to Australia where it was disbanded in July 1943.<ref name=AWM1>{{Cite web|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/U56122?search|title=39th Australian Infantry Battalion|work=Second World War, 1939\u201345 units|publisher= Australian War Memorial|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhile this campaign, Milne Bay and the sea battles of Coral Sea and Midway ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn the citizenry until mid-1943, that an invasion was possible.{{sfn|Stanley|2007|p=29}} Allied operations against Japanese forces in New Guinea, including [[Operation Cartwheel]] and the [[Salamaua\u2013Lae campaign]], continued into 1945.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=393\u2013428}}\n\n===Strengths and casualties===\nA total of 13,500 Japanese were ultimately landed in Papua for the fighting during the campaign.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=146}} Of these, about 6,000 or two regiments, were directly involved in the \"forward areas\" along the Track.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959| pp=234 and 334}}{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=23}} Against this, the Allies assembled approximately 30,000 troops in New Guinea,{{refn|A figure quoted by Blamey to the Australian Advisory War Council on 17 September 1942 and cited by {{harvnb|McCarthy|1959|p=234}}.

Most took a \"[[no quarter]]\" attitude, and killed Japanese personnel rather than attempt to take them prisoner in the infrequent occasions where Japanese troops attempted to surrender. Despite official instructions against doing so, Australian soldiers often took the personal possessions of dead Japanese and there were several instances where gold teeth were taken from corpses. These attitudes were influenced by a view that the Japanese were deceitful, a desire to exact revenge for atrocities committed against Allied personnel (including the killing of prisoners of war) and latent racism.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|p=196}}\n\n===Nomenclature===\n{{details|Kokoda Track#Nomenclature}}\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the correct name for the route over the range is the \"Kokoda Track\" or \"Kokoda Trail\".

Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=226\u2013227}} In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua\u2014widely criticised at the time\u2014led to an eventual, though costly, victory.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that \"the only result, strategically speaking\" of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua \"was that after six months of bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the South West Pacific Area was exactly where it would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=378}} More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}}\n\nThe campaign also served to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual soldiers and the lower level commanders.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna\u2013Gona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}}{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=376}} Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of [[Jungle division]]s which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction in the scale of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the [[Universal Carrier|carrier]] platoon.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u2013101}} The [[Land Warfare Centre (Australia)|Land Warfare Centre]], as it is now known, was established at [[Canungra, Queensland]], with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}} Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008}}{{sfn|Threlfall|2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway]]\n* [[The Kokoda Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist|20em}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Jack |last2=Cutts |first2=Chris |year=1994 |title=As It Seemed To Us: The 1st Australian Mountain Battery, RAA, AIF |publisher=AEbis |location=Brisbane, Queensland |isbn=978-0-646-17515-7 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Nicholas |title=To Kokoda |series=Australian Army Campaigns Series \u2013 14 |year=2014 |publisher=Big Sky Publishing |location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=978-1-922132-95-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Blakeley, Herbert|title=The 32nd Infantry Division in World War II|publisher=Thirty-Second Infantry Division History Commission|location=Maison, Wisconsin|year=1957|oclc=3465460}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Brune|first=Peter|title=A Bastard of a Place: The Australians in Papua|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|location=Crows Nest, New South Wales|year=2003|isbn=1-74114-403-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bullard |first=Steven (translator) |title=Japanese Army Operations in the South Pacific Area: New Britain and Papua Campaigns, 1942\u201343 |publisher=Australian War Memorial| year=2007 |location=Canberra |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/088031725e4569e4ca256f4f00126373/1fcb61d633972daaca257291000abf44?OpenDocument |isbn=978-0-9751904-8-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Coates |first=John|authorlink=John Coates (general) |title=An Atlas of Australia's Wars |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=0-19-555914-2 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last1 = Collie | first1 = Craig | last2 = Marutani | first2 = Hajime | title = The Path of Infinite Sorrow: The Japanese on the Kokoda Track | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = Crows Nest, New South Wales | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-74175-839-9 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year= 1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Craven|first=Wesley|author2=Cate, James |title=Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume 1: Plans and Early Operations\u2014January 1938 to August 1942|year=1948|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago |oclc=704158}}\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=David|title=John Curtin.
