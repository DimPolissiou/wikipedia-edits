Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

The Lemberg Fortress fell on 3 September.

Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements.

Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Examples include the main building of [[Lviv Academy of Commerce]], the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} One monument of the Polish past is the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]] at the square bearing his name.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by [[Jan Piotr Norblin]], [[Marceleo Bacciarelli]], [[Kazimierz Wojniakowski]], [[Antoni Brodowski]], [[Henryk Rodakowski]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Aleksander Gierymski]], [[Jan Stanis\u0142awski (painter)|Jan Stanis\u0142awski]], [[Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski]], [[J\u00f3zef Che\u0142mo\u0144ski]], [[J\u00f3zef Mehoffer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski]], [[Olga Bozna\u0144ska]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw S\u0142owi\u0144ski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the [[Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land]].\n\nAccording to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=T\u00f6rnquist-Plewa |editor1-first=Barbara |title=Whose Memory?

Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated at 1,100. A number of organisations continue to be active.\n\nThe [[Sholem Aleichem]] Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the [[ghetto]] in 1988.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others).

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]]. In 2006\u20132008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled.

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with capital in Lw\u00f3w. On 17 June 1356 King [[Casimir III the Great]] granted it [[Magdeburg rights]]. In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

On the night of 31 October\u20131 November 1918 the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen|Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi)]], which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv.

Following Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937\u20131938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Ma\u0142y Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]], the eastern part of the Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland.

It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wroc\u0142aw]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism.

Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865 L'viv&nbsp;\u2013 the Ensemble of the Historic Centre], UNESCO&nbsp;\u2013 World Heritage.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. The city has been the seat of the Catholic Church in 3 rites: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\n=== Theatre and opera ===\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430.JPG|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]\n\nIn 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.\n\nNowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Boh\u00e8me'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]\n\nThe most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n=== Music ===\nLviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the [[Lviv Conservatory]], and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych|Stanislav Liudkevych]], [[Wojciech Kilar]] and [[Mykola Kolessa]].\n\nFlute virtuoso and composer [[Franz Doppler|Albert Franz Doppler]] (1821\u20131883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist [[Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski]] (1892\u20131993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"''[[Polish Radio Lw\u00f3w]]''\" was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] \u2013 Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]\nPopular throughout Poland was the [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Comic Lw\u00f3w Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski]], the actor [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer]] and [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (\"''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and To\u0144ko\" and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]]. Exactly from the stage of Lviv Philharmonic began their way to the great art world-famous Ukrainian musicians \u2013 [[Oleh Krysa]], Oleksandr Slobodyanik, Yuriy Lysychenko, Maria Chaikovska, also the musicians of new generation \u2013 E. Chupryk, Y. Ermin, Oksana Rapita, Olexandr Kozarenko. Lviv Philharmonic is one of the leading concert institutions in Ukraine, which activities include various forms of promotion of the best examples of the music art \u2013 international festivals, cycles of concerts-monographs, concerts with participation of young musicians, etc.\n\nThe Chamber Orchestra \"Lviv virtuosos\" was organised of the best Lviv musicians in 1994. The orchestra consists of 16\u201340 persons / it depends on programmes/ and in the repertoire are included the musical compositions from Bach, Corelli to modern Ukrainian and European composers. During the short time of its operation, the orchestra acquired the professional level of the best European standards. It is mentioned in more than 100 positive articles of the Ukrainian and foreign musical critics.\n\nLviv is the hometown of the Vocal formation \"[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]]\" and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] winner [[Ruslana]] who has since become well known in Europe and the rest of the world. PikkardiyskaTertsia was created on 24 September 1992 in Lviv, and has won many musical awards. It all began with a quartet performing ancient Ukrainian music from the 15th century, along with adaptations of traditional Ukrainian folk songs.\n\n[[Lviv Organ Hall]] is a place where classical music (organ, symphonic, cameral) and art meet together. 50,000 visitors each year, dozens of musicians from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\nLviv is also the hometown to one of the most successful and popular Ukrainian rock bands, [[Okean Elzy]].\n\n=== Universities and academia ===\n[[File:University Lviv 2009 1.JPG|thumb|left|The front [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]\n[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866\u20131938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanis\u0142aw G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski]] had served as dean of the law department (1889\u20131890) and as the University rector (1908\u20131909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lw\u00f3w]].\n\nIn 1873 in Lviv was founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.\n\nIn 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lw\u00f3w which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nLviv was the home of the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems.

There are over 20 basic recreation park zones, 3 botanical gardens and 16 natural monuments. They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.\n\n* [[Ivan Franko Park]], is the oldest park in the city. Traces of that time may be found in three- hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the abrogation of the Jesuit order in 1773 the territory became the town property. A well-known gardener Bager arranged the territory in the landscape style, and most of the trees were planted within 1885\u20131890.\n* [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky Culture and Recreation Park]], is one of the best organised and modern green zones containing a concert and dance hall, stadium, the town of attractions, central stage, numerous cafes and restaurants. In the park there is a Ferris wheel.\n* [[Stryiskyi Park]], it is considered one of the most picturesque parks in the city. The park numbers over 200 species of trees and plants. It is well known for a vast collection of rare and valuable trees and bushes. At the main entrance gate, you will find a pond with swans.\n* [[Regional Landscape Park Znesinnya|Znesinnya Park]] is an ideal site for cycling, skiing sports, and hiking. Public organisations favour conducting summer camps here (ecological and educational, educational and cognitive).\n* [[Shevchenkivskyi Hay]], in the park there is an open-air museum of Ukrainian wooden architecture.\n* [[High Castle Park]], the park is situated on the highest city hill ({{convert|413|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and occupies the territory of {{convert|36|ha|abbr=off}} consisting of the lower terrace once called Knyazha Hora (Prince Mount), and the upper terrace with a television tower and artificial embankment.\n* [[Zalizni Vody Park]], the park originated from the former garden Zalizna Voda (Iron water) combining Snopkivska street with Novyi Lviv district. The park owes its name to the springs with high iron concentration. This beautiful park with ancient beech trees and numerous paths is a favourite place for many locals.\n* [[Lychakivskyi Park]], founded in 1892 and named after the surrounding suburbs. A botanic garden is situated on the park territory, founded in 1911 and occupying the territory of {{convert|18.5|ha|1|abbr=off}}.\n\n=== Sport ===\nLviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birthplace of Polish [[Association football|football]]. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish [[ice hockey|ice-hockey]] match took place there and two years later the first [[ski jumping|ski-jumping]] competition was organised in nearby [[Slavske|S\u0142awsko]]. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv's gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. ''ulica \u0141yczakowska'') held the first Polish [[track and field]] competition with such sports as the [[long jump]] and [[high jump]]. Lviv's athlete W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ponurski represented Austria in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]]. On 9 July 1922 the first official [[rugby union|rugby]] game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w in which the rugby team of Orze\u0142 Bia\u0142y Lw\u00f3w divided itself into two teams \u2013 \"The Reds\" and \"The Blacks\". The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.\n\n[[File:EURO 2012 Lvov clock.jpg|thumb|left|Clock in Lviv on Prospekt Svobody (Freedom Ave.), showing time to start of EURO 2012. Opera and Ballet Theatre in background]]\nThe first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lw\u00f3w-Krak\u00f3w game. The goal was scored by [[W\u0142odzimierz Chomicki]] who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanis\u0142aw Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Federation]] was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, [[Czarni Lw\u00f3w]] opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogo\u0144, in 1913. Another club, [[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogo\u0144, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). [[Hasmonea Lw\u00f3w|Hasmonea]] was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including [[Kazimierz G\u00f3rski]], [[Ryszard Koncewicz]], [[Micha\u0142 Matyas]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Kuchar]].\n\nIn the period 1900\u20131911 opened most famous football clubs in Lviv.\nProfessor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906.\nHe has organised the  \"Ukrainian Sports circle\" in 1908.\nMuch its pupils in due course in 1911 have formed a sports society with the loud name \"Ukraine\" \u2013  first Ukrainian football club of Lviv.<ref>[http://www.boberskiy.org.ua/indexe.html \"Ivan Bobersky \u2013 training of the first teachers of physical training is connected to his name.\"].</ref>\n\nLviv now has several major professional [[football team|football clubs]] and some smaller clubs. [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], founded in 1963, plays in the first division of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Sometimes citizens of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer during outdoor broadcasts of games.\n\nThere are three major stadiums in Lviv. One of them is the [[Ukraina Stadium]] which is leased to FC Karpaty Lviv until 2018.\n[[Arena Lviv]] is a brand-new football stadium that was an official venue for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] Championship games in Lviv.

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]].

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of [[cycling infrastructure]]<ref>[http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf Lviv City Administration \u2013 Bicycle Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123621/http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> \u2013 until the year 2019 an overall length of {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=on}} cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized.

It can be expected that until the end of the 2011 {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv \u2013 the first such position in Ukraine \u2013 is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.\n\nIn 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] \u2013 the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{convert|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|List of universities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Lvivska politehnika2013.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lviv Polytechnic]] National University.]]\nLviv is an important education centre of Ukraine. The city contains a total of 12 [[university|universities]], 8 academies and a number of smaller schools of higher education. In addition, within Lviv, there is a total of eight institutes of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|National Academy of Science of Ukraine]] and more than forty [[research institute]]s. These research institutes include the [[Lviv Centre of Institute for Space Research|Centre of Institute for Space Research]]; the Institute for [[Condensed Matter Physics]]; the Institute of [[Cell Biology]]; the National Institute of Strategic Studies; the Institute of Neuro-mathematical Simulation in Power Engineering; and the Institute of Ecology of the Carpathians.\n\nIn [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city of Lviv was the location where the software for the [[Lunokhod]] programme was developed. The technology for the [[Venera]] series probes and the first orbital shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] were also developed in Lviv.\n\nA considerable scientific potential is concentrated in the city: by the number of doctors of sciences, candidates of sciences, scientific organisations Lviv is the fourth city in Ukraine. Lviv is also known for ancient academic traditions, founded by the Assumption Brotherhood School and the Jesuit Collegium. Over 100,000 students annually study in more than 50 higher educational establishments.\n\n'''Educational level of residents''':<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141205154901/http://www.city-institute.org/en/Socio/Social_portrait_Eng.jpg Social portrait of Lviv resident]</ref>\n\n* Basic and complete secondary education: 10%\n* Specialized secondary education: 25%\n* Incomplete higher education (undergraduates): 13%\n* Higher education (graduates): 51%\n* Ph.D. (postgraduates): about 1%\n\n=== Universities ===\n[[File:52 Pekarska Street, Lviv (03).jpg|thumb|Anatomy Department Building of [[Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University]] - one of the oldest and prime medical institute of Ukraine.]]\n* [[Lviv University|Ivan Franko National University of Lviv]] (ukr.

Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

Meier integrierte der junge Islam bei seiner raschen Expansion viele heidnische Gottheiten in sein System, indem er sie zu D\u00e4monen degradierte. 1.

According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them.\" Original: \"M.

Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.

It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.\nSN  - 1872-0226\nUR  - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nDO  - 10.1007/s11562-013-0282-7\nID  - \u00d8steb\u00f82014\nER  - \n</ref> For that reason, jinn are taken as serious danger by adherents of Salafism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} [[Saudi Arabia]], following the [[Wahhabism]] strant of Salafism, imposes a [[Capital punishment in Saudi Arabia|death penalty]] for dealing with jinn to prevent [[Magic (supernatural)|sorcery]] and [[witchcraft]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/08/the-death-penalty-in-saudi-arabia-facts-and-figures/ | title=The death penalty in Saudi Arabia: Facts and Figures}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/saudi-arabias-war-on-witchcraft/278701/ | title=Saudi Arabia's War on Witchcraft| date=2013-08-19}}</ref> Contrary to the official teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remained popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology.<ref>PEDRAM PARTOVI\n ''Girls\u2019 Dormitor y : Women\u2019s Islam and Iranian Horror\n''</ref>\n\n[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people.

The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

AcroForms permit using objects (''e.g.'' [[text box]]es, [[Radio button]]s, ''etc.'') and some code (''e.g.'' [[JavaScript]]).\n\nAlongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)\n* Forms Data Format (FDF)\n* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the \"XML\" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)\n* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values, as was defined in PDF 1.4.)\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs.

Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form.

There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption.\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The Text Verification Tool exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.<ref>{{cite web |title = PDF as Standard Print Job Format |url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format |website=The Linux Foundation |publisher=[[Linux Foundation]] |accessdate=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. \n\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] once thought of as one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\"<ref>On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source.

It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)\n* Forms Data Format (FDF)\n* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the \"XML\" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)\n* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values, as was defined in PDF 1.4.)\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/325/325874.html |title=Using Acrobat forms and form data on the web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name=\"xfdf\">{{citation|title=XML Forms Data Format Specification, version 2|date=September 2007|url=https://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/TECH/ADOBE/A070914X.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730100811/https://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/TECH/ADOBE/A070914X.pdf|url-status=dead|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-19|archivedate=2009-12-23}}</ref><ref name=\"fdf-exchange\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/fdf_data_exchange.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDF Data Exchange Specification |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text ([[comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[delimiter-separated values|TSV]]) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n===== Forms Data Format (FDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = Forms Data Format (FDF)\n| icon = \n| logo = \n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| extension = .fdf\n| mime = application/vnd.fdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/ |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 vnd.fdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code = 'FDF'\n| uniform type = \n| magic = \n| owner = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| genre = \n| released = {{Start date|1996}}<!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> (PDF 1.2)\n| latest release version = \n| latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} -->\n| container for = \n| contained by = \n| extended from = PDF\n| extended to = XFDF\n| standard = ISO 32000-2:2017\n| free = Yes\n| url = \n}}\n\nThe Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n===== XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)\n| icon                   =\n| logo                   =\n| screenshot             =\n| caption                =\n| extension              = .xfdf\n| mime                   = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 Vendor Tree \u2013 vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code              = 'XFDF'\n| uniform type           =\n| magic                  =\n| owner                  = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| released               = {{Start date|2003|07|df=yes}} (referenced in PDF 1.5)\n| latest release version = 3.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2009|08|df=yes}}\n| genre                  =\n| container for          =\n| contained by           =\n| extended from          = PDF, FDF, [[XML]]\n| extended to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19444-1<ref name=\"iso-xfdf\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=64911 |title=ISO/CD 19444-1 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0) |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>)\n| free                   =\n| url                    = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160408204348/https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/XFDF_Spec_3.0.pdf XFDF 3.0 specification]\n}}\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption.\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The [[Text Verification Tool]] exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.<ref>{{cite web |title = PDF as Standard Print Job Format |url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format |website=The Linux Foundation |publisher=[[Linux Foundation]] |accessdate=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. \n\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] once thought of as one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\"<ref>On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source.

It has become a document of central importance to the history, to the political constitution of the state, and to the [[national mythos]] of New Zealand, and has played a major role in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government and the M\u0101ori population, especially from the late-20th century.\n\nThe Treaty was written at a time when British colonists and the [[New Zealand Company]] (acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and would-be settlers) were pressuring the British Crown to establish a [[colony]] in New Zealand, and when some M\u0101ori leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French incursions. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]], recognising M\u0101ori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving M\u0101ori the rights of [[British subject]]s. It was intended by the British Crown to ensure that when Lieutenant Governor [[William Hobson]] subsequently made the declaration of British [[sovereignty]] over New Zealand in May 1840, the M\u0101ori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/other/NZConLRes/1839/3.html|title=Additional Instructions from Lord Normanby to Captain Hobson 1839 \u2013 New Zealand Constitutional Law Resources|date=15 August 1839|accessdate=5 October 2019|website=[[New Zealand Legal Information Institute]]}}</ref> Once it had been written and translated, it was first signed by Northern M\u0101ori leaders at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]].

In the period following the New Zealand Wars, the New Zealand government mostly ignored the Treaty, and a court-case judgement in 1877 declared it to be \"a simple nullity\". Beginning in the 1950s, M\u0101ori increasingly sought to use the Treaty as a platform for claiming additional rights to sovereignty and to reclaim lost land, and governments in the 1960s and 1970s responded to these arguments, giving the Treaty an increasingly central role in the interpretation of land rights and relations between M\u0101ori people and the state. In 1975 the new Zealand Parliament passed the [[Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975|Treaty of Waitangi Act]], establishing the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with interpreting the Treaty, researching breaches of the Treaty by the [[British Crown]] or its agents, and suggesting means of redress.<ref name=\"Meaning-Tribunal\" /> In most cases, recommendations of the Tribunal are not binding on the Crown, but settlements totalling almost $1 billion have been awarded to various M\u0101ori groups.<ref name=\"Settlements\" /><ref name=\"Meaning-Tribunal\" /> Various legislation passed in the later part of the 20th century has made reference to the Treaty, but the Treaty has never been made part of New Zealand [[municipal law]].

The second article guarantees all M\u0101ori \"chieftainship over their lands, villages and all their treasures\" (translated), with 'treasures' here translating from ''taonga'' to mean more than just physical possessions (as in the English text), but also other elements of cultural heritage. The second article also says: \"Chiefs will sell land to the Queen at a price agreed to by the person owning it and by the person buying it (the latter being) appointed by the Queen as her purchase agent\" (translated), which does not accurately convey the [[Preemption (land)|pre-emption]] clause of the English text.

The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the interpretation of three M\u0101ori words: ''[[Kawanatanga|k\u0101wanatanga]]'' (governorship), which is ceded to the Queen in the first article; ''[[rangatiratanga]]'' (chieftainship) not ''[[Mana#In New Zealand|mana]]'' (leadership) (which was stated in the Declaration of Independence just five years before the Treaty was signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and ''[[taonga]]'' (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few M\u0101ori involved with The Treaty negotiations understood the concepts of [[sovereignty]] or \"governorship\", as they were used by 19th-century Europeans, and lawyer [[Moana Jackson]] has stated that \"ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in M\u0101ori terms\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Facing the truth about the Maori Wars|publisher=The Mana Trust|year=2016|url=http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003110533/http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|archivedate=3 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, ''[[k\u0101wanatanga]]'' is a [[Calque|loan translation]] from 'governorship' and was not part of the M\u0101ori language. The term had been used by [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chiefs at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] on 28 October 1835.<ref name=\"nzhistory dec of independence\">{{cite web| work = Translation from Archives New Zealand, New Zealand History online| title = The Declaration of Independence| url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| accessdate = 18 August 2010| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707130520/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| archivedate = 7 July 2015| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated \"''Ko te K\u012bngitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua''\" to describe \"all sovereign power and authority in the land\".<ref name=\"nzhistory dec of independence\"/> There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term.

The M\u0101ori text, on the other hand, mentions \"[[taonga]]\", meaning \"treasures\" or \"precious things\". In M\u0101ori usage the term applies much more broadly than the English concept of legal property, and since the 1980s courts have found that the term can encompass intangible things such as language and culture.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Maori Broadcasting Claim: A Pakeha Economist's Perspective|publisher=Brian Easton|year=1990|url=http://www.eastonbh.ac.nz/?p=293|accessdate=1 September 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927093405/http://www.eastonbh.ac.nz/?p=293|archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Waitangi Tribunal on Claims Concerning the Allocation of Radio Frequencies (Wai 26) |publisher=Waitangi Tribunal |year=1990 |url=https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68476762 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622091906/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68476762 |archivedate=22 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title= Radio Spectrum Management and Development Final Report (Wai 776)|publisher=Waitangi Tribunal|year= 1999|url= https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68205950|accessdate= 1 September 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170819231417/https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/WT/reports/reportSummary.html?reportId=wt_DOC_68205950|archivedate= 19 August 2017|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Even where physical property such as land is concerned, differing cultural understandings as to what types of land are able to be privately owned have caused problems, as for example in the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed controversy]] of 2003\u201304.\n\nThe pre-emption clause is generally not well translated.<ref name=\"Orange 2011\" /> While pre-emption was present in the Treaty from the very first draft, it was translated to ''hokonga'', a word which simply meant 'to buy, sell, or trade'.<ref name=\"Orange 2011\" /> Many M\u0101ori apparently believed that they were simply giving the British Queen first offer on land, after which they could sell it to anyone.<ref name=\"Signing the treaty\">{{Cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/making-the-treaty/signing-the-treaty |title=Signing the Treaty |date=1 July 2016 |website=NZ History |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |access-date=23 July 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708174636/https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/treaty/making-the-treaty/signing-the-treaty |archivedate=8 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Orange 2011\" /> Another, less important, difference is that ''Ingarani'', meaning England alone, is used throughout in the M\u0101ori text, whereas \"the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]\" is used in the first paragraph of the English.\n\nBased on these differences, some M\u0101ori academics argue that the two versions of the Treaty are distinctly different documents they refer to as \"Te Tiriti o Waitangi\" and \"The Treaty of Waitangi\",<ref>{{Cite book|title=Colonising Myths: Maori Realities-He Rukuruku Whakaaro|last=Mikaere|first=Ani|publisher=Huia|year=2011|isbn=|location=Wellington|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tekaharoa.com/index.php/tekaharoa/article/view/6/4|title=View of Te Arewhana Kei Roto i Te R\u016bma: An Indigenous Neo-Disputatio on Settler Society, Nullifying Te Tiriti, 'Natural Resources' and Our Collective Future in Aotearoa New Zealand|website=www.tekaharoa.com|language=en-US|access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> and that the M\u0101ori text should take precedence, because it was the one that was signed at Waitangi and by the most signatories.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/14137 |title=Constitutional Intentions: The Treaty Texts |last=Margaret |first=Mutu |date= Feb 2010 |access-date= 15 October 2018}}</ref> The Waitangi Tribunal, tasked with deciding issues raised by the differences between the two texts, also gives additional weight to the M\u0101ori text in its interpretations of the Treaty.<ref name=\"Waitangi Tribunal Meaning\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.waitangitribunal.govt.nz/treaty-of-waitangi/meaning-of-the-treaty/ |title= Meaning of the Treaty |via= Waitangi Tribunal |website= waitangitribunal.govt.nz |language=en-NZ |access-date= 15 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe entire issue is further complicated by the fact that, at the time, writing was a novel introduction to M\u0101ori society. As members of a predominately oral society, M\u0101ori present at the signing of the Treaty would have placed more value and reliance on what Hobson and the missionaries said, rather than the written words of the Treaty document.<ref>Belich, James (1996), ''Making Peoples: A History of the New Zealanders from Polynesian Settlement to the End of the Nineteenth Century'', pp.195\u20136.</ref> Although there is still a great deal of scholarly debate surrounding the extent to which literacy had permeated M\u0101ori society at the time of the signing, what can be stated with clarity is that of the 600 plus [[rangatiratanga|rangatira]] who signed the written document only 12 signed their names in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Many others conveyed their identity by drawing parts of their ''[[T\u0101 moko|moko]]'' (personal facial tattoo), while still others marked the document with an X.<ref name=\"Simpson 2015\"/>\n\nM\u0101ori beliefs and attitudes towards ownership and use of land were different from those prevailing in Britain and Europe. The chiefs would traditionally grant permission for the land to be used for a time for a particular purpose.

This was intended to protect M\u0101ori from the kinds of shady land purchases which had alienated [[indigenous people]]s in other parts of the world from their land with minimal compensation. However, before the Treaty had been finalised the New Zealand Company had made several hasty land deals and shipped settlers from Great Britain to New Zealand, hoping the British would be forced to accept its land claims as a [[Glossary of French expressions in English#Fait accompli|fait accompli]], in which it was largely successful.<ref name=\"Orange 2011\" />\n\nIn part, the Treaty was an attempt to establish a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse.

It has become a document of central importance to the history, to the political constitution of the state, and to the [[national mythos]] of New Zealand, and has played a major role in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government and the M\u0101ori population, especially from the late-20th century.\n\nThe Treaty was written at a time when British colonists and the [[New Zealand Company]] (acting on behalf of large numbers of settlers and would-be settlers) were pressuring the British Crown to establish a [[colony]] in New Zealand, and when some M\u0101ori leaders had petitioned the British for protection against French incursions. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor of New Zealand]], recognising M\u0101ori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving M\u0101ori the rights of [[British subject]]s. It was intended by the British Crown to ensure that when Lieutenant Governor [[William Hobson]] subsequently made the declaration of British [[sovereignty]] over New Zealand in May 1840, the M\u0101ori people would not feel that their rights had been ignored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/other/NZConLRes/1839/3.html|title=Additional Instructions from Lord Normanby to Captain Hobson 1839 \u2013 New Zealand Constitutional Law Resources|date=15 August 1839|accessdate=5 October 2019|website=[[New Zealand Legal Information Institute]]}}</ref> Once it had been written and translated, it was first signed by Northern M\u0101ori leaders at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]].

The second article also says: \"Chiefs will sell land to the Queen at a price agreed to by the person owning it and by the person buying it (the latter being) appointed by the Queen as her purchase agent\" (translated), which does not accurately convey the [[Preemption (land)|pre-emption]] clause of the English text.

The most critical difference between the texts revolves around the interpretation of three M\u0101ori words: ''[[Kawanatanga|k\u0101wanatanga]]'' (governorship), which is ceded to the Queen in the first article; ''[[rangatiratanga]]'' (chieftainship) not ''[[Mana#In New Zealand|mana]]'' (leadership) (which was stated in the Declaration of Independence just five years before the Treaty was signed), which is retained by the chiefs in the second; and ''[[taonga]]'' (property or valued possessions), which the chiefs are guaranteed ownership and control of, also in the second article. Few M\u0101ori involved with The Treaty negotiations understood the concepts of [[sovereignty]] or \"governorship\", as they were used by 19th-century Europeans, and lawyer [[Moana Jackson]] has stated that \"ceding mana or sovereignty in a treaty was legally and culturally incomprehensible in M\u0101ori terms\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Facing the truth about the Maori Wars|publisher=The Mana Trust|year=2016|url=http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003110533/http://www.e-tangata.co.nz/news/moana-jackson-facing-the-truth-about-the-wars|archivedate=3 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, ''[[k\u0101wanatanga]]'' is a [[Calque|loan translation]] from 'governorship' and was not part of the M\u0101ori language. The term had been used by [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chiefs at [[Waitangi, Northland|Waitangi]] on 28 October 1835.<ref name=\"nzhistory dec of independence\">{{cite web| work = Translation from Archives New Zealand, New Zealand History online| title = The Declaration of Independence| url = http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| accessdate = 18 August 2010| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707130520/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/the-declaration-of-independence| archivedate = 7 July 2015| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated \"''Ko te K\u012bngitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua''\" to describe \"all sovereign power and authority in the land\".<ref name=\"nzhistory dec of independence\"/> There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term.
