In Vancouver, Oberlander became interested in the modern art movement led by [[B.C. Binning]] and Ned Pratt, which combined art and architecture to address the connections between urbanism and surrounding natural settings. In 1999\u20132000, she contributed her expertise to the Vancouver Art Gallery's Out of This Century exhibition, guiding patrons through the selection of visual art pieces that were chosen from the gallery's permanent collection (by Oberlander and five other Vancouverites) to reflect and represent the city's art scene through the decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|title = Architecture meets art in new exhibit|date = 1999-12-27|accessdate = 2015-03-08|website = North Shore News|publisher = |last = Christensen|first = Layne|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031129180138/http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|archivedate = 2003-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of Oberlander's career were dedicated to designing landscapes for low-income housing projects and playgrounds, the most famous of which is the Canadian Government Pavilion, Children's Creative Centre & play area for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal.<ref name=\"Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Archive\">[https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/218037/cornelia-hahn-oberlander-fonds Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Fonds] Retrieved 2020-04-14.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander|first=Cornelia Hahn|year=1966|title=Space for Creative Play|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/98626676/Space-for-Creative-Play?ad_group=&campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&content=10079&irgwc=1&keyword=ft750noi&medium=affiliate&source=impactradius|journal=Journal of Canadian Landscape Architects|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Her first playground, for a 1951 public housing project for architect [[Louis Kahn]], included a vegetable garden and a fruit tree.

Before beginning a project she researches it thoroughly to ensure that her innovative schemes will also be practical and long-lasting.  Oberlander always approaches a project from an environmental standpoint, stating in her Convocation Address for the acceptance of an honorary degree from [[Simon Fraser University]]:\n \n<blockquote>I dream of Green Cities with Green Buildings where rural and urban activities live in harmony.[...] \"Achieving a fit\" between the built form and the land has been my dictum. This can only be done if all our design-related professions collaborate and thereby demonstrate co-operatively their relevance in meeting the enormous developmental challenges facing our increasingly crowded urban regions.<ref>[https://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/hdrspeeches/ SFU honorary degree recipients' convocation addresses]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHer concern for the environment and for people in general is further exemplified by her involvement with the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] on Mount Scopus. Oberlander and her husband, Peter, visited Israel for a congress with the International Federation of Landscape Architects in 1962. According to the ''Jewish Independent'', the Oberlanders were in Israel to study irrigation systems but they \"fell more deeply in love with the land and its people.\"<ref name=\"Jewish\">{{Cite web|url = http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|title = Honors for Oberlanders|date = February 13, 2004|accessdate = |website = Jewish Independent|publisher = |last = Berger|first = Kyle|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060203071144/http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|archivedate = 2006-02-03}}</ref> The Oberlanders engaged in and spearheaded many activities to benefit the university from 1979 on, including: setting up a Canadian Studies Program, bringing boxes of Canadian textbooks to Israel for donation to the university, developing a botanical garden, working with a team of planners to assist the community of Ashkalon in accommodating settlers from North Africa and Georgia, and advocating the restoration of historic buildings on the campus.

In Vancouver, Oberlander became interested in the modern art movement led by [[B.C. Binning]] and Ned Pratt, which combined art and architecture to address the connections between urbanism and surrounding natural settings. In 1999\u20132000, she contributed her expertise to the Vancouver Art Gallery's Out of This Century exhibition, guiding patrons through the selection of visual art pieces that were chosen from the gallery's permanent collection (by Oberlander and five other Vancouverites) to reflect and represent the city's art scene through the decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|title = Architecture meets art in new exhibit|date = 1999-12-27|accessdate = 2015-03-08|website = North Shore News|publisher = |last = Christensen|first = Layne|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031129180138/http://www.nsnews.com/issues99/w122799/thiswk_3.html|archivedate = 2003-11-29}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of Oberlander's career were dedicated to designing landscapes for low-income housing projects and playgrounds, the most famous of which is the Canadian Government Pavilion, Children's Creative Centre & play area for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal.<ref name=\"Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Archive\">[https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/archives/218037/cornelia-hahn-oberlander-fonds Cornelia Hahn Oberlander Fonds] Retrieved 2020-04-14.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oberlander|first=Cornelia Hahn|year=1966|title=Space for Creative Play|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/98626676/Space-for-Creative-Play?ad_group=&campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&content=10079&irgwc=1&keyword=ft750noi&medium=affiliate&source=impactradius|journal=Journal of Canadian Landscape Architects|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Her first playground, for a 1951 public housing project for architect [[Louis Kahn]], included a vegetable garden and a fruit tree. In public housing in Maclean Park, she designed a playground.

Before beginning a project she researches it thoroughly to ensure that her innovative schemes will also be practical and long-lasting.  Oberlander always approaches a project from an environmental standpoint, stating in her Convocation Address for the acceptance of an honorary degree from [[Simon Fraser University]]:\n \n<blockquote>I dream of Green Cities with Green Buildings where rural and urban activities live in harmony.[...] \"Achieving a fit\" between the built form and the land has been my dictum. This can only be done if all our design-related professions collaborate and thereby demonstrate co-operatively their relevance in meeting the enormous developmental challenges facing our increasingly crowded urban regions.<ref>[https://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/hdrspeeches/ SFU honorary degree recipients' convocation addresses]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHer concern for the environment and for people in general is further exemplified by her involvement with the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] on Mount Scopus. Oberlander and her husband, Peter, visited Israel for a congress with the International Federation of Landscape Architects in 1962. According to the ''Jewish Independent'', the Oberlanders were in Israel to study irrigation systems but they \"fell more deeply in love with the land and its people.\"<ref name=\"Jewish\">{{Cite web|url = http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|title = Honors for Oberlanders|date = February 13, 2004|accessdate = |website = Jewish Independent|publisher = |last = Berger|first = Kyle|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060203071144/http://jewishbulletin.ca/Archives/Feb04/archives04Feb13-01.html|archivedate = 2006-02-03}}</ref> The Oberlanders engaged in and spearheaded many activities to benefit the university from 1979 on, including: setting up a Canadian Studies Program, bringing boxes of Canadian textbooks to Israel for donation to the university, developing a botanical garden, working with a team of planners to assist the community of Ashkalon in accommodating settlers from North Africa and Georgia, and advocating the restoration of historic buildings on the campus.

He left Seychelles for the first time in July 1949, on board the ''SS Karanja'', a British India steamer, to travel to Europe via [[Bombay]].\n\nAfter attending primary and secondary school in the islands, he went to study medicine at [[University College Cork|University College, Cork]] and qualified [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery#Ireland|M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O.]](National University of Ireland) in 1955.\n\nFirst three medical positions were based in Northampton, before he returned to the Seychelles in 1957.

Once a week, he would travel [[Curieuse Island]], to tend to an isolated population who were suffering from [[Hansen\u2019s disease|Hansen\u2019s disease (leprosy)]]. Dr Ferrari was the only Medical Officer on [[Praslin]] who spent time there. He accompanied the only British Minister to visit these islands, [[John Profumo]], in 1957. Together they\u00a0took time to visit the lepers isolated on Curieuse island. For his care and devotion to the lepers, Dr Ferrari was commended.\n\nDue to his work as an [[obstetrician]] to the majority of the Seychellois population, he was responsible for the delivery of 16,000 babies across a career spanning 16 years.\n\n== Seychellois Politics ==\nHe joined politics and the struggle for Seychellois independence in 1974 and soon became Vice-President of the Seychelles Peoples United Party, which formed into the [[Seychelles People\u2019s Progressive Front]] ([[Seychellois Creole]]: ''Parti Lepep'', PL). This later became known as the [[People's Party (Seychelles)|People's Party]], and now most recently, [[People's Party (Seychelles)|United Seychelles]].\n\nDuring this period, he was an ambassador for the Republic of the Seychelles at the Franco-African Summit in 1981. In 1983 he also represented the Seychelles at the Organisation of African Unity Summit in Addis Ababa, the Commonwealth Heads of State Meeting in New Delhi, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York.

From then on he continued to serve as Minister of Agriculture, then Minister of Planning and Development and finally Minister of Planning and External Relations until resigned in 1984,  due to his disillusionment with politics.\n\nFollowing this, he became Minister of Agriculture and Land Use from 1977-1978. He was then Minister of Planning and Development from 1978-1982, and Minister of Planning and External Relations from 1982-1984.\n\n== United Nations and the Environment ==\nAfter leaving Seychellois politics, Maxime Ferrari joined the [[United Nations Organisation]] and held the post of Regional Representative and Director of the Regional Office for Africa of [[UNEP]].

His work involved organising a wide range of workshops on the topic of [[environmental management]].\n\nHe retired in 1990, founded the [[Seychelles Institute for Democracy]], and made a contribution to the return of multi-party democracy in the country.\n\n== After Politics ==\nSince retiring from [[UNEP]] in 1990, Dr Ferrari has devoted his time to the creation of socially democratic organisations with support that he garnered from groups within the Seychelles and abroad. These are designed to ensure the maintenance of democracy and pluralism in the Seychelles. He founded the [[Rally of the People of Seychelles for Democracy (RPSD)]], [[the Seychelles Institute for Democracy (SID)]] and was the Chairman of the [[United Democratic Movement in the Seychelles.|United Democratic Movement in the Seychelles]].\n\nHe has published numerous articles on the environment and has lectured to scientific communities on environmental policies, as well as on the conservation of endangered species.\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1955 Maxime Ferrari married Ginette Nageon de Lestang. He has five children, Marie-Antoinette, C\u00e9cile, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, Pauline, and Andr\u00e9-Michel.

There he met [[Peter Bellamy]] and joined him as a fellow resident singer in folk clubs in Maidstone and [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. At the same time, Ashley led the art college blues band, The Tea Set, on vocals and blues harmonica.\n\nIn 1967, Ashley qualified with a [[BA Hons]] and returned to London to start his first job as a graphic designer at ''[[The Observer]]'', working with record producer [[Austin John Marshall]]. In 1968, now as a folk songwriter, Ashley formed a duo with guitar player Dave Menday called \"The Tinderbox\". Managed by Marshall, The Tinderbox recorded a single for [[Polydor]] and a session for [[John Peel]] on his [[BBC Radio 1]] ''Nightride' show. The A side, \"Farewell Britannia\" was about the planned removal of the image of [[Britannia]] from the [[Penny (British decimal coin)|British penny]]. Just before the release of the record the image was saved on the [[Fifty pence (British coin)|50 pence piece]] and the single was scrapped. Shortly after, The Tinderbox disbanded.\n\nIn 1971, Marshall landed a production and publishing deal for Ashley with Harbrook Music which gave Ashley free access to recording time at London's [[Olympic Studios]], to record his first album. At this time Marshall also played the early demo tapes to the folk critic [[Karl Dallas]], who interviewed Ashley for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', 1971</ref>\n\nActing as producer for Harbrook Productions, Marshall hired [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]] to create string arrangements for many of Ashley's songs. He also hired a number of musicians to back Ashley, including members of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], plus a section of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], directed by Kirby. By the late summer of 1971, the first version of Ashley's debut album was completed and offered to a number of major and independent labels.\n\n===Albion Country Band and Ragged Robin (1972\u201374)===\nBy the spring of 1972 however, the album was still unplaced with a label, and then Ashley was invited by [[Ashley Hutchings]] to join the first touring ensemble of [[The Albion Country Band]]. This line-up included ex-Fairport members, Hutchings, [[Simon Nicol]] and [[Dave Mattacks]], plus American fiddler [[Sue Draheim]] and ex-Young Tradition singer, [[Royston Wood]].  Sharing the lead vocal role with Wood, Ashley performed a few of his own songs plus a number of folk songs, including a 17-verse [[ballad]], \"[[Young Beichan|Lord Bateman]]\".  The Albion Country Band was signed to [[Island Records]] but the band broke up before recording, after just nine months together.\n\nBy 1973, Ashley formed his own short-lived folk-rock outfit Ragged Robin, with Richard Byers, Brian Diprose and John Thompson. They performed in clubs and colleges, and at [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], and also held a residency at [[Roy Guest]]'s Howff in London's [[Primrose Hill]].<ref>[[Colin Harper|Harper, Colin]]: ''Dazzling Stranger, Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival'', [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], 2000, p. 253,  {{ISBN|0-7475-4810-2}}</ref>\n\nAfter this band folded, Ashley initiated the formation of a contemporary folk club at The New Merlin's Cave near [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross, London]].  With help from Anthea Joseph and Heather Wood \"Merlins\" was host to many of the folk scene's leading players, including [[Sandy Denny]] and [[A L Lloyd]]. The club's resident performers with Ashley were [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Peters]], Simon Nicol, [[Robin Dransfield|Robin]] and [[Barry Dransfield]], Lea Nicholson, and Ragged Robin's Byers.<ref>Hinton, Brian; Wall, Geoff: ''Ashley Hutchings, The Guv\u2019nor & The Rise of Folkrock'', [[Helter Skelter (books)|Helter Skelter]], 2002 pp. 242\u2013259, 279, 286. {{ISBN|1-900924-32-3}}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1973, Dallas described Ashley as \"one of the finest singer-songwriters in Britain, if not the entire English-speaking world\".<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', 15 September 1973</ref>\n\nIn November, Ashley signed a solo recording deal with Gull Records, and with a few track changes, his long-delayed first album was finally released in April 1974 entitled ''[[Stroll On]]''.\n\n===Solo career&nbsp;\u2013 recording, live performance and campaigning (1974\u20131992)===\nAfter a three-year wait to find a deal, ''Stroll On'' was met with widespread critical acclaim in the UK. In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Maurice Rosenbaum declared: \"Ashley's own songs are the product of an extraordinary gift for creating material of true folk quality\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Maurice, Recent Records, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 September 1974</ref> and in ''Melody Maker'', [[Karl Dallas]] hailed it as \"the finest album since folk became contemporary\". By the year's end it was awarded \"Contemporary Folk album of the Year\" in the leading monthly folk magazine, ''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]''.<ref>''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]'', January 1975</ref> During this period, Karl Dallas frequently linked Ashley's name with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], as being in the vanguard of a new approach to folk song writing.<ref>[[Karl Dallas|Dallas, Karl]]; [[Robin Denselow|Denselow, Robin]]; [[Dave Laing|Laing, Dave]]; [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Shelton, Robert]]: ''The Electric Muse, The Story of Folk into Rock'', [[Methuen Publishing]], 1975, pp. 130,169, {{ISBN|0-413-31860-5}}; [[Karl Dallas|Dallas, Karl]]: ''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]'', July 1974 pp.4\u20135, 28</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Gull Records licensed the album to [[Motown]] in the United States and Ashley's first American tour was underwritten by that company. In spring 1975 Ashley undertook a six-week solo tour of the USA and Canada, opening shows for many artists including [[Leon Redbone]], [[Tracy Nelson (singer)|Tracy Nelson]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Chris Hillman]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In a review of his performance in New York's [[Greenwich Village]], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] magazine'' said: \"Steve Ashley... is a delightful surprise ... The performer not only sings his originals well, but has one of the funniest of dry stage raps. His voice is good. His originals are sensitive, ex-of the Albion Country Band, Ashley can hold an audience.\"<ref>''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] magazine'', 11 June 1975</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armandalegmusic.com/features.html |title=Steve Ashley: still strolling on, 40 years on! |last=Weaver |first=Mike |date=August 2014 |website=Armandalegmusic.com |access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBack in the UK he recorded the follow-up, ''Speedy Return'', and undertook a series of solo tour supports for a variety of headline bands, including [[Supertramp]], [[Planxty]], Isotope, Gong and Fruup. However, by the end of 1975, Gull's deal with Motown fell through and Ashley was without a record company.  His planned third album, ''Rare Old Men'', was never released and it was not until 1979 that Fairport's [[Dave Pegg]] recorded, produced and eventually released what was his third album, ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'', on his own Woodworm label. In 1978, Ashley formed the electric folk \"Steve Ashley Band\" and this band performed sporadically for 12 years, including appearances at [[Rotterdam Folk Festival]] (1978), [[Glastonbury Festival]] (1985) and Cambridge Folk Festival (1990).\n\nIn 1978, at the Rotterdam Folk Festival, Ashley met the Australian folk-rock band, [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]], whose leader, Dobe Newton, asked Ashley to write some musical settings of poems by the deceased bush poet, [[Henry Lawson]]. As a result, The Bushwackers recorded three of Ashley's settings, and published four in their ''Australian Song Books''.<ref>''The Bushwackers Australian Songbook'', [[Sphere Books]], 1978, {{ISBN|0-17-005393-8}}; ''The Bushwackers Second Australian Songbook'', Anne O'Donovan Pty Ltd. 1983, {{ISBN|0-908476-12-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Ashley became active in [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s campaign to ban [[Trident missile|Trident]] and remove US [[Cruise missiles]] from the UK.<ref>[[Dave Thompson (author)|Thompson, Dave]]: ''Wheels Out of Gear&nbsp;\u2013 2 Tone The Specials and a world in flame'', [[Helter Skelter (books)|Helter Skelter]], 2004, pp.152\u20133, 157\u20138, 187\u20138, {{ISBN|1-900924-84-6}}</ref> He recorded and released two cassette albums of peace songs. Around this time he began a part-time involvement in [[Oxfam]]'s publicity and campaigning work as a graphic designer and copywriter. During the CND campaign of the 1980s he performed from the main stage at Glastonbury Festival (with [[Bruce Rowland (drummer)|Bruce Rowland]] and Chris Leslie) and also solo to 250,000 peace protesters in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London. He recorded a single with CND's [[Bruce Kent]] and the Labour peer, [[Philip Noel-Baker|Lord Noel-Baker]]. Later, he took part in the blockade of the nuclear weapons factory at [[Burghfield]] and was eventually arrested for obstruction in the mass sit-in at the [[USAF]] base at [[Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire]].  This event was recorded in the song \"Sweet Affinity\" on his next studio release ''Mysterious Ways'' (Line Records, 1990).  In 1992, Ashley retired from the music industry to concentrate on his design and copywriting work for various UK charities.\n\n===Solo \"comeback\" career (1999\u2013present)===\nAfter an eight-year break from music, Ashley was encouraged to return by Peter Muir of the new [[Market Square Records]] label. First they released an anthology of Ashley's work, ''The Test of Time'' (1999) and, shortly after, an upgraded version of his debut album, entitled ''[[Stroll On|Stroll on Revisited]]''. This album met with many welcoming reviews and the original album was celebrated in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in one its regular \"Buried Treasure\" features. Then, in 2001, Ashley signed a two-album deal with [[Topic Records]], and in April they released ''Everyday Lives'', his first studio album for ten years. Back on the road, Ashley performed as a solo artist and in duos with Al Fenn and [[Dik Cadbury]], as well as making occasional guest appearances with Fairport Convention.\n\nIn 2006, Ashley celebrated his 60th birthday with a special concert with Robert Kirby conducting his arrangements for a six-piece chamber orchestra. Also taking part were Ashley's friends from Fairport: [[Dave Pegg]], Chris Leslie, Simon Nicol and [[Martin Allcock]], plus [[Show of Hands]]\u2019 [[Phil Beer]], Planxty's [[Johnny Moynihan]], [[Brass Monkey (band)|Brass Monkey]]'s Martin Brinsford and many other friends, including his old partners from The Tinderbox, Ragged Robin and the Steve Ashley Band. The event was recorded and released six months later as ''Live in Concert'' on Dusk Fire Records. Then in 2007 Ashley released his second album for Topic, ''[[Time and Tide (Steve Ashley album)|Time and Tide]]'', with three new string arrangements by Robert Kirby. From this collection one song \"Best Wishes\" was recorded by Fairport Convention and the female trio Grace Notes.\n\nIn 2015, Market Square released Ashley's first stripped back solo album, ''[[This Little Game]]'', which was included in both ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and [[Folk Radio UK]]'s lists of \"The Best Folk Albums of 2015\". In a four-starred review for ''The Telegraph'', its Culture Editor Martin Chilton said that the album \"shows a craftsman at work...In Your Heart shows he still has a power to move with his songwriting\".<ref name=\"Best\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/best-folk-music-albums-of-2015/ | title=Best Folk Music Albums of 2015 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Chilton, Martin}}</ref> Paul Woodgate, reviewing the album for Folk Radio UK, said: \"This Little Game may just be one of his best\".<ref name=\"Woodgate\">{{cite web | url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2015/02/steve-ashley-this-little-game/ | title=Steve Ashley&nbsp;\u2013 This Little Game | publisher=[[Folk Radio UK]] | work=Album reviews | date=26 February 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Woodgate, Paul}}</ref>\n\nAshley's 2017 solo album ''[[Another Day (Steve Ashley album)|Another Day]]'' was described by [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Colin Irwin]], writing in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', as \"an understated album of sharp observations, lithe melodies and wry asides\".<ref name=\"Irwin\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/mojo-uk/20170124/283523680557316 | title=Steve Ashley: Another Day | work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]| author= [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Irwin, Colin]]|date=24 January 2017 | accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> It received five-starred reviews in ''[[R2 (Rock'n'Reel)]]'', ''FolkWales Online Magazine'' and the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''.\n\n''[[One More Thing (Steve Ashley album)|One More Thing]]'', his solo album released in 2018, received five-starred reviews from the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{Cite news |url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/barnstormers-critical-eyes-and-seedy-hang-outs |title=Barnstormers, critical eyes and seedy hang-outs  |last=Johnson |first=Steve |date=27 September 2018 |work=[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]] |access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> and ''FolkWales Online Magazine''.<ref name=\"FolkWales \">{{Cite magazine |last=Tems |first=Mick |date=November 2018 |title=One More Thing |url=http://folk.wales/magazine/?p=315#One_More_Thing |magazine=FolkWales Online Magazine |access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Reviewing the album for [[Folk Radio UK]], David Kidman said: \"Steve\u2019s unafraid to name and shame, and as always he does so with a potent combination of lyrical poetry, delicious wit and darkly puckish humour...The album has an intimate, sharing quality, having been recorded simply at Steve\u2019s own home in Cheltenham...

In 1968, with Tinderbox, Ashley recorded a live radio session with folk singer [[Shirley Collins]] for [[John Peel]]'s ''Night Ride'' programme on [[BBC Radio 1]]. In 1973, at the request of folk singer [[Anne Briggs]], Ragged Robin collaborated with her on arrangements and recording sessions for her album ''Sing a Song for You''. In 1974 Ashley recorded a live session of his songs for [[Capital Radio]]'s \"Sarah and Friends\" with [[Simon Nicol]] (guitar), [[Dave Pegg]] (bass), [[Dave Mattacks]] (drums) and Lea Nicholson (concertina).  In the same year he recorded a single, \"Old Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\" (for [[Gull (record label)|Gull Records]]) with backing from Fairport Convention.  In 1975 he recorded his songs \"Old John England\" and \"Fire and Wine\" for [[BBC Two]]'s show ''The People's Echo'' in a band with Dave Pegg (bass), Richard Byers (guitar) and Bob Critchley (drums). In 1978, Ashley formed the first line-up of The Steve Ashley Band for a one-off show at Rotterdam Folk Festival, with ex-[[Decameron (band)|Decameron]] members, [[Dik Cadbury]] (bass), Bob Critchley (drums), Al Fenn (guitar) and Chris Leslie (fiddle). For some ten years after this show, Ashley and Leslie performed together intermittently in an acoustic duo.\n\nIn 1979, a band was formed to perform the songs from ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'' in a number of venues with a special \"Family Show\". Joining Ashley on stage were Fairport members, Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg and Bruce Rowland, plus Chris Leslie and the melodeon player, Martin Brinsford. In 1980, Ashley opened a fundraising concert for Friends of the Earth with the classical guitarists John Williams and Gerald Garcia headlining at London's Roundhouse. In an encore, all three performed in a trio, Ashley's song, \"Candlemas Carol\". In 1981, he performed in a one-off trio with Chris Leslie and Bruce Rowland at Glastonbury Festival. In 1985, he performed with Fred Piek and Rens van der Zalm, two former members of the Dutch band, Fungus in Rotterdam.\n\nAshley was a close friend and creative associate of the naturalist author and filmmaker, [[Roger Deakin]].<ref>[[Roger Deakin|Deakin, Roger]]: ''Notes From Walnut Tree Farm'' ([[Hamish Hamilton]]), 2008, pp. 141, 282, 306, {{ISBN|978-0-241-14420-6}}</ref> Together they worked on two of Deakin's TV documentary films, ''The Ballad of the Ten Rod Plot'' and ''Stable Lads'', with Ashley writing and recording music for both. Deakin also recorded a radio interview with Ashley about his forthcoming release, ''Everyday Lives'', for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nAshley recorded harmonica for Richard Thompson's soundtrack for the movie, ''[[Sweet Talker (film)|Sweet Talker]]'' (1991).\n\nIn 1981, Ashley and Leslie were joined by Dave Pegg, Simon Nicol and Bruce Rowland to perform songs from Ashley's anti-nuclear Demo Tapes songs at [[Cropredy Festival]]. Then in 1999, after Ashley's eight-year break from music he got up with Fairport at the Cropredy Festival to perform his song \"Fire and Wine\". In August 2007, Ashley also performed his song \"Best Wishes\" with Fairport at the Cropredy Festival, and again at [[Birmingham Town Hall]]&nbsp;\u2013 as part of Dave Pegg's 60th birthday celebrations in November 2007. Also in November 2007, the arranger Harvey Brough invited Ashley to sing his song, \"The Rough with the Smooth\" to a specially written string quartet arrangement as part of Brough's 50th birthday celebrations at [[Union Chapel, Islington]].\n\n==Guitar and bouzouki playing style==\nAs an acoustic guitar player, Ashley's technique is unusual. He plays a right-handed guitar, left-handed, without changing the strings, in the manner of [[Elizabeth Cotten]]. So, effectively, the instrument is played upside-down. As well as using standard tuning he utilises a number of guitar tunings. He also plays a custom-built electric four-string [[bouzouki]]. This unique instrument was designed to include a left-hand cutaway, and giving left-hand access to controls, but is once again strung as a right-handed instrument.\n\n==Other artists who have recorded or performed Ashley's songs==\nArtists who have recorded or performed Ashley's songs include: The Arizona Smoke Review, [[Phil Beer]], [[Anne Briggs]], [[Maggie Boyle]], The Bushwackers, Fil Campbell, [[Paul Downes]], [[Fairport Convention]], Jo Freya, Grace Notes, Green Diesel, [[Wizz Jones]], Tom McFarland, [[Ralph McTell]], [[Johnny Moynihan]], Dobe Newton, [[O'Hooley and Tidow]], [[The Owl Service (band)|The Owl Service]], St Agnes Fountain, [[Martin Simpson]], Sproatly Smith, Christine Wheeler and [[Bill Zorn]].\n\n==Personal life==\nAshley lives in [[Cheltenham]].<ref name=\"Kidman\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Stroll On]]'' (1974)\n* ''Speedy Return'' (1975)\n* ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'' (1983)\n* ''Demo Tapes'' ([[Compact Cassette|cassette]] only; 1981)\n* ''More Demo Tapes'' (cassette only; 1985)\n* ''Mysterious Ways'' (1990)\n* ''[[Stroll On|Stroll on Revisited]]'' (1999)\n* ''Everyday Lives'' (2001)\n* ''Live in Concert'' (2006)\n* ''[[Time and Tide (Steve Ashley album)|Time and Tide]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[This Little Game]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Another Day (Steve Ashley album)|Another Day]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[One More Thing (Steve Ashley album)|One More Thing]]'' (2018)\n\n===Singles===\n* (with Dave Menday as The Tinderbox) \"Farewell Britannia\"/\"Rainsong\" (1969, unissued)\n* \"Old Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\"/\"Fire and Wine\" (1974)\n* \"Well Well Well\"/\"Fire and Wine\" (1975)\n* \"Down The Pub\"/\"Outside The Pub\" (1981)\n\n===Anthology===\n* ''The Test of Time'' (1999)\n\n===Compilations===\n* ''Tasty''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1975)\n* ''The Electric Muse''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1975)\n* ''All Through the Year''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1991)\n* ''New Electric Muse''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1996)\n* ''The Acoustic Folk Box''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2000)\n* ''Within Sound''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Shirley Collins]] (2002)\n* ''The English Collection: A Definitive Collection of Classic English Folk Music''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2004)\n* ''MidWinter''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2006)\n* ''A Box of Pegg's''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dave Pegg]] (2007)\n* ''60th Birthday Bash''&nbsp;\u2013 Dave Pegg (2008)\n* ''[[Three Score and Ten]]''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2009).

Ashley is best known as a songwriter and first gained public recognition for his work with his debut solo album, ''[[Stroll On]]'' ([[Gull (record label)|Gull]], 1974). Taking his inspiration from English [[traditional songs]], Ashley has developed a songwriting style, which is contemporary in content while reflecting traditional influences in his melodies, poetry and vocal delivery.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Biography and career==\n===Early life and career (1946\u20131971)===\nAshley was born in [[Perivale]], London, England and grew up in [[Northolt]], [[Middlesex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Ealing]]). In his early teens, he immersed himself in [[rock 'n' roll]], blues and American folk music. He saw [[Buddy Holly]], [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Lonnie Donegan]] perform live during his first years at secondary school. In 1960, he learned to play the [[mouth organ]] and developed a blues style influenced by [[Sonny Terry]] and [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]].\n\nAfter secondary school, he enrolled at [[Ealing Art College]] for the two-year Groundcourse under the tuition of [[Roy Ascott]]. Among Ashley's contemporaries at the college were many musicians, including (in the year ahead) [[Pete Townshend]],<ref>{{cite book|author= [[Pete Townshend|Townshend, Pete]]|title= [[Who I Am (book)|Who I Am]]|date=2012|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780062127266|page=56}}</ref> [[Ronnie Wood]]<ref name=\"Ron Wood Bio\">{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/ron-wood-20874863 | title=Ron Wood Biography | publisher=Bio | date=2015 | accessdate=8 June 2015}}</ref> and [[Roger Ruskin Spear]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} By 1962, Ashley was singing and playing [[blues harmonica]] in various bands. He also became seriously interested in British traditional music, performing unaccompanied songs in West London folk clubs. In 1964, he moved to [[Maidstone]], Kent to study graphic design. There he met [[Peter Bellamy]] and joined him as a fellow resident singer in folk clubs in Maidstone and [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]. At the same time, Ashley led the art college blues band, The Tea Set, on vocals and blues harmonica.\n\nIn 1967, Ashley qualified with a [[BA Hons]] and returned to London to start his first job as a graphic designer at ''[[The Observer]]'', working with record producer [[Austin John Marshall]]. In 1968, now as a folk songwriter, Ashley formed a duo with guitar player Dave Menday called \"The Tinderbox\". Managed by Marshall, The Tinderbox recorded a single for [[Polydor]] and a session for [[John Peel]] on his [[BBC Radio 1]] ''Nightride' show. The A side, \"Farewell Britannia\" was about the planned removal of the image of [[Britannia]] from the [[Penny (British decimal coin)|British penny]]. Just before the release of the record the image was saved on the [[Fifty pence (British coin)|50 pence piece]] and the single was scrapped. Shortly after, The Tinderbox disbanded.\n\nIn 1971, Marshall landed a production and publishing deal for Ashley with Harbrook Music which gave Ashley free access to recording time at London's [[Olympic Studios]], to record his first album. At this time Marshall also played the early demo tapes to the folk critic [[Karl Dallas]], who interviewed Ashley for ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', 1971</ref>\n\nActing as producer for Harbrook Productions, Marshall hired [[Robert Kirby]] to create string arrangements for many of Ashley's songs. He also hired a number of musicians to back Ashley, including members of [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], plus a section of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], directed by Kirby. By the late summer of 1971, the first version of Ashley's debut album was completed and offered to a number of major and independent labels.\n\n===Albion Country Band and Ragged Robin (1972\u201374)===\nBy the spring of 1972 however, the album was still unplaced with a label, and then Ashley was invited by [[Ashley Hutchings]] to join the first touring ensemble of [[The Albion Country Band]]. This line-up included ex-Fairport members, Hutchings, [[Simon Nicol]] and [[Dave Mattacks]], plus American fiddler [[Sue Draheim]] and ex-Young Tradition singer, [[Royston Wood]].  Sharing the lead vocal role with Wood, Ashley performed a few of his own songs plus a number of folk songs, including a 17-verse [[ballad]], \"[[Young Beichan|Lord Bateman]]\".  The Albion Country Band was signed to [[Island Records]] but the band broke up before recording, after just nine months together.\n\nBy 1973, Ashley formed his own short-lived folk-rock outfit Ragged Robin, with Richard Byers, Brian Diprose and John Thompson. They performed in clubs and colleges, and at [[Cambridge Folk Festival]], and also held a residency at [[Roy Guest]]'s Howff in London's [[Primrose Hill]].<ref>[[Colin Harper|Harper, Colin]]: ''Dazzling Stranger, Bert Jansch and the British Folk and Blues Revival'', [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], 2000, p. 253,  {{ISBN|0-7475-4810-2}}</ref>\n\nAfter this band folded, Ashley initiated the formation of a contemporary folk club at The New Merlin's Cave near [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross, London]].  With help from Anthea Joseph and Heather Wood \"Merlins\" was host to many of the folk scene's leading players, including [[Sandy Denny]] and [[A L Lloyd]]. The club's resident performers with Ashley were [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Peters]], Simon Nicol, [[Robin Dransfield|Robin]] and [[Barry Dransfield]], Lea Nicholson, and Ragged Robin's Byers.<ref>Hinton, Brian; Wall, Geoff: ''Ashley Hutchings, The Guv\u2019nor & The Rise of Folkrock'', [[Helter Skelter (books)|Helter Skelter]], 2002 pp. 242\u2013259, 279, 286. {{ISBN|1-900924-32-3}}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in 1973, Dallas described Ashley as \"one of the finest singer-songwriters in Britain, if not the entire English-speaking world\".<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', 15 September 1973</ref>\n\nIn November, Ashley signed a solo recording deal with Gull Records, and with a few track changes, his long-delayed first album was finally released in April 1974 entitled ''[[Stroll On]]''.\n\n===Solo career&nbsp;\u2013 recording, live performance and campaigning (1974\u20131992)===\nAfter a three-year wait to find a deal, ''Stroll On'' was met with widespread critical acclaim in the UK. In ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Maurice Rosenbaum declared: \"Ashley's own songs are the product of an extraordinary gift for creating material of true folk quality\"<ref>Rosenbaum, Maurice, Recent Records, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 September 1974</ref> and in ''Melody Maker'', [[Karl Dallas]] hailed it as \"the finest album since folk became contemporary\". By the year's end it was awarded \"Contemporary Folk album of the Year\" in the leading monthly folk magazine, ''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]''.<ref>''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]'', January 1975</ref> During this period, Karl Dallas frequently linked Ashley's name with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], as being in the vanguard of a new approach to folk song writing.<ref>[[Karl Dallas|Dallas, Karl]]; [[Robin Denselow|Denselow, Robin]]; [[Dave Laing|Laing, Dave]]; [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Shelton, Robert]]: ''The Electric Muse, The Story of Folk into Rock'', [[Methuen Publishing]], 1975, pp. 130,169, {{ISBN|0-413-31860-5}}; [[Karl Dallas|Dallas, Karl]]: ''[[Folk Review magazine|Folk Review]]'', July 1974 pp.4\u20135, 28</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Gull Records licensed the album to [[Motown]] in the United States and Ashley's first American tour was underwritten by that company. In spring 1975 Ashley undertook a six-week solo tour of the USA and Canada, opening shows for many artists including [[Leon Redbone]], [[Tracy Nelson (singer)|Tracy Nelson]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Chris Hillman]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (musician)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In a review of his performance in New York's [[Greenwich Village]], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] magazine'' said: \"Steve Ashley... is a delightful surprise ... The performer not only sings his originals well, but has one of the funniest of dry stage raps. His voice is good. His originals are sensitive, ex-of the Albion Country Band, Ashley can hold an audience.\"<ref>''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] magazine'', 11 June 1975</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armandalegmusic.com/features.html |title=Steve Ashley: still strolling on, 40 years on! |last=Weaver |first=Mike |date=August 2014 |website=Armandalegmusic.com |access-date=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nBack in the UK he recorded the follow-up, ''Speedy Return'', and undertook a series of solo tour supports for a variety of headline bands, including [[Supertramp]], [[Planxty]], Isotope, Gong and Fruup. However, by the end of 1975, Gull's deal with Motown fell through and Ashley was without a record company.  His planned third album, ''Rare Old Men'', was never released and it was not until 1979 that Fairport's [[Dave Pegg]] recorded, produced and eventually released what was his third album, ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'', on his own Woodworm label. In 1978, Ashley formed the electric folk \"Steve Ashley Band\" and this band performed sporadically for 12 years, including appearances at [[Rotterdam Folk Festival]] (1978), [[Glastonbury Festival]] (1985) and Cambridge Folk Festival (1990).\n\nIn 1978, at the Rotterdam Folk Festival, Ashley met the Australian folk-rock band, [[The Bushwackers (band)|The Bushwackers]], whose leader, Dobe Newton, asked Ashley to write some musical settings of poems by the deceased bush poet, [[Henry Lawson]]. As a result, The Bushwackers recorded three of Ashley's settings, and published four in their ''Australian Song Books''.<ref>''The Bushwackers Australian Songbook'', [[Sphere Books]], 1978, {{ISBN|0-17-005393-8}}; ''The Bushwackers Second Australian Songbook'', Anne O'Donovan Pty Ltd. 1983, {{ISBN|0-908476-12-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, Ashley became active in [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s campaign to ban [[Trident missile|Trident]] and remove US [[Cruise missiles]] from the UK.<ref>[[Dave Thompson (author)|Thompson, Dave]]: ''Wheels Out of Gear&nbsp;\u2013 2 Tone The Specials and a world in flame'', [[Helter Skelter (books)|Helter Skelter]], 2004, pp.152\u20133, 157\u20138, 187\u20138, {{ISBN|1-900924-84-6}}</ref> He recorded and released two cassette albums of peace songs. Around this time he began a part-time involvement in [[Oxfam]]'s publicity and campaigning work as a graphic designer and copywriter. During the CND campaign of the 1980s he performed from the main stage at Glastonbury Festival (with [[Bruce Rowland (drummer)|Bruce Rowland]] and Chris Leslie) and also solo to 250,000 peace protesters in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London. He recorded a single with CND's [[Bruce Kent]] and the Labour peer, [[Philip Noel-Baker|Lord Noel-Baker]]. Later, he took part in the blockade of the nuclear weapons factory at [[Burghfield]] and was eventually arrested for obstruction in the mass sit-in at the [[USAF]] base at [[Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire]].  This event was recorded in the song \"Sweet Affinity\" on his next studio release ''Mysterious Ways'' (Line Records, 1990).  In 1992, Ashley retired from the music industry to concentrate on his design and copywriting work for various UK charities.\n\n===Solo \"comeback\" career (1999\u2013present)===\nAfter an eight-year break from music, Ashley was encouraged to return by Peter Muir of the new [[Market Square Records]] label. First they released an anthology of Ashley's work, ''The Test of Time'' (1999) and, shortly after, an upgraded version of his debut album, entitled ''[[Stroll On|Stroll on Revisited]]''. This album met with many welcoming reviews and the original album was celebrated in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine in one its regular \"Buried Treasure\" features. Then, in 2001, Ashley signed a two-album deal with [[Topic Records]], and in April they released ''Everyday Lives'', his first studio album for ten years. Back on the road, Ashley performed as a solo artist and in duos with Al Fenn and [[Dik Cadbury]], as well as making occasional guest appearances with Fairport Convention.\n\nIn 2006, Ashley celebrated his 60th birthday with a special concert with Robert Kirby conducting his arrangements for a six-piece chamber orchestra. Also taking part were Ashley's friends from Fairport: [[Dave Pegg]], Chris Leslie, Simon Nicol and [[Martin Allcock]], plus [[Show of Hands]]\u2019 [[Phil Beer]], Planxty's [[Johnny Moynihan]], [[Brass Monkey (band)|Brass Monkey]]'s Martin Brinsford and many other friends, including his old partners from The Tinderbox, Ragged Robin and the Steve Ashley Band. The event was recorded and released six months later as ''Live in Concert'' on Dusk Fire Records. Then in 2007 Ashley released his second album for Topic, ''[[Time and Tide (Steve Ashley album)|Time and Tide]]'', with three new string arrangements by Robert Kirby. From this collection one song \"Best Wishes\" was recorded by Fairport Convention and the female trio Grace Notes.\n\nIn 2015, Market Square released Ashley's first stripped back solo album, ''[[This Little Game]]'', which was included in both ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and [[Folk Radio UK]]'s lists of \"The Best Folk Albums of 2015\". In a four-starred review for ''The Telegraph'', its Culture Editor Martin Chilton said that the album \"shows a craftsman at work...In Your Heart shows he still has a power to move with his songwriting\".<ref name=\"Best\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/best-folk-music-albums-of-2015/ | title=Best Folk Music Albums of 2015 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Chilton, Martin}}</ref> Paul Woodgate, reviewing the album for Folk Radio UK, said: \"This Little Game may just be one of his best\".<ref name=\"Woodgate\">{{cite web | url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2015/02/steve-ashley-this-little-game/ | title=Steve Ashley&nbsp;\u2013 This Little Game | publisher=[[Folk Radio UK]] | work=Album reviews | date=26 February 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2016 | author=Woodgate, Paul}}</ref>\n\nAshley's 2017 solo album ''[[Another Day (Steve Ashley album)|Another Day]]'' was described by [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Colin Irwin]], writing in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', as \"an understated album of sharp observations, lithe melodies and wry asides\".<ref name=\"Irwin\">{{cite news | url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/mojo-uk/20170124/283523680557316 | title=Steve Ashley: Another Day | work=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]| author= [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Irwin, Colin]]|date=24 January 2017 | accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> It received five-starred reviews in ''[[R2 (Rock'n'Reel)]]'', ''FolkWales Online Magazine'' and the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''.\n\n''[[One More Thing (Steve Ashley album)|One More Thing]]'', his solo album released in 2018, received five-starred reviews from the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]''<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{Cite news |url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/barnstormers-critical-eyes-and-seedy-hang-outs |title=Barnstormers, critical eyes and seedy hang-outs  |last=Johnson |first=Steve |date=27 September 2018 |work=[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]] |access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> and ''FolkWales Online Magazine''.<ref name=\"FolkWales \">{{Cite magazine |last=Tems |first=Mick |date=November 2018 |title=One More Thing |url=http://folk.wales/magazine/?p=315#One_More_Thing |magazine=FolkWales Online Magazine |access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Reviewing the album for [[Folk Radio UK]], David Kidman said: \"Steve\u2019s unafraid to name and shame, and as always he does so with a potent combination of lyrical poetry, delicious wit and darkly puckish humour...The album has an intimate, sharing quality, having been recorded simply at Steve\u2019s own home in Cheltenham...

In 1968, with Tinderbox, Ashley recorded a live radio session with folk singer [[Shirley Collins]] for [[John Peel]]'s ''Night Ride'' programme on [[BBC Radio 1]]. In 1973, at the request of folk singer [[Anne Briggs]], Ragged Robin collaborated with her on arrangements and recording sessions for her album ''Sing a Song for You''. In 1974 Ashley recorded a live session of his songs for [[Capital Radio]]'s \"Sarah and Friends\" with [[Simon Nicol]] (guitar), [[Dave Pegg]] (bass), [[Dave Mattacks]] (drums) and Lea Nicholson (concertina).  In the same year he recorded a single, \"Old Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\" (for [[Gull (record label)|Gull Records]]) with backing from Fairport Convention.  In 1975 he recorded his songs \"Old John England\" and \"Fire and Wine\" for [[BBC Two]]'s show ''The People's Echo'' in a band with Dave Pegg (bass), Richard Byers (guitar) and Bob Critchley (drums). In 1978, Ashley formed the first line-up of The Steve Ashley Band for a one-off show at Rotterdam Folk Festival, with ex-[[Decameron (band)|Decameron]] members, [[Dik Cadbury]] (bass), Bob Critchley (drums), Al Fenn (guitar) and Chris Leslie (fiddle). For some ten years after this show, Ashley and Leslie performed together intermittently in an acoustic duo.\n\nIn 1979, a band was formed to perform the songs from ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'' in a number of venues with a special \"Family Show\". Joining Ashley on stage were Fairport members, Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg and Bruce Rowland, plus Chris Leslie and the melodeon player, Martin Brinsford. In 1980, Ashley opened a fundraising concert for Friends of the Earth with the classical guitarists John Williams and Gerald Garcia headlining at London's Roundhouse. In an encore, all three performed in a trio, Ashley's song, \"Candlemas Carol\". In 1981, he performed in a one-off trio with Chris Leslie and Bruce Rowland at Glastonbury Festival. In 1985, he performed with Fred Piek and Rens van der Zalm, two former members of the Dutch band, Fungus in Rotterdam.\n\nAshley was a close friend and creative associate of the naturalist author and filmmaker, [[Roger Deakin]].<ref>[[Roger Deakin|Deakin, Roger]]: ''Notes From Walnut Tree Farm'' ([[Hamish Hamilton]]), 2008, pp. 141, 282, 306, {{ISBN|978-0-241-14420-6}}</ref> Together they worked on two of Deakin's TV documentary films, ''The Ballad of the Ten Rod Plot'' and ''Stable Lads'', with Ashley writing and recording music for both. Deakin also recorded a radio interview with Ashley about his forthcoming release, ''Everyday Lives'', for the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\nAshley recorded harmonica for Richard Thompson's soundtrack for the movie, ''[[Sweet Talker (film)|Sweet Talker]]'' (1991).\n\nIn 1981, Ashley and Leslie were joined by Dave Pegg, Simon Nicol and Bruce Rowland to perform songs from Ashley's anti-nuclear Demo Tapes songs at [[Cropredy Festival]]. Then in 1999, after Ashley's eight-year break from music he got up with Fairport at the Cropredy Festival to perform his song \"Fire and Wine\". In August 2007, Ashley also performed his song \"Best Wishes\" with Fairport at the Cropredy Festival, and again at [[Birmingham Town Hall]]&nbsp;\u2013 as part of Dave Pegg's 60th birthday celebrations in November 2007. Also in November 2007, the arranger Harvey Brough invited Ashley to sing his song, \"The Rough with the Smooth\" to a specially written string quartet arrangement as part of Brough's 50th birthday celebrations at [[Union Chapel, Islington]].\n\n==Guitar and bouzouki playing style==\nAs an acoustic guitar player, Ashley's technique is unusual. He plays a right-handed guitar, left-handed, without changing the strings, in the manner of [[Elizabeth Cotten]]. So, effectively, the instrument is played upside-down. As well as using standard tuning he utilises a number of guitar tunings. He also plays a custom-built electric four-string [[bouzouki]]. This unique instrument was designed to include a left-hand cutaway, and giving left-hand access to controls, but is once again strung as a right-handed instrument.\n\n==Other artists who have recorded or performed Ashley's songs==\nArtists who have recorded or performed Ashley's songs include: The Arizona Smoke Review, [[Phil Beer]], [[Anne Briggs]], [[Maggie Boyle]], The Bushwackers, Fil Campbell, [[Paul Downes]], [[Fairport Convention]], Jo Freya, Grace Notes, Green Diesel, [[Wizz Jones]], Tom McFarland, [[Ralph McTell]], [[Johnny Moynihan]], Dobe Newton, [[O'Hooley and Tidow]], [[The Owl Service (band)|The Owl Service]], St Agnes Fountain, [[Martin Simpson]], Sproatly Smith, Christine Wheeler and [[Bill Zorn]].\n\n==Personal life==\nAshley lives in [[Cheltenham]].<ref name=\"Kidman\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Stroll On]]'' (1974)\n* ''Speedy Return'' (1975)\n* ''Steve Ashley's Family Album'' (1983)\n* ''Demo Tapes'' ([[Compact Cassette|cassette]] only; 1981)\n* ''More Demo Tapes'' (cassette only; 1985)\n* ''Mysterious Ways'' (1990)\n* ''[[Stroll On|Stroll on Revisited]]'' (1999)\n* ''Everyday Lives'' (2001)\n* ''Live in Concert'' (2006)\n* ''[[Time and Tide (Steve Ashley album)|Time and Tide]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[This Little Game]]'' (2015)\n* ''[[Another Day (Steve Ashley album)|Another Day]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[One More Thing (Steve Ashley album)|One More Thing]]'' (2018)\n\n===Singles===\n* (with Dave Menday as The Tinderbox) \"Farewell Britannia\"/\"Rainsong\" (1969, unissued)\n* \"Old Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\"/\"Fire and Wine\" (1974)\n* \"Well Well Well\"/\"Fire and Wine\" (1975)\n* \"Down The Pub\"/\"Outside The Pub\" (1981)\n\n===Anthology===\n* ''The Test of Time'' (1999)\n\n===Compilations===\n* ''Tasty''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1975)\n* ''The Electric Muse''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1975)\n* ''All Through the Year''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1991)\n* ''New Electric Muse''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (1996)\n* ''The Acoustic Folk Box''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2000)\n* ''Within Sound''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Shirley Collins]] (2002)\n* ''The English Collection: A Definitive Collection of Classic English Folk Music''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2004)\n* ''MidWinter''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2006)\n* ''A Box of Pegg's''&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dave Pegg]] (2007)\n* ''60th Birthday Bash''&nbsp;\u2013 Dave Pegg (2008)\n* ''[[Three Score and Ten]]''&nbsp;\u2013 various artists (2009).

He was the founder and [[frontman]] of the cult British [[art rock]] band [[Audience (band)|Audience]] from 1967 to 1972, and 2004 to date.\n\n==Biography==\nHoward Werth was born at the Mother's Hospital, Clapton, East London, in 1947.  His earliest rock 'n' roll influences were 1950s' stars [[Fats Domino]], [[Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins]], [[Little Richard]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Everlys]] and [[Buddy Holly]] through to [[The Coasters]], [[The Drifters]], and others.  Later his taste expanded to the jazz influences of [[Charles Mingus]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Art Blakey]] and [[Miles Davis]]. Later still the voice of [[Ray Charles]] and the soul of [[James Brown]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, Werth went to art school at the outset of the pop-art era and was trained by some of the major British exponents of that movement. His graphic art skills led to a job designing album covers at [[Pye Records]] for [[The Kinks]], [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and the [[Gerry Anderson]] ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (and related) EP series, among countless other projects.\n\nIn the later part of the 1960s, Werth was gigging around London with various musicians and the notion of setting up the band Audience<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/audience-mn0000060060|title=Audience &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> first came to light.\n\nThe year 1969 saw the first Audience album and sharing the stage with [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Pink Floyd]] and touring with [[Rod Stewart]] and [[The Faces]], [[Jeff Beck]] and others. Audience was often supported by another [[Charisma Records|Charisma]] stablemate, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. Audience recorded three further albums with Charisma. The first album, ''Friends Friends Friend'', was produced and designed by the band members. Later legendary producer [[Gus Dudgeon]], arranger [[Robert Kirby (musician)|Robert Kirby]] and top record sleeve designers [[Hipgnosis]] were bought in for their follow-up albums ''House on the Hill'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-house-on-the-hill-mw0000264078|title=The House on the Hill - Audience &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> their most successful album, and ''Lunch''.\n\nIn 1972, Werth and [[Trevor Williams (bassist)|Trevor Wiliams]] decided to disband Audience to pursue other projects. Werth recorded his first solo album, ''King Brilliant'', in late 1972 as \"Howard Werth and the Moonbeams\". At the same time he was approached by [[The Doors]] to step in as a replacement for the late [[Jim Morrison]]. After a period of rehearsals in London, [[Ray Manzarek]] made the decision for The Doors not to continue without Morrison. It was an amicable split and, later on, Werth worked with Manzarek in Hollywood, some of which led to Werth's next album ''Six Of One and Half a Dozen of the Other''. This was originally released on Howard's own METAbop! label, in conjunction with [[Jake Riviera]], [[Elvis Costello]]\u2019s manager and business partner, the man who started [[Stiff Records]].\n\nDuring his time in West Coast America, Werth worked extensively with [[Captain Beefheart]]\u2019s Magic Band.\n\nWhen Werth returned to the UK he created a new label,4D LIGHT followed by Luminous Records, for his future releases.\n\nAlthough not shelving his solo projects Audience reunited in 2004.

He was the founder and [[frontman]] of the cult British [[art rock]] band [[Audience (band)|Audience]] from 1967 to 1972, and 2004 to date.\n\n==Biography==\nHoward Werth was born at the Mother's Hospital, Clapton, East London, in 1947.  His earliest rock 'n' roll influences were 1950s' stars [[Fats Domino]], [[Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins]], [[Little Richard]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Everlys]] and [[Buddy Holly]] through to [[The Coasters]], [[The Drifters]], and others.  Later his taste expanded to the jazz influences of [[Charles Mingus]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Art Blakey]] and [[Miles Davis]]. Later still the voice of [[Ray Charles]] and the soul of [[James Brown]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, Werth went to art school at the outset of the pop-art era and was trained by some of the major British exponents of that movement. His graphic art skills led to a job designing album covers at [[Pye Records]] for [[The Kinks]], [[Sandie Shaw]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and the [[Gerry Anderson]] ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (and related) EP series, among countless other projects.\n\nIn the later part of the 1960s, Werth was gigging around London with various musicians and the notion of setting up the band Audience<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/audience-mn0000060060|title=Audience &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> first came to light.\n\nThe year 1969 saw the first Audience album and sharing the stage with [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Pink Floyd]] and touring with [[Rod Stewart]] and [[The Faces]], [[Jeff Beck]] and others. Audience was often supported by another [[Charisma Records|Charisma]] stablemate, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]. Audience recorded three further albums with Charisma. The first album, ''Friends Friends Friend'', was produced and designed by the band members. Later legendary producer [[Gus Dudgeon]], arranger [[Robert Kirby]] and top record sleeve designers [[Hipgnosis]] were bought in for their follow-up albums ''House on the Hill'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-house-on-the-hill-mw0000264078|title=The House on the Hill - Audience &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> their most successful album, and ''Lunch''.\n\nIn 1972, Werth and [[Trevor Williams (bassist)|Trevor Wiliams]] decided to disband Audience to pursue other projects. Werth recorded his first solo album, ''King Brilliant'', in late 1972 as \"Howard Werth and the Moonbeams\". At the same time he was approached by [[The Doors]] to step in as a replacement for the late [[Jim Morrison]]. After a period of rehearsals in London, [[Ray Manzarek]] made the decision for The Doors not to continue without Morrison. It was an amicable split and, later on, Werth worked with Manzarek in Hollywood, some of which led to Werth's next album ''Six Of One and Half a Dozen of the Other''. This was originally released on Howard's own METAbop! label, in conjunction with [[Jake Riviera]], [[Elvis Costello]]\u2019s manager and business partner, the man who started [[Stiff Records]].\n\nDuring his time in West Coast America, Werth worked extensively with [[Captain Beefheart]]\u2019s Magic Band.\n\nWhen Werth returned to the UK he created a new label,4D LIGHT followed by Luminous Records, for his future releases.\n\nAlthough not shelving his solo projects Audience reunited in 2004. With [[Keith Gemmell]] and [[Trevor Williams (bassist)|Trevor Williams]] went back on the road, gigging in Germany, Italy, Canada and the UK, replacing [[Tony Connor]] with drummer/vocalist [[John Fisher]] (born 8 December 1960, Buxton, Derbyshire) and recording a live album ''Alive & Kickin' & Screamin' & Shoutin\u2019'' for Eclectic Records.\n\nAfter John Fisher died from pancreatic cancer on 27 September 2008, Audience recruited [[Letz Zep]] drummer [[Simon Jeffrey]].\n\nAudience re-emerged again when they played London's 100 Club in March 2013 which will be followed by a short UK tour later in the year but Werth, along with bassist [[Trevor Williams (bassist)|Trevor Williams]], has been performing on & off with blues rock band Blue Pulse since 2009.\n\nIn early 2012, a track recorded with Blue Pulse, \"Kebab and Burger\", is being considered for release as a single under the name HOWARD WERTH and Blue Pulse.
