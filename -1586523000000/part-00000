The diocese now comprises the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Aube]].  Erected in the 4th century, the diocese is currently suffragan to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archdiocese of Reims]].  It was re-established in 1802 as a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archbishopric of Paris]], when it comprised the ''d\u00e9partements'' of [[Aube]] and [[Yonne]] and its bishop had the titles of Troyes, [[Auxerre]], and [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]]. In 1822 the [[See of Ch\u00e2lons]] was created and the Bishop of Troyes lost that title. When [[Sens]] was made an archdiocese, the episcopal title of Auxerre went to it and Troyes lost also the ''d\u00e9partement'' of Yonne, which became the [[Archdiocese of Sens]]. The Diocese of Troyes covers, besides the ancient diocesan limits, 116 parishes of the ancient [[Diocese of Langres]] and 20 belonging to the ancient diocese of Sens. On 8 December 2002, the Diocese of Troyes was returned to its ancient Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Reims.\n\nThere is one priest for every 2,710 Catholics (2014).\n\nWhen Troyes was the seat of the Bishop as well as of the [[Comte de Champagne]], there was always tension between the two in terms of power and influence. After 1314, when Louis de Navarre became King [[Louis X of France]], the competition was more distant but the competitor far more powerful.  The Capitular Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne became a royal church, and the King tolerated no interference from the Bishop in his prerogatives.\n\n==History==\nThe catalogue of bishops of [[Troyes]] is first found in manuscripts of the 12th century, though it can be shown that there was a list of bishops by the 9th century. In the opinion of [[Louis Duchesne]], the list is worthy of confidence, at least from the 5th century on.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis Duchesne|title=Fastes \u00e9piscopaux de l'ancienne Gaule: II.

The Cathedral Chapter has eight dignities:  the Dean (who is elected by the Canons), the Treasurer, the Cantor, the Great Archdeacon (the Archdeacon of Troyes), the Archdeacon of Sessana, the Archdeacon of Arceis (Arcis), the Archdeacon of Brienne, and the Archdeacon of S. Margarita (Margerie).  There were thirty-seven Canons, one of whom was the Prior of S. Georges de Gannayo. The Canons were appointed alternately by the Bishop and by the King.<ref>''Gallia christiana'' XII, pp. 483-484.</ref>  The most famous of the Deans of Troyes was [[Petrus Comestor]] (ca. 1110\u20131179), who was born in Troyes and became a priest of the diocese; he was then professor of theology in Paris, and Chancellor of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.<ref>''Gallia christiana'' XII, p. 525.

The nave and fa\u00e7ade are of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Bishop de Barral left them and travelled to London, where he found the episcopal sentiment much more rigorous. Nonetheless, in 1791 he wrote a letter in which he approved the submission, though without blaming the recusants.  In 1800 he declared himself for taking the oath. After Napoleon came to power on 18 Brumaire 1799, de Barral wrote to the priests of his diocese that it was acceptable to take the oath to the Consulate.  On 5 October 1801 he resigned his bishopric, following the demand of [[Pope Pius VII]] for the resignation of all French bishops.  He returned to France, and was named Bishop of Meaux on 18 April 1802.<ref>Fisquet, pp. 80-81.</ref>\n\nAs for those left behind, on 20 March 1791 the electors of 'Aube' met and elected as their Bishop Fr.

The Carthusians as well were rounded up and sent to the same place.  Their properties and goods were to be sold.  The Abbey of Saint-Loup was sold and its goods sold off, except for the relics, which were taken by Bishop Sibille to the Cathedral.  Similar actions were carried out at Saint-\u00c9tienne, Saint-Pierre and Saint Ly\u00e9.  Even the remains of the Counts of Champagne, Henri the Liberal and Thibault III, were exhumed and taken to the Cathedral.<ref>Babeau (1873), I, p. 428-429.</ref>  When the turn of Clairvaux came for the goods to be confiscated and the buildings demolished, Bernard of Clairvaux and Malachy of Armagh were turned out of their reliquaries and tombs.<ref>{{cite book|author=John O'Hanlon|title=The Life of Saint Malachy O'Morgair, Bishop of Down and Connor, Archbishop of Armagh, Patron of These Several Dioceses, and Delegate Apostolic of the Holy See for the Kingdom of Ireland|url=https://archive.org/details/TheLifeOfSaintMalachyOMorgair|year=1859|publisher=J.

The diocese now comprises the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Aube]].  Erected in the 4th century, the diocese is currently suffragan to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archdiocese of Reims]].  It was re-established in 1802 as a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archbishopric of Paris]], when it comprised the ''d\u00e9partements'' of [[Aube]] and [[Yonne]] and its bishop had the titles of Troyes, [[Auxerre]], and [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]]. In 1822 the [[See of Ch\u00e2lons]] was created and the Bishop of Troyes lost that title. When [[Sens]] was made an archdiocese, the episcopal title of Auxerre went to it and Troyes lost also the ''d\u00e9partement'' of Yonne, which became the [[Archdiocese of Sens]]. The Diocese of Troyes covers, besides the ancient diocesan limits, 116 parishes of the ancient [[Diocese of Langres]] and 20 belonging to the ancient diocese of Sens. On 8 December 2002, the Diocese of Troyes was returned to its ancient Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Reims.\n\nThere is one priest for every 2,710 Catholics (2014).\n\nWhen Troyes was the seat of the Bishop as well as of the [[Comte de Champagne]], there was always tension between the two in terms of power and influence. After 1314, when Louis de Navarre became King [[Louis X of France]], the competition was more distant but the competitor far more powerful.  The Capitular Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne became a royal church, and the King tolerated no interference from the Bishop in his prerogatives.\n\n==History==\nThe catalogue of bishops of [[Troyes]],  is first found in manuscripts of the 12th century, though it can be shown that there was a list of bishops by the 9th century. In the opinion of [[Louis Duchesne]], the list is worthy of confidence, from the 5th century on at least.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis Duchesne|title=Fastes \u00e9piscopaux de l'ancienne Gaule: II.

The Cathedral Chapter has eight dignities:  the Dean (who is elected by the Canons), the Treasurer, the Cantor, the Great Archdeacon (the Archdeacon of Troyes), the Archdeacon of Sessana, the Archdeacon of Arceis (Arcis), the Archdeacon of Brienne, and the Archdeacon of S. Margarita (Margerie).  There were thirty-seven Canons, one of whom was the Prior of S. Georges de Gannayo. The Canons were appointed alternately by the Bishop and by the King.<ref>''Gallia christiana'' XII, pp. 483-484.</ref>  The most famous of the Deans of Troyes was [[Petrus Comestor]] (ca. 1110\u20131179), who was born in Troyes and became a priest of the diocese; he was then professor of theology in Paris, and Chancellor of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.<ref>''Gallia christiana'' XII, p. 525.

Bishop de Barral left them and travelled to London, where he found the episcopal sentiment much more rigorous. Nonetheless, in 1791 he wrote a letter in which he approved the submission, though without blaming the recusants.  In 1800 he declared himself for taking the oath. After Napoleon came to power on 18 Brumaire 1799, de Barral wrote to the priests of his diocese that it was acceptable to take the oath to the Consulate.  On 5 October 1801 he resigned his bishopric, following the demand of [[Pope Pius VII]] for the resignation of all French bishops.  He returned to France, and was named Bishop of Meaux on 18 April 1802.<ref>Fisquet, pp. 80-81.</ref>\n\nAs for those left behind, on 20 March 1791 the electors of 'Aube' met and elected as their Bishop Fr.

The Carthusians as well were rounded up and sent to the same place.  Their properties and goods were to be sold.  The Abbey of Saint-Loup was sold and its goods sold off, except for the relics, which were taken by Bishop Sibille to the Cathedral.  Similar actions were carried out at Saint-\u00c9tienne, Saint-Pierre and Saint Ly\u00e9.

It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on [[turntablism]], the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using [[record player]]s and sound effect generators, and features 94 [[remix]]es of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.\n\nTo score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and \"scratch\" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a ''Guitar Hero'' guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including [[DJ Shadow]], [[Z-Trip]], [[DJ AM]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Daft Punk]], and [[Benny Benassi]].\n\n''DJ Hero'' was generally well received by game journalists, praising the departure from the ''Guitar Hero'' series\u2013style of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, ''DJ Hero'' is stated by [[NPD Group]] to be the highest-grossing new [[intellectual property]] of 2009 in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Djhero1.jpg|thumb|left|''DJ Hero'' presents the player with three tracks corresponding to the buttons on the turntable controller, along with features to insert beats or to adjust the crossfader.

The game features [[score attack]] gameplay similar to the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable [[Phonograph|turntable]] that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfader]], and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game.<ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite magazine | title = DJ Hero: Drop the Needle | magazine = [[Game Informer]] | pages = 46\u201351 | date = June 2009 }}</ref> A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players.<ref name=\"gi e3\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200906/N09.0602.1027.10806.htm |title=Activision Round-up: Guitar Hero 5, DJ Hero, Blur And More |first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605090506/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200906/N09.0602.1027.10806.htm |archivedate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Notes travel in an arc across a spinning [[Gramophone record|record]] on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to ''Guitar Hero'''s Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/><ref name=\"gi e3\"/> The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out.

It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on [[turntablism]], the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using [[record player]]s and sound effect generators, and features 94 [[remix]]es of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.\n\nTo score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and \"scratch\" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a ''Guitar Hero'' guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including [[DJ Shadow]], [[Z-Trip]], [[DJ AM]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Daft Punk]], and [[Benny Benassi]].\n\n''DJ Hero'' was generally well received by game journalists, praising the departure from the ''Guitar Hero'' series\u2013style of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, ''DJ Hero'' is stated by [[NPD Group]] to be the highest-grossing new [[intellectual property]] of 2009 in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Djhero1.jpg|thumb|left|''DJ Hero'' presents the player with three tracks corresponding to the buttons on the turntable controller, along with features to insert beats or to adjust the crossfader.

The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable [[Phonograph|turntable]] that supports 3 \"stream\" buttons, an effects dial, a [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfader]], and a \"Euphoria\" button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game.<ref name=\"gi preview\">{{cite magazine | title = DJ Hero: Drop the Needle | magazine = [[Game Informer]] | pages = 46\u201351 | date = June 2009 }}</ref> A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players.<ref name=\"gi e3\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200906/N09.0602.1027.10806.htm |title=Activision Round-up: Guitar Hero 5, DJ Hero, Blur And More |first=Meagan |last=VanBurkleo |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-06-02 |magazine=[[Game Informer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605090506/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200906/N09.0602.1027.10806.htm |archivedate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Notes travel in an arc across a spinning [[Gramophone record|record]] on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> \"Euphoria\" is equivalent to ''Guitar Hero'''s Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/> There is also a \"Rewind\" meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance.<ref name=\"gi preview\"/><ref name=\"gi e3\"/> The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out.

First, ballistic missiles that fly above the atmosphere have a much longer range than would be possible for [[cruise missiles]] of the same size. Powered rocket flight through thousands of kilometers of air would require vastly greater amounts of fuel, making the launch vehicles larger and easier to detect and intercept. Powered missiles that can cover similar ranges, such as cruise missiles, do not use rocket motors for the majority of their flight, but instead use more economical jet engines. However, cruise missiles have not made ballistic missiles obsolete, due to the second major advantage: ballistic missiles can travel extremely quickly along their flight path. An ICBM can strike a target within a 10,000&nbsp;km range in about 30 to 35 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} With terminal speeds of over 5,000&nbsp;m/s, ballistic missiles are much harder to [[Missile defense|intercept]] than cruise missiles, due to the much shorter time available.

The primary reasons to choose a depressed trajectory are to evade [[anti-ballistic missile]] systems by reducing the time available to shoot down the attacking vehicle (especially during the vulnerable burn-phase against space-based ABM systems) or a nuclear [[first-strike]] scenario.<ref>Science & Global Security, 1992, Volume 3, pp.101-159 Depressed Trajectory SLBMs: A Technical Evaluation and Arms Control Possibilities [http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/3_1-2gronlund.pdf]</ref> An alternate, non-military, purpose for a depressed trajectory is in conjunction with the [[space plane]] concept with use of [[air-breathing engine]]s, which requires the ballistic missile to remain low enough inside the atmosphere for air-breathing engines to function.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Anti-ballistic missile]]\n*[[List of ICBMs]]\n*[[List of NATO reporting names for ballistic missile submarines]]\n*[[Surface-to-surface missile]]\n*[[Weapons of mass destruction]]\n*[[List of missiles]]\n*[[List of missiles by nation]]\n*[[List of currently active missiles of the United States military]]\n*[[NATO reporting name]] (has lists of various Soviet missiles)\n*[[Payload]]\n*[[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|MIRV]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*Needham, Joseph (1986).
